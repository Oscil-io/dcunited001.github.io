          <p>In the future, we’ll forget creativity’s eminance &amp; it won’t be
something we realize we miss once it’s gone. The path from whence we
came will be hidden and inconstructible. Adumbrating sensory overload
will occlude our path, if we even think to look for it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Honestly, as dysfunctional as I have been, I miss whatever part of me
thought to write this down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exponential development of culture threatens to detach us from the
aspects of life that precipitate creativity.  The nature of
postmodernism, combined with desensitization and the pruning of
adjunct appurtenance supplanted by technology, all may lead us to a
place where it is incredibly difficult to form new ideas. Even
distinguishing novel ideas becomes difficult.  The motivation for
discovery is mostly diminished, as the effort required to identify and
demonstrate novelty intensifies. Yet, novelty’s increasing scarcity
will augment the rewards for a select few.</p>

<p>In a world where almost everything has been discovered, how does one
cultivate creativity? There is a skill of creating something without
knowing about it.  Some ideas are just natural extensions of others;
maybe two to three steps away.  If you’re lucky, you’ll have a head
start on those innovations which are so close the something that
exists and is well known.  Yet, these ideas will naturally be reached
by most people who think about them.</p>

<p>Other ideas and techniques are much more difficult to reach. If you’re
lucky, you identify something truly new that can be recombinated with
everything applicable. These gems may require excruciating
introspection and magnificent insight.  Being capable of this kind of
creativity is a skill! Some have a talent for it, but it can be
practiced, improved and understood. It is not some mysticism only
possible for eccentrics.</p>

<h3 id="life-is-miracle-grow-for-creatives">Life is Miracle Grow for Creatives</h3>

<p>Some artists seem to have personalities that naturally enable them to
be more creative.  It can be some strength of character that the have,
like an inquisitive thirst for variety in experience or a curiousity
for understanding what most would consider distasteful. Or maybe some
quirk or deficiency that drives the experiences to nurture
creativity. Often, one becomes creative out of raw struggle to
transcend limitation or understand some challenge.  They develop such
an intimate, intricate knowledge of a domain because their thirst
consumes them.  They articulate this understanding by filling their
works with vividly distinguished statements demonstrating depth of
knowledge about those domains.</p>

<h3 id="windmills-on-broadband">Windmills on Broadband</h3>

<p>Limitations to communication and cultural transmission have been
evaporating since the introduction of broadband and pervasion of
internet video. When I wanted to learn how to windmill from the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050415014353/http://www.angelfire.com/hiphop2/mothergoose/">Mother Goose Ultimate Windmill Guide</a>.
It was hard as shit to teach myself that.  After a few months of
rolling around in my garage, I miraculously met a bboy that helped me
get continuous mills down. My point is, in case you just popped out of
a coma, every formerly obscure subculture from breakdancing to
cup-stacking has been spreading like wildfire. In the 90’s, if you
weren’t in an urban area, you never saw bboy’s breaking it down,
unless you rented Beat Street from Blockbuster.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My favorite aspect of breakdancing? It’s a skill that you can
practice and pride yourself on, where the only requirement is
physical coordination and a pair of shoes. And maybe some parachute
pants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The internet lead to an acceleration of modernization on par with the
phenomenon of modernization itself.  By 2006, after YouTube firmly
established itself, instruction or exposure for nearly any subculture
you could be interested became available over a broadband connection,
facilitating the recombination of those subcultures into new
artforms.  Broadband was the equivalent of strapping a jet turbine to
modernization.</p>

<p>The speed at which data could barrel through Al Gore’s series of tubes
no longer held us back. The next major growth restraints were average
time spent online, communication response time and service
availability, which were eliminated by iPhone and smartphones by 2010.</p>

<h3 id="harnessing-isolation">Harnessing Isolation</h3>

<p>When I first started jamskating, from about 2003 until early 2005, I
only had one person to practice with. Youtube wasn’t available, I had
just upgraded from dial-up to broadband and we couldn’t travel to
learn moves from other skaters. So we were forced to work with what we
had and we struggled hard to come up with our own stuff. It was hard,
but if we didn’t try to create moves, we would have been limited to
maybe two dozen. Because we spent so much time thinking about what
constituted a move in search of new combo’s, we began to intuitively
deconstruct what we knew and eventually created a plethora of new
stuff …. Of course, now that I look for my 2006 singles/doubles
videos online, they are <em>all conveniently missing</em>, instead of just
<em>mostly</em> conveniently missing.  Wow. This is not the first time I’ve
been scrubbed, it’s honestly $#@!’ing typical. Maybe this is for the
best?  LMAO.  Fuck it, take what they will, I will always know…</p>

<p>… Moving on</p>

<h3 id="metamodernism">Metamodernism</h3>

<p>Metamodernism looks at cycles that transition between
the modern and postmodern trends.  These cycles are like waves that
ripple in a pond.  Modernism creates the original waves that bring
together disparate cultural elements, which were originally separated
geographically.  And postmodernism is a reaction to modernism, where
it is clear in art and culture that people seek to differentiate
themselves by reaching further or seeking to combinate elements that
others have missed.  So, postmodernism is represented by the waves
that are reflected off the edge of the pond that mix and mesh
together.  But, since there is always cultural disparity created by
the dispersion of new culture, there is a continual, cyclical
interplay between the notion of modernism and postmodernism.  That’s
how I understand it anyways. Also, IMO, metamodernism is about seeking
to understand the trends and factors that create the basis on which
art movements are driven and on which art can be judged to be novel
and original.</p>

<h3 id="exercising-our-creative-muscles">Exercising Our Creative Muscles</h3>

<p>However, in a world standing on the shoulders of giants – who are, in
turn, standing on giants all the way down – several things become
limiting factors for creativity which present unique challenges. There
is the sheer scale of time require to learn all the necessary skills
to advance a field.  This is a huge issue and so is all the repeat
information you’ll need to process when learning the required skills.</p>

<p>Yet there is another more subtle limiting factor for us inhabitants of
our postmodern world. In a world where mostly everything has been done
in some way or another, people have less of a reward system in place
to exercise their creative muscles. The opporunity for creativity
dwindles and the cost for true invention skyrockets. Our drive to
create diminshes, but our thirst doesn’t disappear. Like anything
else, if you don’t use it, you lose it.</p>

<p>We’re two steps away from a world where it’s possible to download
jujitsu from the matrix – yet, the need for many skills will be
supplanted by tech.  Outside of amusement or curiousity, there would
be many skills we wouldn’t need to download. We can currently learn
nearly anything we want for free with Coursera and other online
education tools. We are more in control of the design and development
of our mind than ever before. But you can’t so easily teach someone to
be as creative as the people who struggled to innovate in the first
place.</p>

<h2 id="the-paradox-of-creativity">The Paradox of Creativity</h2>

<p>For people to profit from discoveries in society, there are more
efficient ways to teach skills and subjects, but it’s one that may or
may not foster creative aptitude.  It is simple with technology, but
not easy, to optimize the education systems on quantity of knowledge
developed – though technology never replaces the community of IRL
college and school. Yet, this is orthogonal to the knowledge required
for creative process.  And I would say that there is no set of
knowledge which could completely replace the experience and passion
that drives the creative process.</p>

<p>Speaking firsthand, in a world where anyone can conjure up youtube
videos of any fantastic combination of keywords, I’ve found myself
desensitized to what should be truly amazing. We’ve become so
oversaturated with access to prime content, sorted by viewcount and
rating, that we can easily lose appreciation for the amazing
experiences around us. It’s like reality porn, since it strongly warps
our notion of what’s normal. It can drive people to strive harder, but
obviously may lead to unrealistic expectations. For me, watching some
amazing maker videos would stimulate my imagination and simultaneously
stem my desire to try it or something like it, since it had been done
before. This led me to avoid learning some skills altogether, had I
just been willing to work very hard to experience something without
feeling a need for that project to be something <em>new</em>.</p>

<h3 id="the-power-of-the-unknown">The Power of the Unknown</h3>

<p>In my head, a reel is playing my 2004 image of an amazing bboy hitting
the most insane powermoves.  The windmill sensei that brought me up in
the bboy game comes to mind. I was so excited to meet this guy because
I had never met anyone who could teach me how to bboy and here’s this
guy that, breaking it down for 120 seconds, pulled 200 kids into the
center of the floor to watch. Fast forward just three years and
getting a crowd that size so quick was impossible.  The ability to
have vicariously experience anything at any time sapped the magic from
so much out there. And after TV shows like America’s Best Dance Crew,
it’s to be expected this wouldn’t be such a rarity in Roanoke.</p>

<p>But there’s really no replacing that kind of magic moment, where out
of nowhere, life hands you precisely what you’ve been searching for.
You just had no idea; your mind had no concept of it, but your heart
felt it. That is the power of mystery in life and it’s dying. There is
power in seeing something, which your mind struggled to assess, model,
measure and compare. That moment is what life is about, to me.</p>

<h3 id="cyberspace-wanderlust">Cyberspace Wanderlust</h3>

<p>We rob ourselves of the power of these experiences as we sift through
videos, tweets and shares to immediately satisfy our craving for
humour or wonder.  Though too often this understanding lies below the
veil of my conscious mind: it is desire for the ecstacy of
incomprehensible, imcomparable experience that drives my behavior; to
recognize it, to control it is to exhibit masterful control of my mind
and my life.  And to practice is it, one must meld with the beauty of
now and dissolve preconceived maxims or schemas for the world, the
experiences of which further inform our mind, all to often quenching
the flame of the child inside us.</p>

<p>This is because the more powerful our schemata for predicting and
controlling the world become, the more likely we are to lean on the
same schema again and again.  This results in constriction of variety
of experience and myopia and the elimination of dynamic behavior. And
yet, the world doesn’t ask us to do this; quite the opposite.
Structures in society tend to extinquish this, except in a few cases,
particularly for artists. If your livelihood demands strengthening
your inner child, I hope you realize how lucky you are.</p>

<h3 id="mastery-over-mystery-means-mystery-over-mastery">Mastery Over Mystery Means Mystery Over Mastery</h3>

<p>To tap into the power of the unknown, we have to develop the intuition
to evaluate the true value of unknown experiences, as well as their
fidelity and authenticity when they are vicarious or surrogate. We
also need to resolve the self-restraint and patience to wait for the
bona fide phenomena, instead of self-indulgence on a rough imitation.
You only have one first experience with something or someone, although
yes, one can argue that there are never two experiences or two things
exactly alike. And yet, the only way we can develop this intuition is
through experiences and by living life.</p>

<h2 id="paraparadox">Paraparadox</h2>

<p>When I meet someone, I always try to remember how it happened. I’m not
good at this, but I try. Some people’s creativity derives from their
model of attention and focus. They simply process different
information and notice different things. Optimal social behavior is a
very hard problem that requires storing and processing lots of
information. For me, that’s a challenge. For others, it appears to be
simple and natural. However, if you constantly process and store what
is happening around you, you are more aware of the present and you’re
more likely to remember the little things about the first time you met
someone, which IMO is irreplaceable.</p>

<h3 id="two-paradoxes-paired-to-form-a-third">Two Paradoxes Paired to Form a Third</h3>

<p>A corollary to this is to actually restrict the number of times you
might meet someone new or experience something completely new, since
that requires so much energy and effort on your part. Yet, it’s
another paradox, since trying to control the experiences you will have
limits your range of life experiences from which to discern truth.
The only way we can hope to discern a sense of truth in the flux of
life is by being exposed to as many authentic situations as possible.
Yet, again, so many religions and cultures develop their traditions
and social structures based on five or more generations of life
experience, so how would someone know when it is worthwhile to seek
their own understanding?</p>

<h3 id="de-nada">無 de nada</h3>

<p>As for becoming a master of the present moment, I’m sure there are
plenty of other exercises to strengthen your awareness, as well as
tactics for knowing how to apply your learnings.</p>

<h2 id="from-whence-we-came">From Whence We Came?</h2>

<p>Multitudes of people who are incredibly smart, but less creative,
especially in a world where anyone can instantly know nearly anything,
may leave us in a place where we can not see the way back. However, if
we can’t see the way back, how can we claim the way forward?
I view the Singularity as more of a Convergence, or exponential
development towards a sharply plateaued sigmoid curve, which may
consist of several steps over millions of years. But, with this
paradox of creativity, we may accelerate our implementation of science
and technology, but then stagnate our progression of it, eventually,
as we separate ourselves from our past.</p>

<h3 id="metaphysical-cross-pollination">Metaphysical Cross-Pollination</h3>

<p>Obviously, we must move forward; our economy demands it. Yet, we need
to keep a close eye on our trajectory.  Total loss of the factors
which fecundate and fertilize to cultivate seeds of creativity may
leave us stranded and lost. We need to maintain diversity of thought,
so that we can take advantage of the cross-pollination of ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jesus Christ, think of the bees!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Otherwise, 3 or 4 generations into this phenomenon of
quasi-omnisience, if we don’t expend the energy to maintain an
understanding of how we got here, then the skills, traits and seeds of
originality may be lost. An understanding of what motivates artistry
and creation, that could easily be forgotten. Or perhaps it is fated,
in which case, it is all the more vital for us to retain the memory of
this future moving forward.</p>

<h3 id="the-what-the-how-and-the-why">The What, The How and The Why</h3>

<p>This has happened time and time again in history: people understand
the “what” of their history, they may even remember the “how” of the
past, But, they almost always forget the “why” in their story. It’s
simple to remain aware of the what happened in the past two
generations. People may marvel at how the pyramids in egypt or stone
statues on Easter Island. But can anyone answer the Riddle of the
Sphinx? IMO, the same motivation that compelled the inhabitants of
Easter Island to construct their statues also, albeit partially,
answers that riddle.</p>

<p>Over the next century, this phenomenon of not understandy “why” will
rapidly become more difficult to understand.  In a world of overdriven
sensory overload, this is already a problem.  There’s so much
information out there, that it becomes difficult to discern things
which were once just common sense.  And, even though we appear to be
so much more “advanced” and sophisticated, our minds are suffering.
Needless complexity in our lives has distracted us through constant
overstimulation.  And it’s become common to philosophize and
“discover” some mode of thinking or phenomenon that everyone used to
be familiar with.</p>

<h3 id="its-the-food-and-how-we-cook-it">It’s the Food and How We Cook It</h3>

<p>You can already see how this has effected us by contrasting eating
habits now, compared to 100 to 500 years ago. Of course, there wasn’t
much decent medical or nutritional records then and no doubt that
poverty drove people to eat less healthy.  But if you look at
conventional wisdom about what were healty eating habits then and
correlate it to the beliefs of an average 14 year old, you might be
shocked.  In the past five years, our habits have changed and America
seems much healthier, but 25 years ago, someone thought it’d be a good
idea to load food with transfats.  And this is one example where our
minds, overstimulated with data and the latest scientific
understanding, thought it’d be a great idea to completely reject 5
centuries of conventional nutritional and medical understanding.  No,
those people had no fucking clue “how” their traditions worked, but
they did understand “what” seemed to work.  It has always been
valuable to draw generalizations across generations of observed
patterns in eating and living habits.</p>

<p>Science seems smart, but often lacks wisdom.  It appears to explain,
yet often lacks the “why.” Science without religion is blind; religion
without science is lame.  Ahhh, sometimes lines from TV shows can be
brilliant eh?</p>

<h3 id="generation-rift">Generation Rift</h3>

<p>The skills and hard work that we gave up in the name of convenience
also endowed us with invaluable knowledge.  Usually this we absorbed
purely from sensory experience, milking cows and whatever.  We made
valuable insights from our direct observations.  If we completely lack
the experiences that cause those observations, or if an entire
generation no longer shares like 90% of the observations or
experiences of the previous generations, then a rift is formed.  It
becomes more difficult to relate.  The younger generation has a tough
time comprehending the belief systems of the older generation and
simply considers them wrong, when there is immeasurable value in
sharing our experiences. And in a major revolution, the seniors and
elderly often find themselves targeted in the following years, as
their experience threatens the young power.</p>

<h3 id="tempered-from-experience">Tempered from Experience</h3>

<p>And for those skills which seemed outdated, the youth tends to believe
them to be a complete encumbrance.  We totally overlook how replacing
those skills with convenience leads to a vacuum in newer generations,
where there was once experience and knowledge. Therefore, large
branches are severed from the tree our or collective mind to which we
all map our belief systems and knowledge.  This reduces the diversity
of mind and culture, which encroaches on the universal scope of ideas
available to us.</p>

<p>For example, common agricultural practices are mostly lost to this
generation.  Robots are our friendly farmers and you can see their
perfect circular crops dot the terrain from 15,000 feet. But there are
great insights that can be attained from a life working in this trade,
or perhaps just a few humble years. This is stuff you’ll only
understand by doing it yourself for a protracted amount of
time. Someone could try to explain it to you, but the relevance of
this knowledge would be completely invisible, if it can even be put
into words. Farmers are closer to nature. Farmers learn to be closer
to animals, at least they do if they’re not using cruel factory
farming techniques.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sidenote: There is an economic benefit to restraint on cruel
agricultural practices, which is that it restrains livestock
production to smaller operations. This translates into higher
prices and profits shared amoung more people. Good luck with that
one though.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="lf-and-lfrasir">Líf and Lífþrasir</h2>

<h3 id="in-a-hollow-tree">In a Hollow Tree</h3>

<p>My point is, by severing ourselves from longstanding cultural
practices, we poison that tree, culling all the branches to leave just
one. In doing so, we stunt our own growth and our fate may be that our
great-grandchildren are all blind.  Or lost.  Or unaware of how they
were born into their world? We need to maintain the practice of
cultural practices and trades which can be automated, so that we can
continue to maintain this diversity.  It’s obviously not efficient,
but our future depends on our ability to understand our world. After
all, we only arrived here by understanding the world around us, right?</p>

<p>In 2030, education will be so streamlined that equivalent of a
bachelor’s degree could be attained in less than 10 years, instead of
17.  Innovation will eventually be driven by AI.  And the more facets
of life that are supplanted by AI, the darker the shadow of nihilism
will grow. Nihilism scares me more than any robot or zombie apocalypse
because we can never be sure to prevent or defeat it, no matter how
much progress we achieve.  In fact, it is progress itself that
strengthens the spectre of nihilism. The more we eliminate disease and
poverty, the more certain we are to struggle against widespread
nihilism.</p>

<h3 id="winning">Winning!</h3>

<p>Imagine that. The more we win, the more certain we are to lose.  To
lose hope. To lose progress. To lose understanding. The seeds of our
salvation and hope lie in recognizing this early and fomenting
cultural resilience against it. In a world where there is no reason to
work, we cannot forget the value of hard work. In a world where there
is no disease, we cannot forget the pain, fear and regret so often
experienced in a hospital or a deathbed. In a world where there is no
poverty, we cannot forget the valuable lessons we learned enduring
stagnant poverty. If we don’t manage to push forward with this
information, we will be forever cursed to being pulled back. When that
happens, we may have forgotten where we came from, so how can we know
where to go?</p>

<h3 id="never-forget-">Never Forget 天命</h3>

<p>So I hope we never forget the value of being creative.  It won’t be
something that we realize we miss once it’s gone because even if we
could turn away from the adumbration of sensory overload, we won’t
know where to look.  If we forget, we will be lost.  As progress
accelerates, culture exponentiates, as do its effects on society. With
culture, we have the opportunity to nurture our tree to see it blossom
or see it curl inward as we become fastidiously blinded by hubris.
Which one would give our children a resilient haven for
