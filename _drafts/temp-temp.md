Fin de siècle

Impressions - Given the name of someone to impersonate, come up with a situation they’d never be in.  If you can pull that off, you’ve got a good impersonation.

Non possidentem multa vocaveris               45 recte beatum; rectius occupat      nomen beati, qui deorum      muneribus sapienter uti
duramque callet pauperiem pati peiusque leto flagitium timet,               50      non ille pro caris amicis      aut patria timidus perire.

https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/270244-not-him-with-great-possessions-should-you-in-truth-call

Not him with great possessions should you in truth call blest; with better right does he claim the name of happy man who realizes how to make use of the gods' gifts wisely, is skilled to meet harsh poverty and endure, as one who dreads dishonor far more than death; a man like that for friends beloved, or for his country fears not to perish.

By the Sea




























































please forgive me.  but if i peer through the noise,
  then it would seem that a few things are consistent:

 (1) someone wants me to confused about what's going on
 (2) someone wants me to be quiet about what's going on
 (3) someone wants me to be satisfied in allowing others to speak for me
  - yet, *if i'm confused*, how could others possibly be getting the
    right message?
 (4) people want me to be patient for a cookie.
  - the cookie is coming. just wait for it. a few more weeks, tops
 (5) they _never intend_ to give me the cookie.
 (6) it would appear that they _never intended_ to give me a cookie
 (7) there is considerable energy invested around me,
  - yet i can't say i have any close friends that form a current
    support network. psychoanalytic survey says..... that's dumb as
    fuck
 (8) everyone is on my side.
 (9) everyone wants me to think they're on my side
(10) everyone wants to placate me by encouraging me to think that they are on my side.
   - when AFAIK, there's not a single person I know of that I can ask
   for help without feeling guilty for not being able to offer
   something in return
(11) my writing or personal history is not intended to remain online
(12) i am perceived to be dangerous
(13) i should be quiet because it's in everyone's "best interests"
  - yet, i can't tell who's interests i'm really playing into
(14) someone is shaming me for not feeling horrible about whatever it is i did
  - even though i've had to compartmentalize for the sake of my own
    sanity. in my current state, i can't really emotionally to anything
    at all
(15) even though, no one has ever let me know what that is/was
  - "no one tell him! do not tell him. absolutely do not do that"
(16) "they" have access to my online accounts. & possibly OS/Hardware
  - and possibly my location
  - and info about things i have said to no one but myself
(17) it is absolutely not allowed to question the authenticity of the narrative
  - whatever the fuck that is, anyways
(18) anyone that gets close to me risks getting hurt (it would appear)
(19) some people close to me appear to have been threatened
(20) not a single person really wants to get close to me
  - for everything that is claimed to be done towards my interests...
(21) anything i accomplish feeds the beast that ensnares & enslaves me
  - or so it would seem
(22) anytime i get close to accomplishing something, my energy is redirected
(23) as much effort as can be directed towards sussing out a confession or whatever,
  - no effort seems to be applied towards ever taking responsibility
    towards my own treatment in the past decade
(24) everything is perfectly timed

or perhaps i'm just completely insane...
