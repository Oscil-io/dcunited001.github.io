# Dutch Refugee Process



### Refugee Story

Hallo,

My name is David Conner. I regret to contact you under such conditions. I'm a former web developer living in Salem, VA. What I'm going to tell you is going to sound crazy, but I need to seek asylum in the Netherlands. I just want to live in peace, where I can either work or learn and be part of a community. Is there anything someone can do about this?

I have three or four separate arguments for being the victim of actual warcrimes in the United States, including psychological torture and actual physical torture. Though I just want to live want to live in peace, I fear this is happening, it is rampant, it is only accelerating and I fear for the mental health of another 100,000+ like me, perhaps more. If it is happening on that scale, I can't sit back and do nothing because I know how hard it was to stand up in my case. So many like me are bound to a chair, splashed in the face with horrible psychological and sociological abuse.

I do not understand why I have ever been targeted -- I believe it is originally because I was active about NSA and privacy violations on social media as early as 2005 & 2007. Until 2017, I thought my life had been uniquely depressing. I thought I was only the victim of "workplace bullying" at four jobs in a row. Only this year and last, did I begin to wake up to what is really going on. Everyone kept me in the dark, perhaps for my own sake. Nonetheless, the torment never let up and I was encouraged to be set off without understanding that they were targeting me for leaking or knowing what I was ever leaking.

I am basically not allowed to have an identity in America.  I am being tormented in public by gangstalking and covert hypnosis, which is tailored specifically to affect the sensory aspects of my Asperger's. These people never let anyone get close to me, unless it is to gain my trust to betray me later. At this point, it's the information related to my torture that is secret, which tells me these people will never let up until I am no more. I have endured far too much of this to ever consider letting my pain be for nothing, especially when I feel I might be one of the lucky ones.

My tormentors are using sociophysical tactics to isolate me with military efficiency, preventing any information from leaking out. However, I don't understand what information I could possibly have. I only ever shared short summaries of analysis on other articles I found on mainstream news sources. I thought I was being patriotic. I have never worked for the US government. Before I was 26, I even protested the Iraq War by foolishly refusing to sign up for the draft, so I am unable to work for the government or any publicly-financed institution. I tried to sign up for the military, but then I was recently thrown in a short-term mental facility.  

Anywhere I work, there must be someone there trained to handle me, though I have never understood this until now. AFAIK, it is a Facility Security Officer (FSO), who is required on staff for any business who handles classified information or higher -- and I guess that just means me. They are trained in NLP and covert hypnosis. In the past, they tormented me for a few short months, abusing my psychology against me, while isolating me from everyone else around me, many of whom I today realized must have known what was happening. 

I've been unknowingly enduring persecution in the United States, since at least 2011. This has been going on since at least 2011, in VA, NY and CO! I'm lucky to go to a coffee shop on some days, without being harassed. I'm tired of it. Every amendment in the Bill of Rights from one through eight has been violated in my life, including the third amendment and the sixth amendment. The third amendment: I live with my mother and she's forced to disrupt me whenever I make progress. There is nothing she can do and it must be like this elsewhere in America. The sixth amendment: I have never been charged with a crime related to this. I'm not sure which is more important: the third or the sixth, but I feel so sorry for my family, who's forced to endure this.

I'm just a punching bag to train people in these techniques, especially since they've upscaled these activities in my local area. They never intended me to know. They never intended me to change. They just wanted to hold me in place and let other people learn how to torment me and I have so much else to give to this world. I love life, in spite of this. I love learning about everything I can and, for as little contact as I have with the outside, I am one of the most intelligent people in America .

I'm afraid this scheme involves minors and extortion in the United States. The authorities here in Virginia and America are turning a blind eye to what is happening. I filed reports with the FBI today, as well as three reports with Interpol, but I doubt anything will come of it. I am worried that Western countries closely aligned with the US might not listen to me.

Over the past two and a half years, I've been harassed by what I think is Scientology and "Gangstalking". I have been anticipated and scooped up in the car/e of Neuroscience students at Virginia Tech (VT Hacks 2016 & 2017). It happened from late 2015-2016 at Colab Roanoke, lat at night. At Mill Mountain Coffee in Salem, they are running "Street Theatre" and covert hypnosis, which hasn't been too bad, but disrupts all the work I try to do, since I have Asperger's. It's "closed" when the "water ring" is in action, if you know what that means.

After feeling me out, they tried to get me to sign up for it and sign a contract in July 2016. However, it never felt right that I'd sign an NDA, but not get paid. I've woken up to the fact that it's basically covert hypnosis, which I'm beginning to understand has been used against me at several jobs. These people use "social physics" to almost algorithmically block you out of life. They use covert hypnosis to disrupt you in public. Targeting you like this only works if you have minimal financial/social options. It implies they have hacked your phone/computer and that they have "disconnected" you from society already.

=> I can help you dismantle these people's tactics and organizations! <=

I have an understanding of counterintelligence and I'm excellent at identifying connections b/w people, especially when they think they're operating with impunity. They have to operate in groups: there's almost always a monitor group who has "eyes on" a street theatre group, but sometimes there's a more senior group as well. There's also someone who talks to neutral people who may have seen something to ensure "they don't remember anything". There's a certain "configuration entropy" to their seating positions that is motivated by their tactics: they have to be close to you in order for you to hear their convo, especially if you have headphones. Each person in the group would prefer to sit as to maximize the field of view. Understanding how the groups and individuals manage their fields of view as they are sitting indicates whether it's a normal person or a group. The theatre group is easy to pick out because they always get right down to business like it's their day job.

However, I fear that these groups are decentralized. So, they have no way of quickly updating their processes. Therefore, they have no accountability and likely have no records. This more than anything, infuriates me. If they tell me it will stop, it's a lie. It's all decentralized. There are no records. It won't stop. They want me to have zero financial and social options, to ensure I'm as predictable as possible. I don't have enough money to flee. I feel like a coward for fleeing, while everyone else will have to endure the pyramid scheme of psychological torture that surrounded ME in particular, since any information related to my *identity* is classified.

However, I have the right pieces in place to block them from taking me out. There's nothing they can do. I contacted 21 senators last week. I contacted Interpol. For a long time, despite the vague threats, I've known there's nothing they can do. Still, there's nothing I can do, but wait it out. If I want to do something about this, I need to be somewhere I can network. The Netherlands is perfect because, if I have a case and need to pursue it, the Hague, the ICC, and the ICJ are right there. I don't want to hurt my country, but I don't want my countrymen to hurt. I have been dabbling in International Law and I know the basics. I know I have a case five different ways. Better yet, I can work with people in America and advise them on how to find people enduring this who need to get out. I know the tactics. I know counterintelligence. I know this stuff. They do not want me or anyone like me to leave because they exposed me to these tactics and claim that my identity and memories are "Top Secret" ...

If people are really scheming to use covert hypnosis at large in America, this could lead to lasting mental health consequences in 100,000+ people and there's no indication of a plan to address that. There is nothing I wouldn't do to stop that, including laying down my life. At this point, I have a clean conscience. I am strong and I love society that rewards virtue. America, for now, moving further away from that.

Bedankt Voor Het Luisteren,

David Conner
