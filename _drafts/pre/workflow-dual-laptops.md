### Pros

- Updates requiring a restart don't completely halt your workflow.
- better resource utilization 
- In other words, IntelliJ with 9 projects open doesn't bog down your email when it's on another machine
- one laptop per workflow context.  for me, this means:
  - one laptop runs iTerm with development processes, 
    - several instances of Rubymine & SourceTree
    - and several browser instances dedicated to development
  - the other laptop runs HipChat, 
    - a browser instances dedicated to gmail/calendar/etc,
    - another browser instance dedicated to pivotal/deployhq/etc
- I can code on one, while I research/blog on the other.
- Out of context notifications don't "Flux up my Flow"

### Cons

- Setting up two laptops 
  - though I can have an exact replica of my OSX Configuration set up in under an hour
- Installing updates twice 
  - sometimes, though both laptops shouldn't have all apps on them
