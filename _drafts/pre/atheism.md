- why atheism is arrogant and not a religion
  - doesn't provide a set of values to pass on through generations
  - is based on knowledge alone and is completely ignorant of wisdom
  - it's based on a constantly shifting set of knowledge which produces completely different conclusions at any time
    - that is, atheism today is completely different from atheism a decade ago
  - therefore, it's vulnerable to political influence
    - academia can be bought and knowledge can be manufactured
    - knowledge is not necessarily true
  - any philosophy can be misused for political gain, 
    - but atheism is especially vulnerable to this because it holds NOTHING sacred



Atheism, defined as the belief that there are no god(s) is itself a belief, forming part of a belief system.  This is a belief system that has a myriad of philosophic consequences for ethics, morality and public policy. The conclusions stemming from atheism include that it is unfair to base policy decisions on religion and that it is misguided to judge others on religious beliefs (hypocritical for some atheists).  These consequential beliefs are reached solely by believing that there is no god.  Quite simply, atheism is an ideology.  

But, if you would argue that "atheism is the absence of any beliefs," i would say that is false.  Atheism requires the belief that there are no god(s) -- this is a belief in itself.  Therefore, regardless of the philosophic conclusions that one may reach from this single belief, atheism is still a belief system.  

And a very shifty belief system at that.  Since atheism attests that because it is composed of no beliefs, the philosophy of atheism appears to be irreproachable.  This would make atheism moreso the inversion of a religion.  A religion where the zealots seek to dismantle, disempower and destroy all other religions, while maintaining rhetorical invulnerability through statements like "atheism is not a religion," "atheism is not an ideology," and "atheism is not a belief system."

And after atheist zealots have dismantled other religions, they do not replace it with anything, for they do not and cannot understand the value of religion. And so, you get what we got here: [failure to communicate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBBWUZfgRiw)
