two approaches for automated vehicles:
- autonomous artificial intelligence with computer vision and sensors
- networked operation of vehicles, which requires the above to some degree

however, while both have security vulnerabilities, networked operation in particular invites major disasters.

## vehicles with automonomous ai only

### vulnerabilities

- machine learning algorithms have implicit` vulnerabilities
  - if you know it's inputs, you can affect its output
  - if you know the algorithm's structure you can strategically manipulate its output
- so autonomous cars will have the same vulnerabilities that 
- intercept sensor data

- coordinated manipulation of sensor data

### attacks

- project image of deer into visual sensors

## vehicles using networked operation

### vulnerabilities

- do i really have to elaborate much here?

### specific attacks

- traffic jam
  - scenario where disaster occurs
  - then network attack causes major traffic jams block traffic
- block off vehicles ensuring maximum damage in attack

- however, hacks are often much more effective when indirect
  - it's hard to think ahead to imagine scenarios where an indirect effect is achieved
  - but i can imaging where networked vehicles are hacked in such a way that is mostly unnoticeable
  - but contributes to some indirect goal, perhaps economic

## but wait - even without computer driven cars, you're still not safe

- manipulate sensor data from an automated car in front of your target
  - get it to slam on it's brakes

- maneuvering that attempts to get other humans to react in a dangerous way
  - manipulation through fear

- i mean you can identify who is in a car by looking at GPS/accelerdata from comprimised
  - and that data's easier to identify by retrieving data from the car itself

- imagine a scifi scenario where a massive hack of networked vehicles 
  - results in the immediate death of all leaders of a political faction

- in soviet russia, car pulls you over
