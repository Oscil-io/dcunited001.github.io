- vulnerability of homogenous belief systems 
  - advantages of homogenous belief systems
  - propagating homogenous belief systems
    - religion, academia, myths, stories, movies, video games
  - examples of homogenous belief systems
    - religions, philosophys, cultural traditions, academics
    - some kinds of belief systems are moreso 'formative'
      - and thus, the person's behavior is almost entirely dictated by it
    - fascist regimes (kony, north korea, nazi germany)
  - homogenous belief systems are vulnerable to subversion because they are easy to predict
  - the more widespread the homogenous belief system is,
    - the easier it is to hijack on a wide scale
  - therefore, diversity in culture, ethnicity, religion, politics, etc
    - is crucial to a maintaining a culture which is resilient to subversion
    - therefore, diversity in US is an asset
      - yet, because we're so diverse, we can't be so easily accelerated into action
      - even though resiliance to manipulation is an asset
  - however, there will always be knowledge and beliefs which are shared amoung all/most people
    - these are like "common sense" things and the universal values that most ppl shared
    - so there is always at least this set of homogenous beliefs
