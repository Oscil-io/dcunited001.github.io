- fighting kony
  - removing kony & leadership won't correct the problem
    - kony's brainwashing is like a cultural virus that he intended to propagate
    - but when he's gone, this negativity and violence will continue to propagate
      - because the cultural virus he spread will continue to be propagated by whoever replaces him
      - i don't think he intended this
  - these child soldiers have been brainwashed
    - they've had this common belief structure created within them
      - through trauma and violence and negativity
    - but because this belief structure within them is so similar, 
      - that makes it easier to manipulate by "wrapping" it within a thin shell of beliefs
    - so in other words, one can use all that negativity as fuel and motiviation
      - to suppress further negativity and to correct all that has been done to them
      - they can be motivated by a desire to prevent future generations from experiencing it
    - but they would need some kind of common experience to instill this shell around their belief system
      - they would be hard to reach.  maybe the internet could be used in some way.
      - and reaching one would not affect much in the end. it needs to be fairly simultaneous.
