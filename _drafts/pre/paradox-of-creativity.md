paradox-of-creativity.md

this was originally titled "paradox of originality," but then i forgot what i was going to write about and lost my brief notes on the idea.  i'm not sure this is really what i meant to say here, but i think it is.

  - so basically, in a world where [almost] everything has been discovered,
    - how does one cultivate creativity?
  - there is a skill of creating something without knowing about it
    - some ideas are just natural extensions of others, maybe two to three steps away
      - these ideas will naturally be reached by most people who think about them
    - but others are much more difficult to reach 
      - and may require excruciating introspection and magnificent insight
    - and being capable of doing this is a skill!
  - however, in a world standing on the shoulders of giants, several things become a factor
    - the sum of time required to learn all the necessary skills to advance a field
      - this itself becomes an issue
    - but also, people living in a postmodern world, where mostly everything has been done in some way or another
      - mostly do not cultivate their creative muscles. 
      - some people seem to have personalities that naturally enable them to be more creative
      - other people become creative because they struggle so hard on learning something
        - that they develop that skill of learning new skills when no one is there to lead them
  - but, in this postmodern world, everyone can learn anything they want by going to wikipedia
    - and this is how you most efficiently develop talent to be most valuable in todays world
  - we live in a world that's like 2 steps away from downloading jujitsu from the matrix.
    - but you can't so easily teach someone to be as creative as the people who discovered all this in the first place
  - so this is a kind of paradox.  
    - in order for people to take advantage of the things we've discovered as a society
      - there is more efficient way to teach them, but one that may or may not lead to cultivating a creative aptitude
    - but having lots of people who are incredibly smart, but less creative
      - especially in a world where anyone can stream a youtube video of any combination of amazing things
        - and the experience of watching this video can stem off the desire to actually do it
          - "Simpson's did it"
      - this may mean that we accelerate our implementation of science and technology,
        - but that we stagnate our progression of it, eventually
    - actually i don't think this is as much of an issue as it could be, immediately
      - but that it very well could be an important issue soon
        - say, 3 to 4 generations into this phenomenon of postmodern quasiomniscience
        - by that time, if we don't expend a bit of time and energy properly understanding how we got here
          - and the skills that were used and what motivated us, that could very well be lost
          - this has happended time and time again in history: 
            - people understand where the have come from (the "what" ??)
              - and can mostly accurately understand one to two generations of history
            - people may remember the "how"
              - or they may be amazed at pyramids or stone statues on easter island
            - but they almost always forget the "why"
          - and this phenomenon of not understanding "why" will become infinitely more difficult to understand
            - in a world of overdriven sensory overload -- this is already a problem
            - there's so much information out there, 
              - that it becomes difficult to discern things which were once just common sense
              - and it becomes common to philosophize and "discover" so mode of thinking or some phenomenon
                - that everyone used to be familiar with
            - you can already see how this has effected us by contrasting eating habits now versus 100 years ago
              - and then observing how that effects our living habits
              - and correlating it to what the average 14 year old knows about the world
            - the skills and hard work that we gave up in the name of convenience
              - also endowed us with lots of useful knowledge
              - yet, we focus on how skills were mostly an encumbrance, 
                - and we totally overlook how replacing those skills with convenience
                  - leads to a vacuum in newer generations, where there was once experience and knowledge
            - so common agriculture practices are mostly lost to this generation
              - but there are great insights that can be attained from working in these trades for a year or two
                - this is stuff that you'll only understand by doing it yourself for a protracted amount of time
                - and it's stuff that someone can explain it to you and it'll go in one ear and out the other
                  - if they can even put it into words.
    - but i'm saying this phenonena of no longer understanding the value of a skill that's been replaced by convenience
      - relates to this paradox of creativity, 
        - whereby when education is so streamlined that a bachelor's can be attained in 10 years
          - or when innovation is driven by AI
        - we'll forget the value of being creative
      	  - and it won't be something that we'll realize that we miss once it's gone
      	    - because even if we could turn away from the adumbration of sensory overload, 
      	      - we won't know where to look to 

#PostModernism #ParadoxOfCreativity In the future, we'll forget creativity's worth & it won't be something we realize we miss once it's gone

#ParadoxOfCreativity Bc if adumbrating sensory overload doesn't occlude us, the path from whence we came will be hidden and inconstructible
