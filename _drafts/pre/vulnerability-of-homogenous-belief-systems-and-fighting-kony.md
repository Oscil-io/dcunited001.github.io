I stopped smoking weed because I can't help but think of stuff like
this, which i have no power over, yet is fascinating nonetheless...

- vulnerability of homogenous belief systems
  - advantages of homogenous belief systems
  - propagating homogenous belief systems
    - religion, academia, myths, stories, movies, video games
  - examples of homogenous belief systems
    - religions, philosophys, cultural traditions, academics
    - some kinds of belief systems are moreso 'formative'
      - and thus, the person's behavior is almost entirely dictated by it
    - fascist regimes (kony, north korea, nazi germany)
  - homogenous belief systems are vulnerable to subversion because they are easy to predict
  - the more widespread the homogenous belief system is,
    - the easier it is to hijack on a wide scale
  - therefore, diversity in culture, ethnicity, religion, politics, etc
    - is crucial to a maintaining a culture which is resilient to subversion
    - therefore, diversity in US is an asset
      - yet, because we're so diverse, we can't be so easily accelerated into action
      - even though resiliance to manipulation is an asset
  - however, there will always be knowledge and beliefs which are shared amoung all/most people
    - these are like "common sense" things and the universal values that most ppl shared
    - so there is always at least this set of homogenous beliefs

- fighting kony
  - as example of homogenous belief system to "hijack"
    - describe the difficulty in doing so.
      - the situation is self-perpetuating in that cutting the head
        off the snake doesn't kill the snake.
      - yet, the existance of this homogenous system, as terribly
        violent as it is, means that it can be co-opted
  - removing kony & leadership won't correct the problem
    - kony's brainwashing is like a cultural virus that he intended to propagate
    - but when he's gone, this negativity and violence will continue to propagate
      - because the cultural virus he spread will continue to be propagated by whoever replaces him
      - i don't think he intended this
  - these child soldiers have been brainwashed
    - they've had this common belief structure created within them
      - through trauma and violence and negativity
    - but because this belief structure within them is so similar,
      - that makes it easier to manipulate by "wrapping" it within a thin shell of beliefs
    - so in other words, one can use all that negativity as fuel and motiviation
      - to suppress further negativity and to correct all that has been done to them
      - they can be motivated by a desire to prevent future generations from experiencing it
    - but they would need some kind of common experience to instill this shell around their belief system
      - they would be hard to reach.  maybe the internet could be used in some way.
      - and reaching one would not affect much in the end. it needs to be fairly simultaneous.
