- illegal immigration is a powder keg
  - it's a serious long-term issue
    - that doesn't present enough incentives to be resolved
      - which is precisely why it's so dangerous: current trends in
        policy, while promising (i need more info, just assuming there
        has been some progress here) are not nearly enough
      - there just aren't enough benefits, politically, to really
        tackle this issue
    - honestly, we have way bigger problems *at the moment*
      - yet, the more time passes, the harder this becomes to resolve
      - and by acting like it's not a big deal really puts us at risk
        of lackluster progress
        - or acting like we have taken appropriate action to solve the
          problem, instead of pushing the envelope with our discussion
      - basically, if it continues for another decade or so, we risk
        to having to deal with 6% of the population, instead of 3%
  - illegal immigrants are criminals, by definition
    - but this statement doesn't actually make any judgements about
      their character
    - by definition someone labelled as an "illegal immigrant" must
      have committed the crime of entering the country illegally
  - most of these people of good character and only came here for one
    of the following reasons:
    - fleeing bad circumstances in latin america or south america
    - to pursue the american dream for themselves or their children
  - the reason it's a difficult issue to face is because there is no
    good solution
    - amnesty is a legal nightmare
      - it's unfair to those who went through the real process
      - completely lacks controls
      - proclamation of an amnesty program is tantamount to
        advertising free citizenship for anyone who can make it in in
        time
      - and there is no way to implement amnesty in enough time to
        avoid a massive influx of illegal immigration
    - massive deportation may work, but is equally riddled with
      problems.
      - obviously, there is an opportunity for racism. it would
        definitely
  - illegal immigrants in the country cause the following problems:
    - (1) the jobs that are being taken are really the least of our
      concerns.
    - (2) they don't pay income taxes.
      - it's not like they are dancing their way to the bank though
    - (3) they don't have employment rights.
      - this leads to tension, risk and abuse in (illegal) employment
        agreements, where they have no options for recompense
    - (4) domestic policies meant to stem the demand for cheap labor from
      illegal immigrants
      - these actually stoke the flames because now you have a slice
        of the population who is essentially backed into a corner
        - and is being starved out
      - they risk serious consequences of backlash from legal and
        illegal immigrants of specific ethnicities (not just limited
        to latin american ancestry)
    - (5) illegal immigrants seeking work (to feed their families) are
      committing crimes by working.  employers hiring illegal
      immigrants are committing crimes by employing them.
      - there are no social programs in place for this major chunk of
        our population: ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE with no social security
        in place (in the truest sense of the term)
        - that's three percent of our population with no options for
          stability and nowhere to go, if it gets "really fucking cold
          out."
      - people supporting illegal immigrants may also be committing
        crimes if they are knowingly doing so
    - (6) their children can't receive education
      - this leads to large amounts of idle, uneducated youth
        - it's bad. and when the issue is resolved, these children
          will suffer lasting consequences, as they won't easily
          conform to others of the same age in the education system
        - major source of long term consequences.
        - a certain minority who, if granted amnesty, *may* feel
          ashamed to admit to their past, for fear of judgement and
          for fear of being labeled as someone who is less capable in
          the workplace
          - because of a lack of education
          - or because a perceived lack of education
    - (7) if strict policies on stemming demand for illegal immigrant
      employment are working, then things are going to get real hard
      for illegal immigrants, including those who would otherwise be
      "model uncitizens"
      - this leads to about 3% of the population suffering serious
        hardship, with little options for money to resolve those
        problems.
      - that will lead people to partake in organized crime
    - (8) these people will become culturally isolated from the rest
      of america, having to live in the shadows, basically
      - major, major source of misunderstanding and conflict
      - i've never actually met someone that i know to be an illegal
        immigrant. never spoken to someone like that.
    - (9) there is no assurance that these immigrants have valid
      identification from another country
      - where do we send them back?
        - if they have no identification. they will probably lie and
        say their from tijuana or cuidad juarez.
      - there is major potential for abuse of our own systems here
        - someone may manipulate the system into getting a free plane
          ticket to basically anywhere they want
        - that's probably not actually such a serious threat though.
    - (10) the burden of cost to monitor and deport is placed on taxpayers
      - who can't be sure that there is a coherent strategy for
        actual resolution
      - this forms a bureaucracy, who's budget from year-to-year
        actually requires maintainence of the problem ... to some
        extent, anyways.
        - because of congressional and executive oversight, it also
        requires establishing reports demonstrating reasonable
        progress
      - but this is a major problem because the incentives behind each
        of the players suffer from major, major overhang and stifled
        discussion.
        - overhang as in the incentives are like a really wobbly jenga
          tower.
    - (11) implementation of policy risks fracturing families
      - when the discussion to construct a coherent policy never
        really occured.  or at least not to the extent that i would
        like to believe is necessary.
        - and i cover how a viable strategy requires secrecy, but what
          i'm saying if no one knows the goals we are pushing towards
          with resolving illegal immigration, how can they know how to
          react?
    - (12) and there's the major security risk when people connected
      to terrorism try to slip in.
    - (13) and if amnesty is announced, we can be sure that these
      people will try to slip in.
  - a disorganized strategy for immigration means
    - increased tensions for illegal and legal immigrants here
    - any concerted strategy for solving the problem requires some
      element of secrecy to be effectively implemented to prevent any
      unintended response
      - this necessitates circumventing the democratic process in
        congress
        - if you can't openly discuss something or suggest tactics
          because of it, then it's hard to put it into action in a
          democratic system
      - lack of discussion means that if the strategy changes from
        year to year and term to term, no one is going to know
        - which basically means there can be no coordinated, coherent
          strategy.
        - if you can't coordinate how the strategy changes from term
          to term (because of the secrecy) then how can you ensure
          that certain long-term tactics are properly executed
          - and certain long-term objectives are met
  - the solution starts by addressing economic/political issues in
    neighboring states (mexico)
    - we need work with mexico to establish mutually beneficial
      policies which create opportunities there
      - Microsoft manufactured the original xbox in guadalajara, for
        example.
    - transporting products from mexico should be cheaper.  right now,
      the transportation channels available to push products out of
      mexico and into america are suboptimal, AFAIK. i don't actually
      have much knowledge on the specifics, but i'm making inferences
      from a few key pieces of info
      - from what i know, i'm tending towards thinking that mexico has
        an infrastructure problem that prevents product from being
        efficiently exported
        - but i haven't researched this at all
    - whatever policy we undertake here needs to factor in
      strengthening our relationship with mexico.
    - mexican authorities need to be involved in stemming the flow
      - we need to present them with a choice, essentially
        - positive reinforcement for demonstrated traction towards
          solving this problem.
          - our numbers get better stateside, we encourage policies
            which help the situation
          - examples include cooperation on shared infrastructure
            projects or encouragement of manufacturing opportunities
            - however, if it's hard enough to create jobs in america,
              what business do we have promising to create jobs
              elsewhere, that's dumb
        - ... i don't really want to say "negative reinforcement" here
          - but we need to find means of motivating action here
  - need to motivate the legal and illegal immigrant populations to
    action
    - consequences for illegal immigrants to cooperate can't all be
      negative.
    - seriously, what incentive would an illegal immigrant have for
      putting themselves at risk to cooperate with the system?
    - i don't really know what our options are here... but i'd love to
      explore them and hear what ideas people have
  - and finally, solving this problem requires attention and
    compromise from both parties
    - the longer we wait, the worse it gets and the more negativity
      it generates.
    - we need some form of amnesty, the implementation of such a
      policy has it's own problems (stated above)
      - mostly, it's difficult to determine what is fair and what is
        just,
        - when requirements and process for this must remain secret.
        - and the discussion of it
