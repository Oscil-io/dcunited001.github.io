## The Boring Maths

### Algebra

**What it is:** Solve for x.

**Where it's used:** Everywhere. Trig, calculus, computer science, physics, chemistry.

#### Why it's relevant

Algebra strengthens your brains ability to perform symbolic and logical deduction.  That is, the deductive techniques that you pick up in algebra are applicable in many areas of life that have nothing to do with numbers or functions.  When you observe relationships between things, yet you lack all the information, you can deduce additional information based on what you have to work towards a complete picture.  And the techniques you learn in algebra to do this with numbers can be applied by your brain in other areas.

### Geometry

**What it is:** Triangles, circles and other angular things.

**Where it's used:** Trig, carpentry, design. used anywhere space exists.

#### Why it's relevant

Basically, the proofs in high school geometry are a great introduction logical thinking.  You observe rules that must be true in all cases and you learn to apply these rules in a strategic way to discern whether something is or is not true.  While strengthening this logical process is useful in itself, you can also observe similar rules that must be true for generally any concept or domain.  So you can begin to apply that logical, deductive thinking in a strategic way to make sense of the world around you.

### Trigonometry

**What it is:** The study of periodic functions that arise from proportions in triangles and the relationships between those functions.

**Where it's used:** Music, physics, calculus.

#### Why it's relevant

This ties together algebra and geometry and you're still building the basics that enable you to understand higher maths and pure math.  You're working with functions that are invertible.  You're building more complicated proofs and expanding you're vocabulary of theorums.  But still, trigonometry just isn't useful enough to the average person, who isn't planning on attending college. 

### Calculus

**What it is:** Derivatives and integrals.  Relationships between functions and their derivatives that implicitly exist.

**Where it's used:** Physics, business, computer science, any statistics that is useful.

#### Why it's relevant

Without calculus, statistics and the physical sciences are woefully inept.  In fact, no math up to this point has expanded the horizons for those fields as much as calculus does.  And no other math will expand the capabilities of statistics and the physical sciences as much, until you reach functional analysis and tensor calculus.  The difference between high school physics and college physics is that you have calculus.

More important, calculus arms you with the understanding that the rate of change is often more important than the value that has changed.  In business, it's more important to look at the derivative (rate of change) of something like income/profit than looking at the value of income/profit itself.  This is because by observing the rate of change of income/profit, you can set expectations for where that value is going to be in the near future.  And based on those expectations, you can alter your business' strategy to optimize the outcome.

However, like other maths, picking up these new tools from calculus expands your cognitive capabilities.  This is true in a general sense and not only for applied sciences or business.  Basicially, whatever you decide to measure, you can also observe the rate of change for those measurements.  So you might measure the number of lines of code you write in a week or the number of hours you spend working out or the number of calories you eat per day.  But, by being familiar with calculus, you will intuitively pay more attention to the trends in those measurements.

However, calculus is still not very relevant to most people.  In fact, it wasn't fully developed until the late 17th century.  IMO, this is because the problems to which calculus uniquely provides solutions (i.e. predicting changes of mostly physical systems) just weren't problems much before that time.  This is because, for the most part, in order for calculus to be useful, you need accurate means of measuring values from a system, which mostly didn't exist at the time.  Time itself couldn't even be measured accurately.  

My point is, outside of business, calculus is mostly useful in the sciences, which aren't actually relevant to a majority of people.  And because of the difficulty of learning the methods in calculus, many people won't make it through to the maths they would actually find useful.  (wut difficulty? lulz)

### Differential Equations

**What it is:** Calculus with functions that contain their own derivative.

**Where it's used:** Chemistry, biology, water treatment plants, audio, electronics, general relativity.

#### Why it's relevant

By understanding how the value of a measurement in a system affects the rates of change within that system, you can intuitively infer and predict behavior of that system.  Learning about differential equations will give you tools to model complex interdependent relationships in physical systems.  

A general example: the rate at which an egg cooks is not dependant on how high you have set your stove top nor on how long your frying pan has been heating up.  Instead, it's dependant on how much heat your frying pan has absorbed.  However, as your frying pan heats up, its rate of heat absorption will change.  Additionally, its rate of heat absorbtion is affected by whether or not you're currently cooking something else.  Like bacon.

All in all, the best way to measure that you've reached the optimal frypan cooking temperature for bacon or eggs is by feel.  Everyone knows that.  However, by understanding the model and behavior of the system, you can predict how the state of the system will affect measurements elsewhere in that system without constantly measuring.

While you obviously don't need to learn Diff-EQ to cook bacon and eggs, the insights you gain into modeling behavior of physical systems is invaluable.  You'll be more capable of constructing a mental model and confidently making inferences about its behavior.  Additionally, you learn that for many problems, their solution depends on the initial value.

Again.  Still not relevant for most people.  Too much calculus.  Most people don't deal with physical systems.

### Matrices

**What it is:** Multiplication and scalar operations for sets.

**Where it's used:** Linear algebra, artificial intelligence, solving algebra problems faster.

#### Why it's relevant

In and of themselves, matrices are not useful.  Matrices are crucial for providing the basis you need for linear algebra and higher maths.  But many high schoolers unfortunately question the value of learning about matrix math because they haven't seen the applications of linear algebra.  They assume because the math they're currently learning seems useless and irrelevant that higher maths would also be irrelevant.

### Logic

**What it is:** And/Or/Not. Truth tables and De Morgan's laws.

**Where it's used:** Probability, logic gates in computer chips

#### Why it's relevant

Mathematic logic provides a basis for further math.  In itself, it's not very useful because most problems aren't so cut and dry.  That is, most problems don't work with binary values. 

## The Useful Maths You Never Studied

Ok, everything you've learned so far has been a foundation, but the problems you can solve are still *incredibly limited!* Most advanced high schoolers will graduate with less than what we've discussed so far.  It's very easy to see why most people disdain math.  It seems so abstract and -- if you only understand what I've covered thus far -- then, it's very hard to relate to life. 

However, each of the maths described below will greatly expand the set of problems you can model, solve and -- most important -- understand.  Problems that seemed impossible or just not mathematic Problems that beforehand seemed unique will began to share similarities with every other problem you've encountered.  Learning these maths will literally expand your mind.  This is because you can learn to drive your own software and hardware more efficiently.

### Linear Algebra

**What it is:** Algebra generalized to n-dimensions by using matrices as notation.

**Where it's used:** Statistics, linear regression, artificial intelligence, engineering.

#### Why it's relevant

Linear algebra is magical and is one of the first maths where you can begin model those problems that may have seemed impossible to solve mathematically.  Problems like *"what should we watch on netflix tonight?"* or *"what social media posts would be most interesting?"* or *"how do i teach a computer how to read?"* or *"what words is this person probably typing on their phone?"*.  These are all problems that vigorously combine linear algebra and statistics.  Linear algebra provides the basis for linear regression, categorization, neural networks and the list goes on.  

Basically, if you don't understand linear algebra, you're not going have the slightest idea of what's possible with the giant trail of data you've created on the internet -- that's a compelling reason to learn it.  Learning linear algebra opens your mind to the possibilities of big data.  

Basically, instead of solving equations in two or three dimensions, you can now easily find solutions in problems that have hundreds or thousands of dimensions.  By combining these linear algebra techniques with statistics and other mathematical modeling techniques, computers can easily provide features and functionality that seem like science fiction if you don't know what is possible.  Forget about anticipating what will be possible, you're just along for the ride.  It's frightening to think that all these big data systems are only understood by tiny sliver of our population.  And even more so that this fraction of our population is so consumed by building this technological Tower of Babel that they don't have time to concern themselves with the ramifications.

### Statistics

**What it is:** Applied probability

**Where it's used:** Marketing, finance, insurance, game theory, big data, not getting pwn'd in life.

#### Why it's relevant

With statistics, you learn how to consider permutations and combinations, which is incredibly important when examining your options for solving problems and ensuring your solution is comprehensive.  You learn about distributions like the bell curve, which describes how far you can expect random variables deviate from the average.  Learning about windowing functions teaches you why shit that happened last week just ain't as important as what's happening now.  

The most important tool you'll pick up is the ability to model complex systems to make useful predictions.  You'll generally do this using Bayesian Networks and Markov Graphs or tools that build on those.  But in general, this will expand your ability to conceptualize problems.  You'll be able to discern what data is important and what doesn't affect the outcome.  

### Cryptography

**What it is:** Making sure you can't read my facebook messages

**Where it's used:** Your web browser

#### Why it's relevant

On the surface, you'll learn about network security protocols like TLS/SSL that are used in HTTPS.  In particular, you'll appreciate TLS 1.2 and you'll be skeptical of sites that are still using 1.0.  You'll be better able to infer whether that company's security claims are really trustworthy.  You'll understand how laughable internet security was before 2010, then you'll cry a little bit.  You'll appreciate how much network security has improved in the past two years.  You'll get angry when you hear that the NSA intentionally messed around with random number generators.  You'll know how to encrypt messages with PGP. 

Oh yeh .. that's all obscure technical shit that no one cares about. Hmmm ... what do you really gain from crypto? Like 5 IQ points. 

### Graph Theory

**What it is:** Solving problems based on graphs

**Where it's used:** DNA sequencing, data mining on social networks and impressing your relatives on that peg game at Cracker Barrel.

#### Why it's relevant

Learning graph theory will expand your ability to conceptualize and model problems.  That's kind of a theme here.  The kinds of problems that you encounter in graph theory are diverse, like identifying a eulerian path, which visits each node once.  Surprisingly, this problem shows up when sequencing DNA fragments.  You'll learn about various algorithms that can be used to solve specific problems in graph theory. 

### Functional Analysis
