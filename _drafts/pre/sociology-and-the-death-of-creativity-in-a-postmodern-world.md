- the psychological/sociological implications of a post-modern(?) world
  - title: the death of creativity in a post modern world
    - example: evolution of tv from 4 channels to dozens to the internet
      - loss of universal memes.
    - example: idioms and evolution of language
    - example: rodney mullen interview in bones brigade?
    - example: Ezra Pound's 1934 injunction to "Make it new!" (modernism)
    - metamodernism
  - decades ago, everyone was exposed to common cultural factors
    - there were a limited number of genre's of music
    - as more genre's of music were created and existing genres were recombinated
      - more subcultures evolved and our society became more culturally fragmented, psychologically 
    - memetically and epimemitcally, this changes how people are psychologically imprinted
      - this means that subcultures of people developed that shared much fewer universal psychological imprints
  - today, everything that has been done has been done before
    - all new genres of music/movies simply recominations of existing genre's and works
    - everything blurs together and nothing is pure.  nothing is original.
  - there are many means of communicating with, motivating, relating to, empathizing with and manipulating people
    - which only work when certain psychological imprints are (nearly) universally shared
    - what happens as our cultural artifacts become less pure and more diluted?
    - what happens as our cultural articifers (musicians, directors, poets, etc) and people in general
      - become more capable than ever of creating, but less capable of standing out 
        - or creating something wholly originally 
        - or creating something pure, which is less influenced by what's come before
    - communicating through symbols implied by art that is well-known to a subset of your audience
      - it's only possible to communicate with these symbols when both the symbols and their meaning are well-known
      - example playing "what it's like" on guitar at a party
  - there are some insights about creativity which can only be learned experientially
    - by being extremely creative in a particular field and truly pushing the boundaries
    - there are many insights which when learned firsthand through experience
      - will resonate through your being and facillitate a much greater change
      - than anyone could ever experience through the study of philosophy
    - begin with these insights about insights
  - so therefore, the death of creativity is very depressing indeed.
