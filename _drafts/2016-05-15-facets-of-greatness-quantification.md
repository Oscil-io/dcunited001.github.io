The past century and the next represent a really special time for
humanity.  We're witnessing modernization meld and mash the world's
cultures together, as the trends of globalization eroded away at our
physical and temporal barriers.  Three factors stand out: resource
availability, overpopulation and the exponential rate of
communication, eliminating time's constraint on the pace of
society. These factors will continue to define the first half of the
21st century as we accelerate toward the Singularity.

The socialogical implications of exponential development of technology
are more evident every day.  It is paramount that we understand how it
is changing our world, as tech is evolving.  To do this, we have to
quantify various aspects of technology.... .... this is off-topic for
an introduction.  yes, quantification is important for understanding
the singularity.


  - we need to understand where we are going.  as long as we move
    forward with this in mind, we'll be ok.
    - we need to figure out how to make technology "more human" or we
      risk losing touch with our humanity.
  - if we anticipate how society will change people ...
  - so we need to quantify behavior so we can measure it.  and we can
    anticipate our trajectory.



- Start out by talking a bit about modernization and how special our
  moment in history is.  It's like standing on the shoulders of
  giants and we're ready to launch out into space ... or something..
  - these few generations represent the culmination of human history, at
    least thus far.
  - There's a lot of talk about the Singularity, but I prefer to think
    about it more as Convergence.  We are definitely seeing
    exponential development of technology, but I think we'll
    eventually plateau with something more of a Sigmoid S-curve.
  - Regardless of where you think we're going, with our emminent
    liftoff towards exponential growth, we have to step back and
    examine our trajectory here.
    - It is paramount that we understand where we are going.
  - And we also need to understand how we arrived to where we are.
    How did we get to this momentus position?
    - And really, the answer is that we learned how to measure the
      world around us.
      - We even learned to measure cultural progress.
      - You can see that in the past 600 years, we clearly anticipated
        modernization because of how we prepared for it.  IMO,
        anyways, and I believe you can see some of the underpinnings
        for this stretch back even further. (might want to remove at
        least some of this..  speculative, lacks solid historic
        examples, and maybe not scientific..)

### Quantification

Perhaps one facet is more important than others.  It's hard to say and
while describing each facet, it seems that one is the crux.

they try to systematically and reproducibly measure everything they
can.
- the leaders of enterprise throughout history, but especially in the
  past century,
  - have excelled because they quantified things that others couldn't.
  - google led initial success in search because by developing a means of
    quantifying the websites that people referred to most.
- in other words, where others may have data they collect and things
  they measure,
  - great people will identify what others haven't thought to measure
    - and create methodologies for quantifying what others have
      thought impossible to measure.

### types of measurement



### history of measurement

- time, clocks, etc
  - time is perhaps the most important thing to measure
    - you basically can't organize the behavior of groups of any size,
      especially over long periods of time, if you can't measure time
  - measurement of astrological phenomena led to the development of
    various calendar systems
    - becoming familiar with the recurring nature of annual phenomena
      allowed the ruling class to make better decisions on the
      distribution of resources, the prioritization of work, etc.
    - in addition to being useful for coordinating resources and
      labor, propagating this knowledge through myth so that it was
      common knowledge for the masses was crucial for societal and
      cultural self-preservation
  - eventually we were able to measure the procession of time during
    the day to an unprecedented level of accuracy with the development
    of the water clock and eventually the mechanical clock.
    - before this, it was very difficult to measure much of anything
      with any level of accuracy and especially time.
      - it was very difficult to ensure that weights were actually
        standard between various regions and systems of measurement
        changed often to suit the interests of the ruling class,
        especially in the Dark Ages.
    - this essentially stemied any progress on science for an entire
      millenium
      - maths like calculus weren't necessary because, for the most
        part, without being able to accurately measure time, calculus
        is useless for the most part, in terms of practical
        applications.
      - other maths, like those based on set theory and especially
        statistics have always been incredibly useful. and have likely
        existed in various, nearly unrecognizeable forms throughout
        history, to varying degrees of completeness.
  - prevalence of awareness of time gradually propagated to the masses
    - how restriction of this allowed the ruling class to maintain
      power
  - by the 18th or 19th century, pocketwatches were much more
    prevelant, though still incredibly valuable

### Standard Oil

Standard Oil built an empire in the 19th century because they had a
better understanding of their market than their competitors. This is
what allowed them to grow into the dominant position they assumed at
the turn of the 20th century, regardless of how you feel about their
monopolistic tendancies.  That's off topic and I don't want it to
detract from my point: when there was an opportunity for a company
like Standard Oil to be created, they were able to make business
decisions based on the disparity of information and knowledge
available to them and their competitors.


Standard Oil had better information, thus they had better knowledge
and understanding about their market.  How did they acquire that
information?  Through communication and by understanding the data that
was important to collect and the information that was important to
process.  This is mostly opinion, as I don't actually know the
specifics of Standard Oil.  But how would they arrive at such an
understanding of the nature of competition in the late 19th century?
By measuring aspects of the 19th century oil market at that time that
their competitors didn't assess.  If they weren't collecting the right
data, they wouldn't have understood there was an opportunity there.
Or that the conditions of the oil market at that time would inevitably
lead to coalescence.

[examples of unexpected things to measure]
- geographic destribution of their competitors' customers
- market share of their competitors
- oil price trends
- range of viable oil prices for their competitors to offer
- cost of production and transportation for their product vs
  competitors

if you can't measure something, how can you say you know it?
knowledge is power, but if you can't quantify something -- a process,
a quality, etc. -- then how can you reliably reproduce it?  strategy
is useless if you don't know what the pieces are, how the fit together
or whether some piece of your strategy can be reliably executed when
you need it.

also important to quantify statistic variance and risk

this is especially important in an information economy.  relevant
information is based on quantifyable data and is processed to produce
knowledge.  if you can't quantify something or if you have collected
the wrong data, this can skew your organizations understanding ....

how can you say you improve year over year, if you don't measure the
right aspects of your business?

how can you say that your product is revolutionary, if you can't
provide numbers that show how revolutionary it is?

lead into communication:
- communication is a great example of something that seems difficult
  to measure
