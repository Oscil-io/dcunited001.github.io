###

This transition was destructive and creative at the same time,
isolating groups humans and psychologically imprinting them with
disaster, over and over again.  This disaster sparked a need to understand

It provided us with the impetus to culturally innovate to

### 8,000 BC - 5,000 BC

Lets be real, up to this point, humanity has been sticking to the
rivers and lakes that it's used to.  But that's all about to change.
Things are starting to heat up.

Lack of settlement means lack of sustained agriculture,
though. Because our food source is restricted to what we can find to
eat, this limits our population, as do many other factors.  Lack of
settlement means trade is sporadic at best and both of these factors
contribute to lack of cultural development.  Trade might be the single
most important factor incentivizing development of abstract written
communication, so that's right out too.

archetypes:
- sunken continent, lost civilization
- deluge/flood/disaster & vengeful god

### 5,000 BC

"the plan"
- collective unconscious strikes again

### 4,000 BC

development of the plan
- origins of metallurgy and whatnot

### 3,000 BC

back to harappa
- proto-anthropology

### 2,000 BC

paradise lost

break pre-history up into several periods:

- 8,000 BC
  - settlements in turkey (cayal hatuk)
  - melting glaciers providing an impetus for sea travel
  - ending with settlements in mesopotamia
- 5,000 BC

preface the article by defining how this is 'speculative history'
- state that it couldn't be true for the same reason that batman couldn't hang out with the xmen

previous disasters:
- cro magnon? neanderthal?

topics to mention:
- sicilian monolith
- bathymetry maps
  - how much of this should i cover?
- evolution of langauge through proto-anthropologists
- the indended purpose behind development of mythology
  - epic of gilgamesh (city vs country, city wins?)
- harrapans didn't seem to have war or much conflict at all

topics to research:
- extent & time period of sumerian civilization
  - established written law code around 1,800BC w/ hammurabi
- order of events in the bible
- epic of gilgamesh (plot, themes, timeline and inspiration from the early world)
- relationship b/w sumeria and harrapans
  - trading with sumerians as early as 3,500BC (from crash course video)

harrapan technology:
- some homes were connected to a centralized drainage system that used gravity to carry waste
- in mahenjo-daro, the largest building was a bathhouse
- they traded cotton cloth
- their way of life was dependent on a consistent flooding cycle (twice per year)
  - does this result from flooding from glaciation?
  - would they have been able to observe and predict a change in water flow from a melting glacier?
- did harrapans know about and observe climate change?

- personal beliefs on the transmission of culture throughout the world around 3,000 B.C.
  - that mostly lack evidence by the way
  - harappan civilization was created in the ancient world after the 'center' of the ancient world was identified
    - over the course of 1,000 years (starting ~4,000 B.C.) -- timeline is not too important here
      - after the cataclysm wiped out most of seaside human civilization
      - after the archetype of cataclysm wiping out human civilization was fresh in our minds
        - therefore we would have been determined to ensure it would not happen again
    - it is possible for humantity to unconsciously cooperate, even with limited communication
    - we would have spread culture and myth to 'advertise' this place
      - where great thinkers would go to develop technology
      - this could have occured through the development of myth over the course of 1,000-1,500 years
    - the 'center' of the world would have needed to be mostly known by this point
      - people understanding tradecraft would have understood that the 'center' of the world
        - would offer the most opportunity,
          - as that would have the greatest amount of aggregate human dispersion
        - this is only understandable after developing moderate maths
          - but still before developing widespread written language
            - there's a difference between written language and written communication
    - the most powerful information to have at this time would be geographic information
      - and accurate geographic information.
      - elements of mythology from this time should reflect this.
      - where are the most valuable resources?
        - how can we be sure? how many people know?
        - where does the land end?  does it ever?
        - how do we know where we are? how do we know where we should go? (the stars)
        - if the center is where the power is, how do we know where the center is?
    - and because multiple civilizations would be able to develop an understanding of:
      - (1) the center of the world being the most powerful and offering the most opportunity
      - (2) as well as the estimated direction towards the center
      - then with these two ideas these precivilizations could push emmisaries towards the center of the world
        - first, to establish communication networks with the rest of the world
        - second to accelerate the development of technology and culture
      - and most importantly, the more advanced minor precivilizations would do this unconsciously
        - and if they were wise enough to anticipate other culture's understanding of these ideas
          - they could do so with anticipation that others would be there to meet them in the center!
          - again, WITH NO COMMUNICATION.  based solely on metaphysics and wisdom.
  - so i believe this was the plan, spontaneously developed across the world after the pain of the cataclysm
    - after people had experienced the sum of antiquity
      - and the aggregate developments of their ancestry just simply vanish into nothingness
    - i believe this is what cultivated the desire of ancient civilizations
      -  to want to 'leave their mark' with monolithic archetecture
    - they had experienced the pain of losing everything
      - that pain transmuted itself into a universal archetype
    - and so, they pushed to find a way to ensure that it never happened again
      - while simultaneously understanding the problem of exponential growth and overpopulation
      - overpopulation and the cataclysm are two primative arche
        - from the dawn of humanity at the end of the ice age
        - these factor into our actions at a collective unconscious level
  - and so "the plan" was to develop human culture and technology to limit the suffering of the world
    - to limit the global trauma of overpopulation, while ensuring survival in the face of the next catastrophe
  - and so there are many cultural tools and treasures developed during the harappan civilization at the time
    - the civilization had plumbing and other amazing technologies.  basically the equivalent of rome
      - i wonder whether this civilization was planned in a region they knew would run out of water eventually
    - i believe that they vigorously studied linguistics that the time.
      - linguistics would have been fascinating.
      - to develop culture tools to ensure humanitys survival, they would have found linguistics invaluable.
      - they would have assessed the properties, pros and cons of various linguistic forms (SVO/SOV/VSO/etc)
    - and i believe it is here that we find the mystery of babel (and the mystery of the proto-indo-european)
      - all the world developed a universal language here.  it would have been invaluable to do so
        - therefore, all the languages began to come together into one
      - however, this unity invites advantage in developing discord.
        - accents and microdialects are developed in cities today
          - with the purpose of creating a system of communication that is difficult for others to understand
        - therefore, the unity of a universal language, invites the development of competing languages
      - so, one language was created, then other competing languages were subversively cultivated
        - here, you have would typically have many languages created at first,
        - then one of those languages would become superior and would become the prime competing language
    - this unified langauge wouldn't immediately be transmitted to the rest of the world of course,
      - but as the prime source of culture that impregnated the world, it's effect would be adumbrating
  - evidence of these lingual developments can be found in sanskrit
    - sankrit as a written language was specifically developed to capture nearly every possible human sound
      - there are 7 different vowels and 2 variations of each for a total of fourteen
      - the language elegantly handles digraphs/trigraphs and universally captures all of those sounds
    - i believe that the original harappan language vanished because of this
      - and this is mostly my prime basis for all these beliefs, which are mostly extensions of this
    - the harappans studied language more than anything else and developed this perfect universal language
      - captured in sanskrit. which could be used to capture and study other languages
      - to facilitate the development of the perfect language
  - however, out of the study of language in this civilization,
    - i believe another thing happened that would be missed by most
    - and this is that the particular advantages/disadvantages and the facets of each lingual structure
      - would have been vigorously studied by the intelligentsia of the time.  (making them more intelligent)
      - these people would have been incredibly wise.
    - and i believe they crafted a plan to resolve a debate on language/culture
      - and to provide humanity with cultural tools to recombine thousands of years later
        - that altogether these cultural tools would be far more powerful than any one would be alone
        - but that if any one of these were to absolutely rule over the others before we were ready
        - their descendents would end up creating a terrible homogenous world
      - and so they seeded regions of the earth with various forms of language and culture,
        - isolating them from having too much influence on each other
        - but still allowing adjacent cultures to merge and mix and combinate
      - they would have needed to know the extent of geography very well.
        - at least knowing the old world very, very well (and likely of the existance of the new world)
        - this would be greatly facilitated by the cultural apparatus that created harappa in the first place
          - as well as by the trade and commerce that helped it push forward
      - they would have picked the most basic, most primal elements of language and culture
        - they would have known that if they succeeded in rolling this plan out
          - that competition would keep civilizations in contained and none would gain too much superiority
      - i think they may have also decided to make their civilization vanish,
        - although i can't quite decide on why that is
  - this protocivilization would have also understood the problems of agriculture and resource limitations
    - and once the harappan civilization was doomed (by earthquake or whatever)
      - they would have been motivated to develop some kind of plan to avoid catastrophe

and this is where the story for the wise arch-mage came from
- who was born in an ancient, but doomed world
- and who divided a great magic into 7 forms to be spread to the corners of the earth
  - to be hidden in plain view until the world was ready
  - and until the world had a great need to unite these magic forms into one
  - which he knew would occur at the same time, the most critical time for our development
