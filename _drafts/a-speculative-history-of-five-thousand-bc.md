The importance of geography in the early world.
- surveying (especially elevation, during a chaotic time)
- astrology as a coordinate system for locating oneself
- mythology as a means of preserving knowledge
  - but also for fostering a purpose in a violent world with lots of suffering
  - and for cultivating trans-generational strategies for improving the human condition

Lets be real, up to this point, humanity has been sticking to the
rivers and lakes that it's used to.  But that's all about to change.
Things are starting to heat up.  Literally.

As I stated in the last article, this writing represents my personal
thoughts on human history from the Neolithic through the Bronze Age
and it shouldn't be take as fact.  It's titled "A Speculative History"
for a reason.  I hope to provide a good story and possibly spark your
interest.  If I do, follow up with some research yourself.

### Calamity Echoes Through Human Psyche

The Neolithic was fraught with changing weather patterns and
disaster. This continued through the late Neolithic, up through the
early Copper Age.  After 6,000 BC, the ice stopped melting and the
weather became a lot more stable.  When ice melts and land bridges are
broken, ocean currents and undersea brine rivers are disrupting,
forming new patterns which drive weather.  The changing weather causes
some areas to lose their appeal for settlement, forcing people to find
greener pastures.  Such was the case for the Sahara, which was mostly
green and arable through a long transition around 5,000 BC, finally
becoming the desert we know today.

Through the neolithic period, most of humanity was nomadic.  Lack of
settlement means lack of sustained agriculture, though. Because our
food source is restricted to what we can find to eat, this limits our
population, as do many other factors, such as regularly scheduled
catastrophic flooding.  Lack of settlement means trade is sporadic at
best and both of these factors contribute to stifled cultural
development.  Trade might be the single most important factor
incentivizing development of abstract written communication, so that's
right out too.  When you trade, you have to count things, write them
down and persist that information.

The humans that did settle would do so near the ocean, along rivers,
deltas and lakes.  They would find the easy access to water alluring
and so would animals, providing food.  However, these are the exact
areas subject to widespread destruction in flooding, which was often
seasonal, but sometimes devastating.  And these are just the exact
people who would be developing the basis of sophisticated
culture. During the period of 12,000 BC through 6,000 BC, there were
likely dozens of megafloods around the world, each wiping out between
5% and 50% of the population in that region.  If you experienced an
event like that and survived, you'd want to know why and you'd want to
find out how to prevent it from happening again.  Yet, these events
were relatively rare to the victim populations and only preserved
through myth.  It was difficult to understand the mechanism causing
flooding and if some group did, then it was difficult to propagate
that knowledge or discern a method to predict when one would happen.

However, that's not to say that we didn't understand what was going on
around us.  I believe that ancient humanity was well aware of rising
sea levels, since this is something they'd definitely be able to mark
and measure over the course of three or so generations.  At times, the
sea was rising at a rate of 10m every 300-500 years.  That's really
fast, for some areas.  People would notice --

> Oh shit, guys.  I think we're about to be on an island.  I don't
> think there's any way off of this thing.  Are you staying?  I'm
> peacin' out y'all.  Nevermind, too late.  There's not much food left
> here.  You think we can make somethin' that floats real good? I'm
> starving.

Boom. Seafare.

I really think that this ever-changing world created the conditions
that required humanity to innovate or perish.  By developing crude
seafare.

So you see, this transition was destructive and creative at the same
time, isolating groups of humans and psychologically imprinting us
with disaster, over and over again.  These disasters sparked a need to
conceptualize the world around us.  To understand, we developed means of
surveying the earth.  We developed an intense desire to understand
geography, everyone did.  It was already crucial for sustenance and
intriguing for self-discovery, but now it was important for survival.

We developed archeoastronomy, utilizing monoliths and smaller markers
to measure the motion of the stars, perhaps the only thing that ever
remained unquestionably constant.  As people had been migrating
throughout the ice age, the stars should have been well known for
navigation.  This would only become more systematized. Through the
Copper Age, it became apparent that understanding these phenomena
granted power and influence over others.  At some point, we reached a
critical mass of understanding, when cultural artifacts became more
valuable and useful for survival than anything tangible could be, in
itself.

This dynamic, deadly world of the Late Neolithic and Copper Age
provided us with the impetus for humanity to culturally innovate.  We
began to share information with other groups and more importantly, we
began to develop methodical strategies to share information more
efficiently and effectively.  And then, there was metallurgy, perhaps
the most important development until writing. In addition to being a
useful new technology, metallurgy paved way to creating resources
worth accumulating.

Excess of goods helped foster trade.  Trade incentivized cultural
exchange, the acquisition of new technologies, and conflict.  The
accelerating cultural exchange lead us to expand our lexicon: the set
of words and ideas we were aware of and could combine to form new
ideas. For the intelligent, commerce also provided motivation to
discover geography to locate the fastest and most trodden routes.
Trade quickly drove us to abstract the notion of value into money to
further accelerate commerce.  This was tightly related to metallurgy.
What else could be so valuable to anyone except Gold or Copper:
materials which should be equally useful to anyone with a hammer.

> It's shiny? I can bang it with a rock, loudly, till I get what ever
> I need? Gotta have it.  How long do I have to bang it?  Is it Gold?
> Never seent it. Is it copper?  Got tons of it. Good stuff.  Silver?
> Never heard of it. Lead? Raw? How hot do I have to burn it?

Trade and especially money drove us to create written language, with
which we could propagate ideas without speech and preserve traditions
or will, even beyond death.  Systematized forms of writing beyond art
were not developed until the end of Copper Age or the beginning of the
Bronze Age.

### Flooded regions.... TODO: fix title

Almost every culture has a story about a catastrophic flood that
nearly destroyed humanity. Many of these also feature a Noah figure,
whom they divine had influenced to craft an ark and preserve animal
life.  IMO, the animals moreso symbolize the preservation of culture
and knowledge here, whereas the ark symbolizes the preparation of a
small, but wise group of people.  In this world, these flooding events
were rare, especially regionally.

- But they were so destructive that no one would ever forget
  - and they developed these myths as a means to ensure that future generations would be prepared
  - many cultures would propagate these myths to adjacent cultures
- and here, i feel like the group symbolized by a Noah figure was prepared to deal with this
  - minor seismic events may have preceded previous events by weeks or months, if the flooding was glacial




### Doggerland


Countless myths concern lost cities, once great, but now sunken into
the sea or otherwise forgotten.

A developed
culture, usually fairly advanced that lay in the far north.  The
greeks called it Hyperborea.  Doggerland fits many of these myths.  It
was violently flooded by a tsunami triggered by a massive glacial
event called the Storegga Slide.





- knocked out by tsunami (Storegga Slide around 6200 BC)
  - this is probably not the only time a seaside glacier collapsed, triggering tsunami
  - however, the rest of the developing world was geographically shielded from tsunami's
    - generated by glacial collapse
    - the Mediterranean, definitely not at risk
    - nor would southern india
- flooding of the english channel
  - how would the Storegga Slide have affected this?
- original settlements in england/ireland?

### Lake Agassiz

- spread across canada, much larger than all five great lakes combined
  - fed by melting lake water, but unstable
  - excess freshwater accumulation caused glacial outburst floods
    - some of which refilled the great lakes
    - these would typically cool the northern hemisphere,
      - but increase the sea level
  - around 12,000 BC, it would drain northward when the glacial lake burst
  - started to drain southward when burst.
- around 6,200 BC, it burst for the last time
  - and sea levels may have risen dramatically in response
    - so it seems the sea level rose in bursts


### Black Sea Outburst Flood

There was possibly a major flood here in the 6th or 8th
millenium. It's known that the Black Sea was very recently completely
freshwater, with no connection through the Bosporus.  Another
explanation is that 8th millinium glacial flooding near the Caspian
diverted large amounts of freshwater into the Black Sea. The most
telltale sign of flooding from the Sea of Marmara would be diluvium
near the Bosporus, extending into and beyond the extent of the
original freshwater Black Sea.  Another key indicator could be
variations in mineral concentrations between regions of the originally
freshwater and seawater regions of the Black Sea.  One study, which
I'll reference soon, compared deposits of cellular life near the mouth
of the strait with those found on the seafloor.



IMO, it'd be very hard for the water to naturally breach the Bosporus
Strait when it was still an Isthmus.  Today the strait is only 17
miles long.  It averages 65m deep If this was a natural geological
feature, it should have cyclically flooded and reconnected several
times in the past million years.  It is not likely that it would have
only once occured naturally in recent geological history.  And thus,
the Bosporus Strait should exhibit evidence of a geological structure
that has flooded multiple times.  As thin as the Bosporus Isthmus
would have been, it would be more likely to flood in multiple places
if it flooded multiple times.  This could be another indication of
whether the even happened multiple times.

Perhaps an earthquake in or around the Bosporus weakened the soil
there or somehow otherwise opened.

- earthquake in, near bosphorus? the marmara fault runs through it.
  - possible tsunami that weakened the soil there?
  - sea of marmara was landlocked up to 4000 BC


One last observation is the presence of an underwater brine river in
the Black Sea, originating from the Bosporus Strait and flowing into
the Black Sea, forming what would be the worlds 6th largest river by
volume.  Looking at the depth maps of the Marmara Sea, the Bosporus
and the Black Sea, this seems strange at first.  The Bosporus is 65m
deep on average.  Why would cold water flow up to 65 meters from a
depth of +1000m and into the Black Sea.  On further reading, there is
a warm current flowing in the opposite direction from the Black Sea
into the Marmara.  This current likely draws cold, salty water up
by convection as it enters the Marmara.




transition from outburst floods

IMO, this one can't be conclusively shown to be, from my amateur take
after some reading. I want it to be true because it might explain a lot.
And there were definitely ancient peoples in the area,

... rewrite that ^^^

... and maybe get rid of this vvvv

using google maps, i can see the effect of erosion from an ancient danube riverbed
- there doesn't seem to be much undersea erosion around the rest of the black sea
  - except for the area leading from the Bosporus strait
- at least, i think.  i don't know what i'm looking for and the data is horribly blurred
  - also, i should see this erosion closer to the source, the Bosporus
  - however, i really think if there were a recent outburst flood,
    - there should be diluvian erosion patterns here

- this is definitely way on the pseudoscience end, but ...
  - the Bosporus Strait is only 17 miles long and averages at 65m deep
    - i'm not really sure what tools it would take to use.  this is the major issue.
    - but if there were tools available, they could have started from them middle
      - or really just dug outward
  - would it be impossible for this to have been one of the first engineering projects?
    - for comparison, the Suez canal is 120 miles long
    - the Panama canal is 50 miles long
  - there were even ancient canal projects:
    - many roman canal projects were of similar depth and breadth
    - canal of the pharoahs: over 50 miles long
      - i'll admit, the wiki page is a bit questionable
      - it doesn't really address whether or not the project was every completed
  - and i can tell, i'm really just trying to make this work,
    - although, turkey and the areas surrounding really was the center of civilization
- but it also matches up with sections from the Gilgamesh and Sumerian flood myths,
  - stating that the gods conspired to cause the flood
  - however, these myths were definitely centered around the Persian Gulf
    - and around Dilmun in particular, which seems to have occupied Bahrain and
      the area beyond Shatt-al-Arab river, the Ur-Schatt river basin in the ancient Persian Gulf

### Dilmun and the Ancient Persian Gulf River Basin

include pics from Kurt Lambeck paper (1995)
- "Shoreline reconstructions for the Persian Gulf since the last glacial maximum"

flooding of the Persian gulf during this time
- probably happened at least once as an unexpected catastrophe
  - then again, periodically every few hundred years
  - these repeated experiences would have been catastrophic to early civilization
  - the pain of losing everything would have been seared into our psyche
    - IMO, this pain served as an impetus to build monolithic works
      - if the work was big enough it would not be lost to catastrophe
      - or disassembled by invaders
    - by building these works, ancient leaders hoped that their culture
      - would never again be completely lost
      - thus the origin behind the search for immortality by Egyptians
- the response to flooding of the Persian gulf
  - during this time, the Tigris & Euphrates would have flowed into Persian Gulf area
    - possibly merging before/around reaching the area now known as Kuwait
    - thus, the fertile crescent before 5,000 BC would have been nearly twice as large
    - and the closest area to the Persian Gulf would have been the most attractive place to live, there
      - this is because it becomes the most ideal port connecting the entire Fertile Cresent river basin
  - people would have been split into at least three groups following the catastrophe(s)
    - people would follow the region along the coast of Iran up towards the Indus Valley
      - these people would eventually found Harrapa, the Indus Valley Civilization (ICV)
    - another group of people would retreat, again and again, further up the Persian Gulf
      - as water repeatedly destroyed coastal civilizations.
      - the changing coastline would become noticeable and would visibly move
        - these changes would occur over the course of two to three generations
        - and measuring these changes would require marking the coastline
          - likely using large stone objects
          - these are also useful as constants for marking/measuring objects in the skyline
    - this group of people would follow the changing Tigris/Euphrates delta
  - a third group would begin occupying higher and higher ground
    - along the coastline from Kuwait to Oman to Yemen

sumerian creation myth (1600 BC)

- babylonians tracked jupiter with sophisticated geometrical math
  - http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/babylonians-tracked-jupiter-with-sophisticated-geometrical-math/
  - Used geometry that hints at calculus 1,500 years before Europeans.


development of mythology
- gilgamesh



writing in dilmun?  probably not
- dilmun was partially submerged by 8000 BC and mostly submerged by 6000 BC.
  - because of writing's viral nature, it would have quickly escaped if it was developed in Dilmun
- there's a 4000 year space between the time when Dilmun would have been in it's heyday
  - and when Sumeria first started developing it's writing

writing in Sumeria (4000 BC)
- we only have proof of writing back to 4000 BC in Sumeria.
  - however, the first samples of writing are almost entirely comprised of financial records of transactions
    - and inventories of agricultural products.
- but IMO, there was writing in the area before people thought to produce clay tablets.
  - it was part of developing further abstract ideas, but we only have evidence of it
    from when people decided to start firing clay tablets.
  - speaking of which, that whole process seems cumbersome.
    - i don't think everyone had a kiln or means of creating these tablets.
    - they must have been required for some purpose
      - or at least strongly encouraged by some part of their culture
      - perhaps by the introduction of taxes
    - but if not everyone had a kiln, the inhabitants likely developed processes
      - for producing these in some systematic, more efficient way.
    - if you don't own a kiln, but you happen to be rich enough to need to tabulate inventory
      - or record a transaction, the it's basically like going to kinko's every time you need to print something
- these systems likely originated in a similar fashion to language.
  - and it's related to the humans abstracting concepts using art
  - the more common that became, the more people would communicate with art
  - as they communicated with art, particular symbols and styles would emerge to represent similar ideas
- however, they wouldn't be writing in a way that left a permanent trace,
  - that is, until the sumerians started keeping financial records.


### 8,000 BC - 5,000 BC

(from the end of the neolithic to the beginning of the copper age)


sahara climate change
- from 8000 BC to 5000 BC

4 areas with flooding disaster
- doggerland
- black sea
- persian gulf
- ??


break pre-history up into several periods:

- 8,000 BC
  - settlements in turkey (cayal hatuk)
  - melting glaciers providing an impetus for sea travel
  - ending with settlements in mesopotamia
- 5,000 BC


archetypes:
- sunken continent, lost civilization
- deluge/flood/disaster & vengeful god

human conflict:
- doesn't seem common until the bronze age
  - because killing someone is inefficient and grotesque without metallic weapons
    - have you ever thought about how painful it would be to kill someone with a rock?
      - that would suck
    - i guess you could use a spear or something, but still.  inefficient
      - you really gotta hit the guy multiple times.
        - what if he breaks your wooden spear.  just snaps it in half?
      - or what if his spear is bigger?
    - really, at this point in time, killing people is hard
      - and like most other things, people just aren't very good at it yet
  - without money and controlled trade and accumulated resources,
    - there is no significant financial benefit to doing so
      - what are you going to do?  murder Abel and take his sticks?
    - as technology increases, so do accumulated resources
      - for neolithic through bronze age civs,
        - metallic resources can be reprocessed and repurposed
    - without accumulated resources, trade and money, there are no taxes
    - without taxes, there is no dedicated government of any respectable size
    - with no taxes and no government,
      - it's really hard to systematically coordinate a population to start war
    - a war of any scale means a significant portion of men leaving the fields
      - this is a significant problem for societies with low population
  - out of control populations are not as much of a problem
    - neither is resource over-consumption
  - and don't get me wrong, i'm sure there was some conflict,
    - but that it was localized conflict
      - and for the most part, it wasn't organized beyond perhaps a few dozen people

religion
- without widespread religion there are no ideological causes for warfare
    - and again, without the cultural infrastructure to spread religion
      - and without a class of people who can afford to hang out and tend to religious affairs
    - there is no way for organized religion to spread,
      - nor is there really any cultural apparatus to enforce religious beliefs
    - so, there was no widespread religion,
      - and similar to the fluid nature of language discuss in part one
      - religions were 'ephemeral.' that is, they came and went.  they were moreso tribal.
      - it was only when one belief system conferred significant evolutionary advantage that it took off
        - and i mean informational evolutionary advantage, not genetic.
        - this means that the belief system had significant growth vectors
          - AND more importantly, it offered the adherents so advantage
        - that is, there was some significant demonstrative or believable value in adhering to this system
- but religion quickly enters the picture,
  - as people witness more and more phenomena they can't explain, they seek explanation
  - and the people who can explain, especially those who can harness said inexplicable phenomena
    - begin to enjoy their newfound power
    - it is at this point that some people begin to realize just how stupid other people are
    - this shaman or priest class begins to understand that it doesn't just matter how they explain things
      - or whether the explanations are even true at all
      - it turns out, for the most part,
        - the only thing that matters is whether people believe their explanations
    - at this point, the priest class begins to separate itself from the rest of society

- the knowledge of good and evil
  - this is not simply the knowledge of the existance of good and the existence of evil
    - neither is it really the loss of our innocence, per se.
  - the knowledge of good and evil is the knowledge of *how to use* **good** and **how to use** *evil*
    - in order to accomplish one's goals.
    - especially in the sense that one becomes aware of how others will perceive an action
  - the more abstract our knowledge of the world grew,
    - the more that abstract knowledge could be used to confer one an advantage over others for good or ill
  - fairly quickly on, those with significant knowledge began to understand
    - just how powerful both knowledge and information were.
    - so they learned to horde it.
      - that anything leaking from the priest or ruling class was incredibly dangerous to themselves
    - these same people feared technological innovations,
      - because they understood how to control the status quo

black sea settlements? research
- apparently a glacial deluge here?  it's a hypothesis, but i think a reasonable one

Copper Age
- anatolia
- cultures began to be capable of processing copper
  - bronze requires copper & tin
  - tin was scarce originally? why?
- vinca culture (early: 5700 BC - 4800 BC, late: 4800 BC - 4200 BC)
  - tartaria tablets (containing vinca symbols),
- timna valley, in southern isreal, shows evidence of copper mining dating back to between 7,000 BC to 5,000 BC
- Bhirrana, the oldest ICV site (dating back to 7500-6200 BC)



Bronze Age
- Troy I founded in 3,000 BC

- sunken monolith discovered at ~50m near sicily in August 2015
  - how much work is being done to explore sites like this?
  - is it possible to do something like LIDAR for underwater surveys
    - that are under less than 100m seawater?
- dilmun, a lost civilization located near Bahrain and mentioned in Gilgamesh
- we can see the cultural legacy of sumerian cuneiform in other mesotopian languages
  - but why is it that the harrapan language just disappeared without any real cultural legacy,
    - especially with their language?


recent genetic work have shown that
- a "mixture" of Indo-Aryans and Dravidians began circa 2200 B.C. and ended around 100 A.D
- recent ars technica article?


### 5,000 BC

by this time, civilization was well established in parts of the indus valley
- it likely wasn't anything like the technologically advanced ICV around 3000 BC

"the plan"
- collective unconscious strikes again
- development of systematized means of accelerating the development of culture
  - by identifying the conditions that allow society to study and develop knowledge
    - stability, tradition, virtues, ...
    - a healthy economy
  - then identifying a geographically shielded location close to the center of the world
- establishment of systems of self-preservation for this culture
  - no one leaves, unless authorizes

## Part 3


preface the article by defining how this is 'speculative history'
- state that it couldn't be true
  - for the same reason that batman couldn't hang out with the xmen
  - save for part 3



### 4,000 BC

origins of metallurgy and whatnot
- metallurgy furthers the sense of the self
- the importance of metallurgy in developing abstract ideas and art
  - joke about "mobile" art app
- how hot can we make fire?
  - melting various metals as a measure of heat and to quantify energy
  - knowledge of energy contained within sources
    - availability/scarcity of materials with significant levels of energy

- sicilian monolith
- bathymetry maps
  - how much of this should i cover?
- evolution of langauge through proto-anthropologists
- the indended purpose behind development of mythology
  - epic of gilgamesh (city vs country, city wins?)
- harrapans didn't seem to have war or much conflict at all

topics to research:
- extent & time period of sumerian civilization
  - established written law code around 1,800BC w/ hammurabi
- order of events in the bible
- epic of gilgamesh (plot, themes, timeline and inspiration from the early world)
- relationship b/w sumeria and harrapans
  - trading with sumerians as early as 3,500BC (from crash course
    video)

the harrapan culture that created "the plan":
- a segment of harrapan culture in the himalayan steppes
  - close to the mouth of the indus river
  - a civilization that witnessed many of their neighbors' societies
    perish in floods, leaving no trace
- this society become wise enough to understand the cause of the
  floods.  they knew that the causes behind them would not last
  forever
  - they identified a location that would provide water and sustenance
    but was mostly guarded from flooding damage
    - they intentionally picked a place that was high in the mountains
      because it would be nearly impossible to invade.
    - thus, their culture and the cultures they studied and protected
      would be shielded from the chaos of warfare
  - from here, they developed a plan to prevent such widespread loss
    of culture. to them, nothing was more tragic than the
    disappearance of culture.  nothing, except the subversion of it.
    - was their choice to disappear a response to subversion by
      conquerors?
    - or was it because they were afraid that knowledge of their
      society would lead back to knowledge they were trying to protect
      the world against? i.e. leading humanity to a premature
      discovery of 'the plan' or of forbidden maths.
  . also, from here, high up in the world, they observed cultures rise
      and fall, languages grew and subsided while their culture
      persisted
  - they also understood the curse of overpopulation and, by learning
    the highest of maths, they understood the inevitable progression
    of technology into artificial intelligence.
    - this insight was accessible since well before the first
      mechanical computers.  all that is necessary is the knowledge
      that it is possible for a machine or even a system to be created
      in the image of man's mind.
    - from their wisdom, knowing this and knowing the heart of man,
      they determined that the development of such an artificial mind
      could lead to utopia or to the enslavement of mankind
- and to protect against overpopulation, they determined that
  disasters early in man's history would be more effective in staving
  off the dangers of overpopulation
  - should i continue describing this aspect of overpopulation?  it's
    pretty fucking grim. nothing good would come of people knowing the
    truth
- anyways, the development of a plan to ensure the survival of mankind
  began. it became known to them ....
  - they developed protocols to be preserved unconsciously through
    mythology
    - protocols for propagating information back to 'the origin,'
      though the origin was hardly intended to be a physical place

harrapan technology:
- some homes were connected to a centralized drainage system that used gravity to carry waste
- in mahenjo-daro, the largest building was a bathhouse
- they traded cotton cloth
- their way of life was dependent on a consistent flooding cycle (twice per year)
  - does this result from flooding from glaciation?
  - would they have been able to observe and predict a change in water flow from a melting glacier?
- did harrapans know about and observe climate change?

- personal beliefs on the transmission of culture throughout the world around 3,000 B.C.
  - that mostly lack evidence by the way
  - harappan civilization was created in the ancient world after the 'center' of the ancient world was identified
    - over the course of 1,000 years (starting ~4,000 B.C.) -- timeline is not too important here
      - after the cataclysm wiped out most of seaside human civilization
      - after the archetype of cataclysm wiping out human civilization was fresh in our minds
        - therefore we would have been determined to ensure it would not happen again
    - it is possible for humantity to unconsciously cooperate, even with limited communication
    - we would have spread culture and myth to 'advertise' this place
      - where great thinkers would go to develop technology
      - this could have occured through the development of myth over the course of 1,000-1,500 years
    - the 'center' of the world would have needed to be mostly known by this point
      - people understanding tradecraft would have understood that the 'center' of the world
        - would offer the most opportunity,
          - as that would have the greatest amount of aggregate human dispersion
        - this is only understandable after developing moderate maths
          - but still before developing widespread written language
            - there's a difference between written language and written communication
    - the most powerful information to have at this time would be geographic information
      - and accurate geographic information.
      - elements of mythology from this time should reflect this.
      - where are the most valuable resources?
        - how can we be sure? how many people know?
        - where does the land end?  does it ever?
        - how do we know where we are? how do we know where we should go? (the stars)
        - if the center is where the power is, how do we know where the center is?
    - and because multiple civilizations would be able to develop an understanding of:
      - (1) the center of the world being the most powerful and offering the most opportunity
      - (2) as well as the estimated direction towards the center
      - then with these two ideas these precivilizations could push emmisaries towards the center of the world
        - first, to establish communication networks with the rest of the world
        - second to accelerate the development of technology and culture
      - and most importantly, the more advanced minor precivilizations would do this unconsciously
        - and if they were wise enough to anticipate other culture's understanding of these ideas
          - they could do so with anticipation that others would be there to meet them in the center!
          - again, WITH NO COMMUNICATION.  based solely on metaphysics and wisdom.
  - so i believe this was the plan, spontaneously developed across the world after the pain of the cataclysm
    - after people had experienced the sum of antiquity
      - and the aggregate developments of their ancestry just simply vanish into nothingness
    - i believe this is what cultivated the desire of ancient civilizations
      -  to want to 'leave their mark' with monolithic archetecture
    - they had experienced the pain of losing everything
      - that pain transmuted itself into a universal archetype
    - and so, they pushed to find a way to ensure that it never happened again
      - while simultaneously understanding the problem of exponential growth and overpopulation
      - overpopulation and the cataclysm are two primative arche
        - from the dawn of humanity at the end of the ice age
        - these factor into our actions at a collective unconscious level
  - and so "the plan" was to develop human culture and technology to limit the suffering of the world
    - to limit the global trauma of overpopulation, while ensuring survival in the face of the next catastrophe
  - and so there are many cultural tools and treasures developed during the harappan civilization at the time
    - the civilization had plumbing and other amazing technologies.  basically the equivalent of rome
      - i wonder whether this civilization was planned in a region they knew would run out of water eventually
    - i believe that they vigorously studied linguistics that the time.
      - linguistics would have been fascinating.
      - to develop culture tools to ensure humanitys survival, they would have found linguistics invaluable.
      - they would have assessed the properties, pros and cons of various linguistic forms (SVO/SOV/VSO/etc)
    - and i believe it is here that we find the mystery of babel (and the mystery of the proto-indo-european)
      - all the world developed a universal language here.  it would have been invaluable to do so
        - therefore, all the languages began to come together into one
      - however, this unity invites advantage in developing discord.
        - accents and microdialects are developed in cities today
          - with the purpose of creating a system of communication that is difficult for others to understand
        - therefore, the unity of a universal language, invites the development of competing languages
      - so, one language was created, then other competing languages were subversively cultivated
        - here, you have would typically have many languages created at first,
        - then one of those languages would become superior and would become the prime competing language
    - this unified langauge wouldn't immediately be transmitted to the rest of the world of course,
      - but as the prime source of culture that impregnated the world, it's effect would be adumbrating
  - evidence of these lingual developments can be found in sanskrit
    - sankrit as a written language was specifically developed to capture nearly every possible human sound
      - there are 7 different vowels and 2 variations of each for a total of fourteen
      - the language elegantly handles digraphs/trigraphs and universally captures all of those sounds
    - i believe that the original harappan language vanished because of this
      - and this is mostly my prime basis for all these beliefs, which are mostly extensions of this
    - the harappans studied language more than anything else and developed this perfect universal language
      - captured in sanskrit. which could be used to capture and study other languages
      - to facilitate the development of the perfect language
  - however, out of the study of language in this civilization,
    - i believe another thing happened that would be missed by most
    - and this is that the particular advantages/disadvantages and the facets of each lingual structure
      - would have been vigorously studied by the intelligentsia of the time.  (making them more intelligent)
      - these people would have been incredibly wise.
    - and i believe they crafted a plan to resolve a debate on language/culture
      - and to provide humanity with cultural tools to recombine thousands of years later
        - that altogether these cultural tools would be far more powerful than any one would be alone
        - but that if any one of these were to absolutely rule over the others before we were ready
        - their descendents would end up creating a terrible homogenous world
      - and so they seeded regions of the earth with various forms of language and culture,
        - isolating them from having too much influence on each other
        - but still allowing adjacent cultures to merge and mix and combinate
      - they would have needed to know the extent of geography very well.
        - at least knowing the old world very, very well (and likely of the existance of the new world)
        - this would be greatly facilitated by the cultural apparatus that created harappa in the first place
          - as well as by the trade and commerce that helped it push forward
      - they would have picked the most basic, most primal elements of language and culture
        - they would have known that if they succeeded in rolling this plan out
          - that competition would keep civilizations in contained and none would gain too much superiority
      - i think they may have also decided to make their civilization vanish,
        - although i can't quite decide on why that is
  - this protocivilization would have also understood the problems of agriculture and resource limitations
    - and once the harappan civilization was doomed (by earthquake or whatever)
      - they would have been motivated to develop some kind of plan to avoid catastrophe

and this is where the story for the wise arch-mage came from
- who was born in an ancient, but doomed world
- and who divided a great magic into 7 forms to be spread to the corners of the earth
  - to be hidden in plain view until the world was ready
  - and until the world had a great need to unite these magic forms into one
  - which he knew would occur at the same time, the most critical time for our development
