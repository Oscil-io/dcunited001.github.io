So, I'm going to write this article a little earlier than I should
because it touches on so many ideas I find fascinating, especially
linguistics and early civilization.  It's important to understand
that what I'm postulating here is far from fact and is at best
an amalgamation of many good ideas, a few of which might actually
be valid. That's why I'm going to preface this as speculative
history or just fiction really.  But it still has all the elements
of a great story.

I believe that among other great ideas, I might have found a clue to
the origins of the proto-indo-european language:
proto-anthropologists.  I need to explain some things at a high level,
then dive into some details.  I won't neglect the occasional collapsed
civilization and catastrophic disasters, nor the archetypes accumulated in
humanity's collective unconsciousness.

### War and Peace

The two earliest major civilizations in our world were the Sumerians
of the Mesopotamian and the Harrapans of the Indus Valley, which were
only recently discovered in the 20th century.  One was plagued by
warfare and the other vanished after being blessed by peace.

The Sumerian and Harrapan civilizations breifly coexisted, around
3,000 BC and undoubtedly knew of each other. There was significant
trade.  In fact, until the discovery of Harrapan cities, the only
evidence we had were artifacts found in Sumerian cities.  At that
point, we weren't aware of the Indus Valley Civilization (ICV.)

### Sumeria

Sumeria is known for its ziggurats, it's cities, for fostering
agriculture and, most famously, the first system of written language.
It's also the *first known* major civilization in the world. I provide
a compelling argument to explain why Sumeria may not be the first
Mesopotamian civilization later on.

Sumeria also occupied the most valuable piece of real estate the world
has ever known.  This is what fueled the conflict for so long in the
middle east, which was blessed and cursed by geography.  The middle
east brings inlets of water in which connect it to the Horn of Africa,
the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea
and to the far east.  The middle east was and is the *literal center
of the world.*

The fastest way to travel *and trade* in the old world?  Seafare.  The
fastest way to meet the most people?  The fastest way to accumulate
knowledge?  The fastest way to collect the most taxes?  The fastest
way to conduct the most business with the most people?  Sit in the
center of the world.  Identify this with a bit of geography, find a
way to occupy it and regulate commerce and you're set for generations.
It is this power that people have been fighting over for millennia.

### Harrapa

Harrapa is famous as a technologically advanced civilization that
vanished, only recently rediscovered in the last century, whose
language we are still struggling to translate.  Their technology was
amazing for a civilization from 5,000 to 6,000 years in the past.

Some Harrapan cities had systems of plumbing, where houses were
connected with piping to carry away waste.  They had toilets.  5,000
years ago. Imagine the knowledge that requires to engineer that.  With
no precedent established from prior civilizations?  If you're going to
construct a sewage system, of any capacity or quality, that doesn't
just require technology, an understanding of physics, and a modest
understanding of fluid dynamics.

It requires forethought! You really can't build on top of existing
settlement infrastructure for a major project like that.  You've
really got to step back and plan where a good spot for a city would
be, which would offer the ideal setting for gravity to push water
through a system like that.  And which would not be subject to
erosion, that would be a waste.

My point here is fourfold.  First, this implies that the Harrapans
were experimenting with this stuff for a long time at a small scale
before implementing larger, more permanent systems.  The lessons
learned to construct lasting civil infrastructure take *generations*.
Secondly, simply having the incentive to build systems like this - it
implies long-term stability and lack of chaotic change.  Otherwise,
a society would simply never think about doing this stuff.  It just
wouldn't even occur to them and it certainly wouldn't be a priority.

Third, these efforts take long-term multi-generational cooperation,
which may also imply longer lifespans. The Harrapans basically never
knew warfare, which may have been their downfall.  So they obviously
weren't forcing anyone to build this stuff.  They didn't seem to spend
all their money building temples either.

And finally, building cities to this degree of craftsmanship,
including other feats such as multi-story buildings, requires
cultivating systems of understanding, measurement and knowledge
propagation.  They obviously valued knowledge, intelligence and
wisdom.

It's these observations, among others, that lead me to believe these
people had a kind of academic class.  They seemed to understand that
the could improve their lives through technology.  To the point that
the pursuit of technology itself was immensely valuable.

The Sumerians and so many others after them realized the value of
technology too. Yet, their lust for power caused the ruling class to
attempt to horde it for themselves when it was useful and stifle its
development when it threatened whatever good thing they had goin' on
at the time.

But why?  Why the contrast here?  Why did the two civilizations have
completely different perspectives on the phenomena of knowledge, the
development of technology and the release of humanity from the
constraints of nature?  Whereas it appears Harrapa sought to free man
from the suffering and chaos of nature for the benefit of everyone,
Sumeria sought to use technology to construct monoliths and towering
empires.


harrapans
- unknown language
-

the importance of geography in the early world
- astrology as a coordinate system for locating oneself
- mythology as a means of preserving knowledge
  - but also for fostering a purpose in a violent world with lots of suffering
  - and for cultivating trans-generational strategies for improving the human condition


break pre-history up into several periods:

- 12,000 BC
- 8,000 BC
  - settlements in turkey (cayal hatuk)
- 6,000 BC
  - settlements in mesopotamia
- 5,000 BC

preface the article by defining how this is 'speculative history'
- state that it couldn't be true for the same reason that batman couldn't hang out with the xmen


topics to mention:
- sicilian monolith
- bathymetry maps
  - how much of this should i cover?
- evolution of langauge through proto-anthropologists
- the indended purpose behind development of mythology
  - epic of gilgamesh (city vs country, city wins?)
- harrapans didn't seem to have war or much conflict at all

topics to research:
- extent & time period of sumerian civilization
  - established written law code around 1,800BC w/ hammurabi
- order of events in the bible
- epic of gilgamesh (plot, themes, timeline and inspiration from the early world)
- relationship b/w sumeria and harrapans
  - trading with sumerians as early as 3,500BC (from crash course video)

harrapan technology:
- some homes were connected to a centralized drainage system that used gravity to carry waste
- in mahenjo-daro, the largest building was a bathhouse
- they traded cotton cloth

- personal beliefs on the transmission of culture throughout the world around 3,000 B.C.
  - that mostly lack evidence by the way
  - harappan civilization was created in the ancient world after the 'center' of the ancient world was identified
    - over the course of 1,000 years (starting ~4,000 B.C.) -- timeline is not too important here
      - after the cataclysm wiped out most of seaside human civilization
      - after the archetype of cataclysm wiping out human civilization was fresh in our minds
        - therefore we would have been determined to ensure it would not happen again
    - it is possible for humantity to unconsciously cooperate, even with limited communication
    - we would have spread culture and myth to 'advertise' this place
      - where great thinkers would go to develop technology
      - this could have occured through the development of myth over the course of 1,000-1,500 years
    - the 'center' of the world would have needed to be mostly known by this point
      - people understanding tradecraft would have understood that the 'center' of the world
        - would offer the most opportunity,
          - as that would have the greatest amount of aggregate human dispersion
        - this is only understandable after developing moderate maths
          - but still before developing widespread written language
            - there's a difference between written language and written communication
    - the most powerful information to have at this time would be geographic information
      - and accurate geographic information.
      - elements of mythology from this time should reflect this.
      - where are the most valuable resources?
        - how can we be sure? how many people know?
        - where does the land end?  does it ever?
        - how do we know where we are? how do we know where we should go? (the stars)
        - if the center is where the power is, how do we know where the center is?
    - and because multiple civilizations would be able to develop an understanding of:
      - (1) the center of the world being the most powerful and offering the most opportunity
      - (2) as well as the estimated direction towards the center
      - then with these two ideas these precivilizations could push emmisaries towards the center of the world
        - first, to establish communication networks with the rest of the world
        - second to accelerate the development of technology and culture
      - and most importantly, the more advanced minor precivilizations would do this unconsciously
        - and if they were wise enough to anticipate other culture's understanding of these ideas
          - they could do so with anticipation that others would be there to meet them in the center!
          - again, WITH NO COMMUNICATION.  based solely on metaphysics and wisdom.
  - so i believe this was the plan, spontaneously developed across the world after the pain of the cataclysm
    - after people had experienced the sum of antiquity
      - and the aggregate developments of their ancestry just simply vanish into nothingness
    - i believe this is what cultivated the desire of ancient civilizations
      -  to want to 'leave their mark' with monolithic archetecture
    - they had experienced the pain of losing everything
      - that pain transmuted itself into a universal archetype
    - and so, they pushed to find a way to ensure that it never happened again
      - while simultaneously understanding the problem of exponential growth and overpopulation
      - overpopulation and the cataclysm are two primative arche
        - from the dawn of humanity at the end of the ice age
        - these factor into our actions at a collective unconscious level
  - and so "the plan" was to develop human culture and technology to limit the suffering of the world
    - to limit the global trauma of overpopulation, while ensuring survival in the face of the next catastrophe
  - and so there are many cultural tools and treasures developed during the harappan civilization at the time
    - the civilization had plumbing and other amazing technologies.  basically the equivalent of rome
      - i wonder whether this civilization was planned in a region they knew would run out of water eventually
    - i believe that they vigorously studied linguistics that the time.
      - linguistics would have been fascinating.
      - to develop culture tools to ensure humanitys survival, they would have found linguistics invaluable.
      - they would have assessed the properties, pros and cons of various linguistic forms (SVO/SOV/VSO/etc)
    - and i believe it is here that we find the mystery of babel (and the mystery of the proto-indo-european)
      - all the world developed a universal language here.  it would have been invaluable to do so
        - therefore, all the languages began to come together into one
      - however, this unity invites advantage in developing discord.
        - accents and microdialects are developed in cities today
          - with the purpose of creating a system of communication that is difficult for others to understand
        - therefore, the unity of a universal language, invites the development of competing languages
      - so, one language was created, then other competing languages were subversively cultivated
        - here, you have would typically have many languages created at first,
        - then one of those languages would become superior and would become the prime competing language
    - this unified langauge wouldn't immediately be transmitted to the rest of the world of course,
      - but as the prime source of culture that impregnated the world, it's effect would be adumbrating
  - evidence of these lingual developments can be found in sanskrit
    - sankrit as a written language was specifically developed to capture nearly every possible human sound
      - there are 7 different vowels and 2 variations of each for a total of fourteen
      - the language elegantly handles digraphs/trigraphs and universally captures all of those sounds
    - i believe that the original harappan language vanished because of this
      - and this is mostly my prime basis for all these beliefs, which are mostly extensions of this
    - the harappans studied language more than anything else and developed this perfect universal language
      - captured in sanskrit. which could be used to capture and study other languages
      - to facilitate the development of the perfect language
  - however, out of the study of language in this civilization,
    - i believe another thing happened that would be missed by most
    - and this is that the particular advantages/disadvantages and the facets of each lingual structure
      - would have been vigorously studied by the intelligentsia of the time.  (making them more intelligent)
      - these people would have been incredibly wise.
    - and i believe they crafted a plan to resolve a debate on language/culture
      - and to provide humanity with cultural tools to recombine thousands of years later
        - that altogether these cultural tools would be far more powerful than any one would be alone
        - but that if any one of these were to absolutely rule over the others before we were ready
        - their descendents would end up creating a terrible homogenous world
      - and so they seeded regions of the earth with various forms of language and culture,
        - isolating them from having too much influence on each other
        - but still allowing adjacent cultures to merge and mix and combinate
      - they would have needed to know the extent of geography very well.
        - at least knowing the old world very, very well (and likely of the existance of the new world)
        - this would be greatly facilitated by the cultural apparatus that created harappa in the first place
          - as well as by the trade and commerce that helped it push forward
      - they would have picked the most basic, most primal elements of language and culture
        - they would have known that if they succeeded in rolling this plan out
          - that competition would keep civilizations in contained and none would gain too much superiority
      - i think they may have also decided to make their civilization vanish,
        - although i can't quite decide on why that is
  - this protocivilization would have also understood the problems of agriculture and resource limitations
    - and once the harappan civilization was doomed (by earthquake or whatever)
      - they would have been motivated to develop some kind of plan to avoid catastrophe

and this is where the story for the wise arch-mage came from
- who was born in an ancient, but doomed world
- and who divided a great magic into 7 forms to be spread to the corners of the earth
  - to be hidden in plain view until the world was ready
  - and until the world had a great need to unite these magic forms into one
  - which he knew would occur at the same time, the most critical time for our development
