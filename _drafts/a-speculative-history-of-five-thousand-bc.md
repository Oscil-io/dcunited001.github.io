- personal beliefs on the transmission of culture throughout the world around 3,000 B.C.
  - that mostly lack evidence by the way
  - harappan civilization was created in the ancient world after the 'center' of the ancient world was identified
    - over the course of 1,000 years (starting ~4,000 B.C.) -- timeline is not too important here
      - after the cataclysm wiped out most of seaside human civilization
      - after the archetype of cataclysm wiping out human civilization was fresh in our minds
        - therefore we would have been determined to ensure it would not happen again
    - it is possible for humantity to unconsciously cooperate, even with limited communication
    - we would have spread culture and myth to 'advertise' this place 
      - where great thinkers would go to develop technology
      - this could have occured through the development of myth over the course of 1,000-1,500 years
    - the 'center' of the world would have needed to be mostly known by this point
      - people understanding tradecraft would have understood that the 'center' of the world
        - would offer the most opportunity, 
          - as that would have the greatest amount of aggregate human dispersion
        - this is only understandable after developing moderate maths
          - but still before developing widespread written language
            - there's a difference between written language and written communication
    - the most powerful information to have at this time would be geographic information
      - and accurate geographic information.  
      - elements of mythology from this time should reflect this.
      - where are the most valuable resources?
        - how can we be sure? how many people know?
        - where does the land end?  does it ever?
        - how do we know where we are? how do we know where we should go? (the stars)
        - if the center is where the power is, how do we know where the center is?
    - and because multiple civilizations would be able to develop an understanding of:
      - (1) the center of the world being the most powerful and offering the most opportunity
      - (2) as well as the estimated direction towards the center
      - then with these two ideas these precivilizations could push emmisaries towards the center of the world
        - first, to establish communication networks with the rest of the world
        - second to accelerate the development of technology and culture
      - and most importantly, the more advanced minor precivilizations would do this unconsciously
        - and if they were wise enough to anticipate other culture's understanding of these ideas
          - they could do so with anticipation that others would be there to meet them in the center!
          - again, WITH NO COMMUNICATION.  based solely on metaphysics and wisdom.
  - so i believe this was the plan, spontaneously developed across the world after the pain of the cataclysm
    - after people had experienced the sum of antiquity 
      - and the aggregate developments of their ancestry just simply vanish into nothingness
    - i believe this is what cultivated the desire of ancient civilizations
      -  to want to 'leave their mark' with monolithic archetecture
    - they had experienced the pain of losing everything
      - that pain transmuted itself into a universal archetype
    - and so, they pushed to find a way to ensure that it never happened again
      - while simultaneously understanding the problem of exponential growth and overpopulation
      - overpopulation and the cataclysm are two primative archetypes 
        - from the dawn of humanity at the end of the ice age
        - these factor into our actions at a collective unconscious level
  - and so "the plan" was to develop human culture and technology to limit the suffering of the world
    - to limit the global trauma of overpopulation, while ensuring survival in the face of the next catastrophe
  - and so there are many cultural tools and treasures developed during the harappan civilization at the time
    - the civilization had plumbing and other amazing technologies.  basically the equivalent of rome
      - i wonder whether this civilization was planned in a region they knew would run out of water eventually
    - i believe that they vigorously studied linguistics that the time.
      - linguistics would have been fascinating.  
      - to develop culture tools to ensure humanitys survival, they would have found linguistics invaluable.
      - they would have assessed the properties, pros and cons of various linguistic forms (SVO/SOV/VSO/etc)
    - and i believe it is here that we find the mystery of babel (and the mystery of the proto-indo-european)
      - all the world developed a universal language here.  it would have been invaluable to do so
        - therefore, all the languages began to come together into one
      - however, this unity invites advantage in developing discord.
        - accents and microdialects are developed in cities today 
          - with the purpose of creating a system of communication that is difficult for others to understand
        - therefore, the unity of a universal language, invites the development of competing languages
      - so, one language was created, then other competing languages were subversively cultivated
        - here, you have would typically have many languages created at first,
        - then one of those languages would become superior and would become the prime competing language
    - this unified langauge wouldn't immediately be transmitted to the rest of the world of course,
      - but as the prime source of culture that impregnated the world, it's effect would be adumbrating
  - evidence of these lingual developments can be found in sanskrit
    - sankrit as a written language was specifically developed to capture nearly every possible human sound
      - there are 7 different vowels and 2 variations of each for a total of fourteen
      - the language elegantly handles digraphs/trigraphs and universally captures all of those sounds
    - i believe that the original harappan language vanished because of this
      - and this is mostly my prime basis for all these beliefs, which are mostly extensions of this
    - the harappans studied language more than anything else and developed this perfect universal language
      - captured in sanskrit. which could be used to capture and study other languages
      - to facilitate the development of the perfect language
  - however, out of the study of language in this civilization, 
    - i believe another thing happened that would be missed by most
    - and this is that the particular advantages/disadvantages and the facets of each lingual structure 
      - would have been vigorously studied by the intelligentsia of the time.  (making them more intelligent)
      - these people would have been incredibly wise.
    - and i believe they crafted a plan to resolve a debate on language/culture
      - and to provide humanity with cultural tools to recombine thousands of years later
        - that altogether these cultural tools would be far more powerful than any one would be alone
        - but that if any one of these were to absolutely rule over the others before we were ready
        - their descendents would end up creating a terrible homogenous world
      - and so they seeded regions of the earth with various forms of language and culture, 
        - isolating them from having too much influence on each other
        - but still allowing adjacent cultures to merge and mix and combinate
      - they would have needed to know the extent of geography very well. 
        - at least knowing the old world very, very well (and likely of the existance of the new world)
        - this would be greatly facilitated by the cultural apparatus that created harappa in the first place
          - as well as by the trade and commerce that helped it push forward
      - they would have picked the most basic, most primal elements of language and culture
        - they would have known that if they succeeded in rolling this plan out
          - that competition would keep civilizations in contained and none would gain too much superiority
      - i think they may have also decided to make their civilization vanish,
        - although i can't quite decide on why that is
  - this protocivilization would have also understood the problems of agriculture and resource limitations
    - and once the harappan civilization was doomed (by earthquake or whatever)
      - they would have been motivated to develop some kind of plan to avoid catastrophe

and this is where the story for the wise arch-mage came from
- who was born in an ancient, but doomed world
- and who divided a great magic into 7 forms to be spread to the corners of the earth
  - to be hidden in plain view until the world was ready 
  - and until the world had a great need to unite these magic forms into one
  - which he knew would occur at the same time, the most critical time for our development
