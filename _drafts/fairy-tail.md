a modern fairy tale

in a land whose cities have long since been swept away by the sands of time...

TODO: what kind of symbols to use?

a wandering mage in a new land happens to meet a traveling girl
- as she was from a faraway land, and the mage loved hearing about
  faraway things
  - she immediately attracted his attention.  in fact, it was her
    voice.
    - that's what he heard first.  if he'd seen her lavish clothes or
      all her attendents
    - he likely never would have spoken to her, as he didn't value
      those things
      - and didn't understand those who did
  - but he turned around and saw the most beautiful woman he'd ever
    seen
    - it was love at first sight for him
    - maybe it was the way she looked at him,
      - maybe it was the way he looked at her
- however, he finds out that she's engaged and, to his dismay, a
  princess
  - his world is crushed, knowing what the world thinks about magi,
    - or people who claim to have knowledge and powers like those he
      hides
  - knowing she's engaged and hearing her father is ill, he decides he
    wants to help her
    - though, knowing she has the best advisers in the world and too
      many friends,
      - isn't sure how much help he could do
- he wants to establish a friendship, even though he's sure he'll
  never see her again
  - in fact, this partly motivates many of his actions
    - he wants to impart as much advice as he can
    - this also motivates him to reveal his feelings for her, even
      though it's pointless
- he advises her on power and tells stories he's learned in his
  travels, which have always helped him
  - he tells her to look out for herself and to measure the worth of
    others who claim to be of value
  - he wants her to feel the best she could possibly feel about
    herself.  she's a princess, after all
    - so he inflates her ego a bit.  and is pleasantly surprised when
      she does the same.
- he once heard of another prince from not too long ago, who wandered
  outside the palace walls
  - the prince was changed forever by what he saw, spent his life in
    meditation, instead of at war
  - the prince taught many masters who, through the course of many
    generations,
    - one of those masters in that lineage taught him
- he could sense she was guarded. perhaps not as sheltered as the
  prince.
  - but he hoped he could show her part of himself that might give her
    a glimpse of people she'd never seen
    - not in a particularly emo way though
  - he was worried that she was too highly regarded, too protected.
    - that the people around her were often just trying to curry favor
    - and that being around this kind of behavior distorted her
      perception, as it would anyone's
      - that's a curse of power & celebrity
- in the course of talking to her, he unintentionally teaches her a
  bit of magic and she catches on too fast
  - he begins to worry that he'll get in trouble.  or worse, she will.
  - he hesitates to tell her, but decides he must. she has to learn to
    control it, or it could bring trouble
    - instead, she thanks him.  for teaching her and for being so
      honest.
- and so she offers to grant him one wish.  anything he'd like.
  - he doesn't really believe her.  so .. he asks for her hand in
    marriage to see if she's for real
    - about the wish and, well, about him. even though it's pointless
      bc she's already engaged
  - she hesitates at first (not in a bad way though, like in a - holy
    shit did he just say that kinda way)
    - she says yes.
- the mage decides that he couldn't possibly force her to do that with
  a wish
  - and he starts to feel really bad and frets, trying to ask for
    something of equal value
    - equal value is important here because you don't want ask to
      exchange such a gift
      - with something of lesser value.  they may think you didn't
        value the original gift.
  - they had been talking about immortality earlier,
    - an idea he thought preposterous, with what he knew of magic
    - so he asked for it, again, thinking she could never fulfill it
- the princess says yes.  of course.  she believes it's totally
  possible.
  - unbeknownst to most, a high priest in her kingdom has been
    promising the king immortality
- the mage freaks out a bit.  really, she wasn't supposed to say yes
  - the mage doesn't really like accepting gifts from anyone,
    especially those he can't repay
- hermes, or the messenger god (another name?), has been secretly
  listening in to the conversation,
  - sheds a tear, a master mage himself, moved by the experience,
    - knowing full well these two are in love and ought to be
    - yet knowing how improbable such an event would be
  - he also happens to know that the priest is lying and instead
    slowly poisoning the king
    - and running the country into the ground, while the king is
      slowly dying
- so hermes shows sophia (athena) who is the goddess of wisdom
  - all that he has seen.  however sophia reminds hermes:
    - gods are not allowed to mettle in mortal affairs
    - as much as she wants to help make things right for both of them
  - hermes figured so much.  but hatches a plan anyways.
    - without violating too much of the whole "gods shall not
      interfere" thing
    - he's not too sure he can get them together, because all gods
      know:
      - meddling in mortal affairs is stupid, risky, against the
        rules.
      - but meddling with love is playing with fire.
  - but he figures that he can fetch water from the river of the dead
    (styx)
    - and trick the mage into drinking it, bestowing eternal life
    - that way, the princess won't have to know that she couldn't
      grant the mage's clever wish.
      - hmmm.. but if he did this, wouldn't he be helping the priest
        out?
        - or maybe it's a sly play and hermes know's what is going to
          happen

- mage & princess part,
  - the mage truthfully never expects to see her again,
    - nor does he expect to gain immortality
  - the have definitely exchanged gifts by this point, but what gifts?
    - this is very important, as the mage needs to carry the gift with
      him
      - but be completely confused as to how he got those fucking kale
        chips.
      - i mean kale chips.  goddamn, who the fuck even eats those?
        lmao

- the priest is hoping for political gains once the marriage goes
  through,
  - as he has secret financial ties with certain elements in her
    fiance's country
    - this is of course unknown to the fiance and they are honestly in
      love
  - this is also why the priest has been seeking to throw his own
    country into chaos
    - because he'll profit in power and finance later

- the priest, who's been secretly poisoning the king, has heard of
  their meeting
  - well before the princess even asks for him to grant the mage
    immortality
  - first, the priest feigns to be reviled that she would talk to a
    mage
    - even though he's secretly one himself.  a very wicked mage.
  - but he promises her that he'll follow through
    - however, he intends for him to "happen to be poisoned" by the
      very gift which is supposed to grant life
    - he is sure that the allure of immortality will be the temptation
      our hero cannot refuse
      - and thus, essentially the nail in his coffin
- and so the priest hires an assassin and gives him two vials:
  - one is a poison and one is the antidote.  they are not clearly
    marked bc this is secret business
  - the assassin is to have both.  he is to offer the mage a drink
    from immortality
    - the other will supposedly make him forget that he and the
      princess ever met
  - the mage is to choose between them both
    - one, he will live forever, but regretting he'll never know the
      love of his life
    - or, he can forget that it all happened (which wouldn't ever
      happen)
  - the priest is explicit.  if for some reason he doesn't die, kill
    him.
    - the priest also instructs the assassin to drink the other vial
      - which will make him forget his mission (a la hashashins)

- mage becomes immortal
  - elaborate on this event

- the assassin approaches the mage in a new city, first posing as an
  old friend.
  - the mage doesn't recognize him and knows to be wary
    - however, is intrigued when intuition causes his hair to stand on
      end
  - it's this curiosity that's nearly killed him so many times before
    - yet has taught him so much at the same time
- mage catches a bad vibe and tries to leave, but is then intrigued to
  learn there's a connection to the princesses, thus stays
- the mage has tried to forget, desperately
  - so when the assassin approaches him, he is grateful for the
    opportunity to forget
- the assassin becomes worried: this was unexpected.
  - how could someone turn down immortality? and so quickly?
    - hasn't he heard of the power of this priest? even the priest
      seemed sure it would work
      - TODO: resolve plot inconsistency problems here and elsewhere
        with the poison stuff
      - without devaluing this event. assassin must present mage with
        choice, mage must choose to forget,
        - assassin must act selfishly and attempt to cure himself and
          in doing so die
        - mage must be arrested bc of this
  - the assassin performs a "miracle" with the supposed elixir of
    immortality
    - as instructed by the priest.  he's worried the mage doesn't
      believe him
  - the mage still doesn't value eternal life, as he believes
    something greater lies beyond this one
    - how can he begin that journey if he lives forever?
  - and he still mostly wants to forget, secretly hoping that if he
    does,
    - then maybe he'll be able to fall in love again
- the assassin hands him the poison anyways, unaware that the mage is
  already immortal
  - the mage drinks half of it, then starts entering a stupor,
    laughing maniacly
    - because it's that kind of deadly witches brew,
  - the assassin freaks out and believes he has drunk the poison
    - believing the other to be an antidote, he reaches for it before
      our hero finishes it
    - he downs it, sealing his fate
- the mage is immediately arrested for killing the assassin
  - and worse still, he has lost all memory of the princess (?)
  - TODO: how does he get out of jail?
    - gets death penalty?  escapes at execution?
    - is it public execution that alerts public of his immortality?
      - what form? how does it fail? it needs to be spectacular.
        we've got an audience people
  - TODO: how/when does he regain memory?
    - when seeing someone who was with the princess, but not her
    - after the forest/illusions section

- the priest hears of this and learns about the mages true immortality
  - the priest knows all too well that immortality is a blessing and a
    curse,
    - so he instead plans to assail the mage's reputation with false
      charges
  - the priest is also threatened by the immortality, as someone who
    can't die is a problem
    - especially if they know the priest has been lying to the king

(would it be possible, for at least some time, for the mage to not
know he's immortal or not understand its nature? innocence can help
develop the character here or accentuate the themes.)

- the king hears about it and invites the mage learn more about a new
  elixir of immortality
  - the king has also heard of this mage's wisdom and even a bit about
    his white magic from the princess
  - she told him that the mage may have a plan to save the kingdom and
    solve [some of] their problems
  - (?) king sends emissary, without knowing about mage in jail.
    priest kills emissaries.
    - (does the priest blame the mage for the death of the emissaries?
      perhaps he creates some false spectacle that implicates the mage
      as not only rejecting the king, but publicly defying him. the
      priest could sell it as the mage plotting to overthrow the king?
      not sure how this meshes with everything else i have now)

- the gods find out about his immortality and are completely pissed at
  hermes
  - they also suspect sophia (athena) had something to do with it,
    - (and maybe she did, unbeknownst to them all)
      - after all, the hand of wisdom remains unseen
    - did she witness hermes take the water to the mage?
      - and let him get away with it, wise enough to understand the
        consequences?
  - TODO: what are the gods going to do?

- meanwhile, the people think that the priest actually did it
  - he's worried about being found out as a fraud,
    - but also enjoys the further boost to his power
  - however, the people are pissed.  the priest made a mage immortal?
    - and why can't the priest heal the king?  and why is their
      country going to shit
  - yet, they direct their anger towards the mage

- the princess thinks .... hmmm what does the princess think?
  - does she believe the priest did it?
    - yes/no/maybe .. i think she's starting to lose trust after
      certain events
  - she feels her obligation is paid off to the mage? (even though he
    really didn't do anything)
    - but never really felt "obliged" - moreso wanted to do it, but
      wasn't too concerned with it, as she never thought she'd see him
      again either
  - but her intuition tells her something is not right

- the princess sends a message to the mage, but is unsure if he
  received it
  - as the messenger was tortured and killed after making contact and
    delivering the message
  - the message was unclear and the mage is unsure what to do,
  - he has no idea who sent it, but only knows where it came from and
    that they need help

- the priest decides that, while he cannot kill the mage, there are
  other things he can do.

- the mage starts a journey to her kingdom, but along the way,
  - the priest has set a trap to draw the mage into a forest of
    illusion
  - the mage is alone but ends up following himself around in the
    forest
    - (losing himself, as well as his magick)
    - he gets completely caught up in a maze of illusions involving
      visions of himself
      - it's a "lost forest" zelda throwback
    - the visions of himself delude him and cause him to believe his
      current circumstances are all his fault
      - eventually he can no longer distinguish the reflections of
        himself from his actual body
      - and starts having strange out-of-body experiences
    - the visions take him down some very dark places
  - finally makes it out of that
    - TODO: .. how exactly?
    - however, he's missing a huge part of himself through the ordeal
      and has lost most of his magick
      - TODO: what can symbolize this loss?  a jewel? .. maybe
      - worse still, he doesn't even know what he's looking for or
        what awaits him

- then the priest works with some other magi in the area and concocts
  a scheme to put the mage into a coma
  - ...
  - somehow they pull it off, while our hero is on his way to warn the
    princess
    - he falls into a deep coma, in a cave high in a mountain range
  - and somehow she has to become the heroine
- because otherwise it'd just be a helpless princess story lulz
  - TODO: or the magi are good, they find him and help him "find
    himself" within the coma

- while mage is in coma, he can barely move, or can't turn around. or
  something.
  - trying to create a scene that draws from plato's allegory of the
    cave
  - mage is basically stuck staring at the cave wall.
    - the only light entering his part of the cave is being
      reflected/refracted off giant crystals
      - and onto the wall in front of him.  the light partially hits
        plants & etc as it enters
    - the dancing shadow's create hallucinations and construct an
      illusory experience (similar to plato's cave)
      - or is he trapped within a crystal?
  - mage's only choice is to meditate, for however long it takes
    (month's, year's)
    - he can't die, so food is not a problem.  (but what happens to
      him as a result?)
  - eventually, he regains his magic and his control over himself is
    restored, but he is still trapped
    - and this point, the illusory experience created by the shadows
      is no longer haunting
  - he realizes he is stuck and seeks to free himself through
    nirvana(??) but isn't sure it's possible
    - i really want to chill with the buddhist imagery here.
    - but maybe he wants to free himself of this life to begin the
      next,
      - hoping he'll be more capable and more prepared to resolve the
        situation then
  - he realizes the only thing he has power over at this point is his
    mind & spirit
    - he seeks to sharpen this through meditation
    - originally, from his arrest and the trap in the forest of
      illusion, he pretty much lost himself
      - he couldn't understand why it all happened to him and he just
        lost the best parts of himself
      - he became bitter and angry. he blamed others, even though he
        didn't realize why it was happening to him
    - he seeks to let it all go, which requires releasing his control
      over the situation
    - he feels guilty for having affected a situation and possibly
      caused things to become worse for the princess, his friends and
      everyone else

- where does everyone think the mage has gone? what is the priest
  doing in his absence?
  - how much time passes? and what happens to the princess and her
    fiance in the meantime?
  - what happens to the king?  the kingdom?

- mage in a coma, meanwhile, gods are satisfied because immortal guy
  is effectively KO'd
  - and thus, their meddling has effectively stopped producing
    downstream ripples in the .. karma fabric
  - except hermes and sophia.
    - sophia is worried because the positive vibes this guy was
      putting off
      - have been replaced by an equal but dark negative force
      - not stemming from him, but stemming from the imbalance of his
        absence
        - turns out this guy was pretty important, albeit indirectly,
        - in maintaining an universal balance in the world
      - meanwhile, balance of power has tipped far in the evil
        priest's favor
    - hermes feels shitty, thinking this guy could have simply died,
      if it weren't for him
      - he knows the curse of immortality all too well
- sophia, acting against her wise non-interventional nature,
  - decides to secretly warn the princess in a dream
  - TODO: dream content

- princess's reaction to dream(s)?

==================

alternative "coma" ideas:

#### Mage's body frozen into a statue and soul trapped in the cave

- the mage's consciousness or awareness or body is split into two. one
  of these apparitions is somehow frozen as a statue, with a myth that
  the legend that one day someone will awaken the mage, who will save
  the kingdom from pure, sinister darkness.
  - however, when this statue is seen by the naked eye, it causes
    blindness in those who look upon it for at least a year.
    - it's because of the intense light radiating out from the
      uncovered statue. it's bright to the point of quickly burning
      the skin of those in its presence
    - it cannot be moved (did the God's place it there to force the
      people to remain aware of their sin? and to force them remain
      aware of an evil which subverted the kingdom and who claims to
      be all powerful, but cannot ... because they can't even move
      this thing)
  - people think that the statue is the "real" mage, because that's
    the only one they are aware of.
    - anyone who looks into the "truth" of it is blinded
  - all they can talk about - they muse on the posturing of the statue
    - wondering when it will be awoken to dispense justice on the
      usurpers in power afterwards.
    - it's claimed to be put "on display" but cannot be seen, as its
      visage is shielded and covered, leading to mistaken presumptions
      of the posture of the statue.
    - but the mage's soul is actually trapped in the cave, so until
      someone understands what exactly happened and where, it's an
      impossible situation to resolve.
- perhaps the satatue story happens at a different point than the cave
  - and perhaps the princess goes into a deep sleep after this because
    part of her soul is intertwined with his
  - this sets up the perfect un-suppressable story that keeps hope
    alive in a kingdom which for 3 generations lives under total
    tyrrany from a mad priest, who was forced to face the torment of
    looking at himself without being sheilded by his ego.
    - a perfect scene for his transition to "perfect" evil (or at
      least the emphasis of it) would involve looking into a mirror
      - (see misc scene ideas)

- and perhaps they two don't wake up again after a very long time
  (1-10 generations) and for some reason, the Gods protect them from
  being interfered with, much to the chagrin of tyrants
  - each of their souls, the princess and the mage is unaware of the
    full truth and is convinced the other died or is unable to save
    them or worse.
  - they are trapped fighting ghosts/delusions


==================

misc scene ideas:

- mage is traveling, but alone. he visits a small twon where a school of
  magic is based.  he's in pretty bad shape (but not that bad, just doesn't
  have much money)
  - he's learning a new form of magic and really doesn't want to pay
    attention to anything else at the moment
- but everyone is giving him shit
  - people are literally queued up to create negative situations for him

- priest's transition to perfect evil by looking into a mirror
  - the priest deludes himself into ironic assumptions (A,B, & C)
    after recently acquiring an artifact he thinks grants him power
  - the artifact is a special kind of mirror, but it instead reveals
    his true self to him while dissolving the narcissistic ego that
    shields him from himself.
    - a special kind of transplanar being takes over his body that
      allows this to happen and forces him to see the truth of what he
      was. the transplanar being is neither good nor evil, just
      (somehow associated with truth)
    - something happens, the being leaves his consciousness and there
      are many others who witnessed what happened.
      - they immediately begin running in fear and letting people know
        what happened
    - however, the priest's ego begins to take hold again and is
      reviling in disgust at himself, which causes all his negative
      qualities to rebound and double.
      - he begins rounding people up and consolidating power. not soon
        after, the priest consolidates near total power. the truth is
        soon forgotton, preserved in stories and characters.
