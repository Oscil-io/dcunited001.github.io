a modern fairy tale

in a land whose cities have long since been swept away by the sands of time...

a wandering mage happens to meet a traveling girl
- as she was from a faraway land, and the mage loved hearing about faraway things
  - she immediately attracted his attention.  in fact, it was her voice.
    - that's what he heard first.  if he'd seen her lavish clothes or all her attendents
    - he likely never would have spoken to her, as he didn't value those things
      - and didn't understand those who did
  - but he turned around and saw the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen
    - it was love at first sight for him
    - maybe it was the way she looked at him,
      - maybe it was the way he looked at her
- however, he finds out that she's engaged and, to his dismay, a princess
  - his world is crushed, knowing what the world thinks about magi,
    - or people who claim to have knowledge and powers like those he hides
  - knowing she's engaged and hearing her father is ill, he decides he wants to help her
    - though, knowing she has the best advisers in the world and too many friends,
      - isn't sure how much help he could do
- he wants to establish a friendship, even though he's sure he'll never see her again
  - in fact, this partly motivates many of his actions
    - he wants to impart as much advice as he can
    - this also motivates him to reveal his feelings for her, even though it's pointless
- he advises her on power and tells stories he's learned in his travels, which have always helped him
  - he tells her to look out for herself and to measure the worth of others who claim to be of value
  - he wants her to feel the best she could possibly feel about herself.  she's a princess, after all
    - so he inflates her ego a bit.  and is pleasantly surprised when she does the same.
- he once heard of another prince from not too long ago, who wandered outside the palace walls
  - the prince was changed forever by what he saw, spent his life in meditation, instead of at war
  - the prince taught many masters who, through the course of many generations,
    - one of those masters in that lineage taught him
- he could sense she was guarded. perhaps not as sheltered as the prince.
  - but he hoped he could show her part of himself that might give her a glimpse of people she'd never seen
    - not in a particularly emo way though
  - he was worried that she was too highly regarded, too protected.
    - that the people around her were often just trying to curry favor
    - and that being around this kind of behavior distorted her perception, as it would anyone's
- in the course of talking to her, he unintentionally teaches her a bit of magic and she catches on too fast
  - he begins to worry that he'll get in trouble.  or worse, she will.
  - he hesitates to tell her, but decides he must. she has to learn to control it, or it could bring trouble
    - instead, she thanks him.  for teaching her and for being so honest.
- and so she offers to grant him one wish.  anything he'd like.
  - he doesn't really believe her.  so .. he asks for her hand in marriage to see if she's for real
    - about the wish and, well, about him. even though it's pointless bc she's already engaged
  - she hesitates at first (not in a bad way though, like in a - holy shit did he just say that kinda way)
    - she says yes.
- the mage decides that he couldn't possibly force her to do that with a wish
  - and he starts to feel really bad and frets, trying to ask for something of equal value
    - equal value is important here because you don't want ask to exchange such a gift
      - with something of lesser value.  they may think you didn't value the original gift.
  - they had been talking about immortality earlier,
    - an idea he thought preposterous, with what he knew of magic
    - so he asked for it, again, thinking she could never fulfill it
- the princess says yes.  of course.  she believes it's totally possible.
  - unbeknownst to most, a high priest in her kingdom has been promising the king immortality
- the mage freaks out a bit.  really, she wasn't supposed to say yes
  - the mage doesn't really like accepting gifts from anyone, especially those he can't repay
- hermes, or the messenger god, has been secretly listening in to the conversation,
  - sheds a tear, a master mage himself, moved by the experience,
    - knowing full well these two are in love and ought to be
    - yet knowing how improbable such an event would be
  - he also happens to know that the priest is lying and instead slowly poisoning the king
    - and running the country into the ground, while the king is slowly dying
- so hermes shows sophia (athena) who is the goddess of wisdom
  - all that he has seen.  however sophia reminds hermes:
    - gods are not allowed to mettle in mortal affairs
    - as much as she wants to help make things right for both of them
  - hermes figured so much.  but hatches a plan anyways.
    - without violating too much of the whole "gods shall not interfere" thing
    - he's not too sure he can get them together, because all gods know:
      - meddling in mortal affairs is stupid, risky, against the rules.
      - but meddling with love is playing with fire.
  - but he figures that he can fetch water from the river of the dead (styx)
    - and trick the mage into drinking it, bestowing eternal life
    - that way, the princess won't have to know that she couldn't grant the mage's clever wish.

- mage & princess part,
  - the mage truthfully never expects to see her again,
    - nor does he expect to gain immortality

- the priest is hoping for political gains once the marriage goes through,
  - as he has secret financial ties with certain elements in her fiance's country
    - this is of course unknown to the fiance and they are honestly in love
  - this is also why the priest has been seeking to throw his own country into chaos
    - because he'll profit in power and finance later

- the priest, who's been secretly poisoning the king, has heard of their meeting
  - well before the princess even asks for him to grant the mage immortality
  - first, the priest feigns to be reviled that she would talk to a mage
    - even though he's secretly one himself.  a very wicked mage.
  - but he promises her that he'll follow through
    - however, he intends for him to "happen to be poisoned" by the very gift which is supposed to grant life
    - he is sure that the allure of immortality will be the temptation our hero cannot refuse
      - and thus, essentially the nail in his coffin
- and so the priest hires an assassin and gives him two vials:
  - one is a poison and one is the antidote.  they are not clearly marked bc this is secret business
  - the assassin is to have both.  he is to offer the mage a drink from immortality
    - the other will supposedly make him forget that he and the princess ever met
  - the mage is to choose between them both
    - one, he will live forever, but regretting he'll never know the love of his life
    - or, he can forget that it all happened (which wouldn't ever happen)
  - the priest is explicit.  if for some reason he doesn't die, kill him.
    - the priest also instructs the assassin to drink the other vial
      - which will make him forget his mission (a la hashashins)

- mage becomes immortal
  - elaborate on this event

- the assassin approaches the mage in a new city, first posing as an old friend.
  - the mage doesn't recognize him and knows to be wary
    - however, is intrigued when intuition causes his hair to stand on end
  - it's this curiosity that's nearly killed him so many times before
    - yet has taught him so much at the same time
- the mage has tried to forget, desperately
  - so when the assassin approaches him, he is grateful for the opportunity to forget
- the assassin becomes worried: this was unexpected.
  - how could someone turn down immortality? and so quickly?
    - hasn't he heard of the power of this priest? even the priest was sure it would work
  - the assassin performs a "miracle" with the supposed elixir of immortality
    - as instructed by the priest.  he's worried the mage doesn't believe him
  - the mage still doesn't value eternal life, as he believes something greater lies beyond this one
    - how can he begin that journey if he lives forever?
  - and he still mostly wants to forget, secretly hoping that if he does,
    - then maybe he'll be able to fall in love again
- the assassin hands him the poison anyways, unaware that the mage is already immortal
  - the mage drinks half of it, then starts entering a stupor, laughing maniacly
    - because it's that kind of deadly witches brew,
  - the assassin freaks out and believes he has drunk the poison
    - believing the other to be an antidote, he reaches for it before our hero finishes it
    - he downs it, sealing his fate
- the mage is immediately arrested for killing the assassin
  - and worse still, he has lost all memory of the princess (?)
  - TODO: how does he get out of jail?
    - gets death penalty?  escapes at execution?
  - TODO: how/when does he regain memory?
    - when seeing someone who was with the princess, but not her
    - after the forest/illusions section

- the priest hears of this and learns about the mages true immortality
  - the priest knows all too well that immortality is a blessing and a curse,
    - so he instead plans to assail the mage's reputation with false charges
  - the priest is also threatened by the immortality, as someone who can't die is a problem
    - especially if they know the priest has been lying to the king

- the king hears about it and invites the mage learn more about a new elixir of immortality
  - the king has also heard of this mage's wisdom and even a bit about his white magic from the princess
  - she told him that the mage may have a plan to save the kingdom and solve [some of] their problems
  - (?) king sends emissary, without knowing about mage in jail.  priest kills emissaries.

- the gods find out about his immortality and are completely pissed at hermes
  - they also suspect sophia (athena) had something to do with it,
    - (and maybe she did, unbeknownst to them all)
      - after all, the hand of wisdom remains unseen
    - did she witness hermes take the water to the mage?
      - and let him get away with it, wise enough to understand the consequences?
  - TODO: what are the gods going to do?

- meanwhile, the people think that the priest actually did it
  - he's worried about being found out as a fraud,
    - but also enjoys the further boost to his power
  - however, the people are pissed.  the priest made a mage immortal?
    - and why can't the priest heal the king?  and why is their country going to shit
  - yet, they direct their anger towards the mage

- the princess thinks .... hmmm what does the princess think?
  - does she believe the priest did it?
    - yes/no/maybe .. i think she's starting to lost trust after certain events
  - she feels her obligation is paid off to the mage? (even though he really didn't do anything)
  - but her intuition tells her something is not right

- the princess sends a message to the mage, but is unsure if he received it
  - as the messenger was tortured and killed after making contact and delivering the message
  - the message was unclear and the mage is unsure what to do,
  - he has no idea who sent it, but only knows where it came from and that they need help

- the priest decides that, while he cannot kill the mage, there are other things he can do.

- the mage starts a journey to her kingdom, but along the way,
  - the priest has set a trap to draw the mage into a forest of illusion
  - the mage is alone but ends up following himself around in the forest
    - (losing himself, as well as his magick)
    - he gets completely caught up in a maze of illusions involving visions of himself
      - it's a "lost forest" zelda throwback
    - the visions of himself delude him and cause him to believe his current circumstances are all his fault
      - eventually he can no longer distinguish the reflections of himself from his actual body
      - and starts having strange out-of-body experiences
    - the visions take him down some very dark places
  - finally makes it out of that
    - TODO: .. how exactly?
    - however, he's missing a huge part of himself through the ordeal and has lost most of his magick
      - TODO: what can symbolize this loss?  a jewel? .. maybe
      - worse still, he doesn't even know what he's looking for or what awaits him

- then the priest works with some other magi in the area and concocts a scheme to put the mage into a coma
  - ...
  - somehow they pull it off, while our hero is on his way to warn the princess
    - he falls into a deep coma, in a cave high in a mountain range
  - and somehow she has to become the heroine
- because otherwise it'd just be a helpless princess story lulz
  - TODO: or the magi are good, they find him and help him "find himself" within the coma

- mage in a coma, meanwhile, gods are satisfied because immortal guy is effectively KO'd
  - and thus, their meddling has effectively stopped producing downstream ripples in the .. karma fabric
  - except hermes and sophia.
    - sophia is worried because the positive vibes this guy was putting off
      - have been replaced by an equal but dark negative force
      - not stemming from him, but stemming from the imbalance of his absence
        - turns out this guy was pretty important, albeit indirectly,
        - in maintaining an universal balance in the world
      - meanwhile, balance of power has tipped far in the evil priest's favor
    - hermes feels shitty, thinking this guy could have simply died, if it weren't for him
      - he knows the curse of immortality all too well
- sophia, acting against her wise non-interventional nature,
  - decides to secretly warn the princess in a dream
  - TODO: dream content

- princess's reaction to dream?
