### Nathan's defense of socialism

Just because it's different, doesn't mean it's "wrong," or "evil." And
it doesn't guarantee that it is destined to fail. I know that there is
an assumption that societies that value the poor equally with the
privileged can't succeed, because it costs too much. And I do
appreciate concerns about where the money for these "bleeding heart"
programs would come from.

I could be wrong, but I believe that our programs that subsidize the
wealthy cost us more than programs that help our poor. And Denmark
fully funds their social programs with higher tax rates, particularly
on the wealthy. Patriotic Danes accept this expense as the cost of
living in a decent, moral country.

Furthermore, the government spending in countries that have robust
public sectors helps the private businesses in their local communities
in several ways. First of all, they reduce the costs individuals and
businesses have to cover by providing affordable healthcare and
education to their employees. Beyond that, having a well funded public
sector helps private businesses by providing them with paying
customers.

I don't think that we should simply adopt the Danish system here in
the US. That wouldn't be realistic. But I do believe there are things
we could learn from them about how to collectively pay for the
resources we all need (healthcare, education, and energy) in order to
reduce our costs.

I also agree that we should not "punish" the wealthy for their
success. If you work hard, and provide a unique skill that allows
those around you to profit, you should be compensated
accordingly. Those who go above and beyond should have more.

The question is how much more is appropriate, and at what point does
paying the rich more become detrimental to the rest of the economy?
Money needs to flow through the economy. When a CEO's income pools too
deeply, it deprives the other workers in a company of the income they
need to be effective consumers in our economy.

As a human being who has been exceedingly fortunate to have been given
the opportunities I have had, I feel that it is crucial to recognize
that we are all vulnerable to forces that are beyond our
control. Anyone of us could be hit by a car, or develop a cancerous
tumor, through no fault of their own. Unfortunately, the potential for
tragedy to strike at any time, in all of our lives, is the one of the
truest forms of equality in this world.

The biggest difference in our ability to triumph over adversity is not
in the quality of our character. Instead, generational, or genetic
influences beyond an individual's control play a prominent role in the
potential to succeed. Millions of people in this world are born with
the odds of success staggeringly against them. If we truly believe in
the American Dream, then we should accept that our current system
favors those who are born into privilege, or with innate skills that
cannot be developed by everyone.

There are exceptions where individuals manage to escape poverty that
are often pointed to as proof that "the system works." However, those
exceptions are so rare, and the individuals who overcome them are so
talented, it proves the rule that most people can't escape through
hard work alone.

So how do we make the American Dream a reality for the person who
barely got through high school? Not because they were lazy, but
because they simply had a hard time with language, or math. Or maybe
they were hungry from lack of nutrition because their parent had to
work overtime at a minimum wage job just to keep the lights on.

As for the suggestion that Denmark is destined for the scrap heap of
history, I have a few genuine questions.

Are the Danes running massive deficits because they slashed taxes for
their wealthiest? Do working class Danes lack the resources they need
to support the businesses in their communities?

Did they blow massive holes in their budget on reckless military
campaigns to fight ideological wars? Do they then exacerbate those
conflicts by refusing diplomatic solutions and by insulting large
swaths of the world's population?

Do they prop up the increasingly expensive, nonrenewable, fossil fuel
industry with inane subsidies to compensate for their high costs and
environmental impact? Do they refuse to invest in clean, renewable
energy sources out of sheer stubbornness?

How certain is the imminent demise of an economic system that values
the well being of every citizen, over the extreme profits of a tiny
minority of well placed individuals?

Again, I do not mean to be insulting, and I'm not claiming that the
Danish model is perfect, nor that we should implement it wholesale
here in the US. But I do believe that there is a great deal that we
could learn from certain aspects of how the Danes pay for the services
that nearly everyone uses at some point.

Socialism is wrong. Not because it's different, but because it
undermines the foundations of a robust economy. It does so with the
best intentions, but it is incorrect. It inevitably fails because it
disrupts the fundamentals and dynamics of otherwise healthy
economies. Segments of the economy and industry types gradually
transfer control and financing from private to publicly funded
sectors. Socialism begins to transition economies based on capitalism
to the beginnings of a command economy where legislatures and
bureaucrats decide they understand more than people invested in
business themselves.

What follows is systemic corrosion of the economic foundation of
various types of business, meaning they are less competitive because
they have less control over their own business enterprises and their
partners in commerce have less control over theirs. It is most useful
to look at the economy through a lens informed by typology of
business. Socialists can't do this. They don't care about
business. They focus passionately on patching up the symptoms of
economic problems without ANY focus or knowledge on the root
causes. They do so with righteous ignorance unknown since the dark
ages. And they do so ignorant of internal and external sub/systems
that operate alongside their own nations economic sub/units.

"subsidize the wealthy" No offense, but that's the righteous ignorance
I'm talking about. Yes, subsidize is a transitive verb, but you can't
subsidize the wealthy. You can only fund things through the government
via taxes. In your holy war against monocled monopoly men, you forget
that what matters about taxes is not tax rates; it is tax volume. And
by dismantling and/or obfuscate economic fundamentals that permit
prosperity, **you inevitably reduce tax volume, either today or some
decades from today.** Socialism is mathematically/economically
unsustainable. It always is.

Leftists always pitch their arguments in terms of a class war for
social justice and it's just bullshit propaganda that is intended to
raise the number of people undereducated enough to believe it. And
that's what's sad: leftists can't actually deliver on their
promises. They just shout "free icecream" as loud as they can until
they deceive people into voting for them, like a sheisty TV
pastor. Meanwhile, leftists are never forced to account for the long
term sustainability of their programs because they distort the
paradigm of how these issues are presented to the American public.

Did you know that programs like Social Security, a rightfully
unquestionable social program, have alotted over $100 trillion in
non-discretionary federal spending? These programs are ticking
time-bombs, especially in context with the Baby Boomer generation and
overpopulation that WEAKEN ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS, blindly in ignorance
of the expense of their own viability.

It's because a bunch of pot smoking #GenerationY figured out the wrong
aspects of exponential population growth: they realized "there's more
of us; we can force the policies to change" without having the wisdom
of 3 generations' age to understand the actual implications of the
policies.

READ PLATO'S REPUBLIC, specifically the sections on cycles of
government. READ ARISTOTLE'S ETHICS, specifically, the sections on the
enumeration of virtues. From this enumeration of virtues, one can
create a kind of cartesian space, with one dimension per virtue. I
just wish I had a good means of visualizing to you #Demoralization
caused by socialist policies that swing nearly every one of those
specific virtues into the negative.

### Misc

It is unfortunately trivial for voters to blindly support socialist
policies in an economy dominated by Keynesian economics -- which is
sadly necessary, to some extent. it's just heartbreaking, how easy it
is to project the illusion of wealth in an economy where you control
the world's reserve currency and where you manipulate macroeconomic
factors. Yeh, it's nice when we're shielded from economic collapse by
a safety cushion of macroeconomic manipulation, but just as
psychological depression has a evolutionary function, so do periods of
tough times in an economy.

AMERICAN'S NEED SOME FEEDBACK FROM THE ECONOMY TO UNDERSTAND WHEN
CHEAP CREDIT IS NOT CUTTING IT. Because *this* is cause of the Great
Recession of 2007/2008 and it is NOT monocled monopoly men. It was
driven by LIBERAL economic policies from the 90's, primary driven
through in the clinton era, that *forced* banks to make bad
loans. THEY WERE REQUIRED BY SOCIALIST/LIBERAL ECONOMIC POLICIES IN
THE NAME OF DIVERSITY TO MAKE BAD BUSINESS DECISIONS. That's leftist
mucking in your economy, fucking it up for an entire industry, TO THE
DETRIMENT OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. And instead, what happened? Failure
was covered up by liberal band-aid after liberal band-aid through
macroeconomic shenanigans until the giant, world-ending credit bubble
finally burst.

And who do Bolsheviks ALWAYS blame it on? The wealthy. Do you
understand the true nature of the problems in our society. Trying to
cooperate with Neo-Bolsheviks is like trying to play Counterstrike
with trolls on your team. Create economic problems and just blame it
on the rich. Traitors and nothing else but blind, ignorant puppets,
fueled by misguided righteousness. Why can't we put that beautiful
righteous fervor into programs that actually help the problems you
care so much about?

Now, a liberal economic policy that I can get behind is
#MacroPrudential policy *BECAUSE IT ENFORCES STABILITY AS A FIRST
CLASS CITIZEN IN MACROECONOMICS*. However, macroprudential policy is
really a polite word describe policies of austerity.

### Redirect leftist passion to actually making a difference

I admire your passion for the problems you care about and, as a former
liberal and former socialist, I understand why these problems matter
to other people. But you need to understand financial engineering,
macroeconomics and macroprudential policy before you claim that all
problems can be solved with government. As long as we have a function
economy that works for every man and woman, great or small, we cannot
responsibly promise that new government programs when the United
States is already fiscally insolvent in 2050. It's not responsible.

Liberals & people who think that socialism isn't a dirty word -- read
these publications and take these classes. You do not understand. If
you hate Wall Street as much as you claim to, then you should learn as
much about financial engineering as possible. If American develops the
proper incentivization structure in the system, everything else will
falls into place.

If you want to understand why I hate communism, why i think it's its
own antithesis, then read the draft for my article *Our Revolution of
Empowerment* because it describes how communism and systems of
governance uncomfortably close to it actually *rob* people of the
ability to influence their society, their environment and their
personal circumstances.

### More misc

If the international leftist order ever gets control of information
across the globe (e.g. ICANN/DNS or similar institutions) they will
use them for economic warfare via information warfare. What will
happen is a slow collapse of the American economy into
subservience. They will bait American economic players into making bad
decisions by controlling the information we are exposed to. So, for
example, if China ever develops an ungodly amount of influence in
American politics, they will use it to micromanage sectors/players in
the American economy, forcing us to misallocate resources and
preparing us for our new communist overlords.

Americans, who have been in control of the global reserve currency for
nearly four generations have **no idea** what it will feel like to be
subservient to foreign economic interests. As a nation who's mostly
tapped her natural resources, *we will be fucking screwed**

the ideals that you're supporting as politicians and leftists support
them require a transfer of ownership to a globalist system with UBI,
which is expensive and unnecessary. you're on the wrong side and such
a revolution transfer towards socialist ideas at this time would be
disastrous for american interests.

Our basic needs will become cheaper and cheaper. However, the
inevitable final transition of the global economy during the
Singularity is to a system of serfs with a tiny slice of power players
enjoying all ownership of intellectual property, real estate and
production.

Who do you want to be in charge, the people who laid the basis of
rationalism and accumulated dozens of generations of wisdom to
architect a system that enabled economic expansion and scientific
discovery? Or do you want to support a last minute revolution to
entrust power into the hands of people with less than a single
generation of experience?

Because regardless of whether we go left or right, WE WILL ALL BECOME
SERFS WITH NO MEANS OF RISING ABOVE ANY OTHER PERSON. There is no
other endgame scenario except global collapse. So, at this point, the
argument is about WHO is in control, as we launch towards the
Singularity. Because transition to such a system is inevitable.

*if I have to make a choice*, I would strongly prefer fascism over
communism because it doesn't require change of ownership across the
board via forced revolution -- which is expensive in terms of
opportunity cost on the global stage, economically and
politically. Also, fascism, because it allows a person access to BOTH
financial and social influence mechanism, is much more likely than
communism to revert to normalcy, if there is such a hope...

We have a decision as Americans: make a hard left or a hard right. AND
IF WE MAKE A HARD LEFT, AMERICAN INTERESTS ARE DAMNED.

The idea you're talking about is like global economic convergence and
it's unstoppable, absent some climate/nuclear catastrophe. Regardless
of how it happens, there will be a very small set of people with real
power and everyone else will be mostly serfs. We will be well-pampered
serfs with higher quality of life than any other serfs in history, but
we'll be serfs with no real hope of advancement.

People don't understand that *this idea* is why i have worked so hard
to "break through" with a startup ... BECAUSE I'LL BE DAMNED IF I
DIDN'T WORK HARD ENOUGH TO AVOID ENDING A SERF.
