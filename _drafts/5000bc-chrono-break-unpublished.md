### Chrono Break

- an extension to some of the ideas in 5000bc on reincarnation mixed
  with some of the ideas from "ground control to dr. strange"

whoever controls the past controls the future
- so instead of ideas that add onto existing ideas
  - on that instead sets a point in pre-history (proto-ICV & the
    arch-mage)
  - this establishes a point before most existing belief systems
- in that way, this allows a general(!) belief system to change how
  those are interpreted by changing their significance
  - this is just an idea. it is not what i intended to do at the
    outset. if it does so, it should do so in a way that doesn't
    interfere with those existing belief systems
- ideas that some people are reincarnated and some stay in some kind
  of afterlife.
  - coupled with the idea that all times are occuring simultaneously
    - and there is an "overmind" or a superbeing that we are all
      connected to. this ~= parallels God but is not the totality of
      God
      - this also parallels the idea of Brahma
  - so there's this idea that all beings are receiving their
    experience simultaneously through their connection to this
    overmind being and this is coupled to the idea that all times are
    occuring simultaneously. but there is still causality from the
    past to the present to the future.
    - therefore, the future can affect the past, but then those
      changes set us on a different stream of time and thus to a
      different future.
    - but all times occur simultaneously and some people can remain in
      the afterlife and some beings can be called down and/or
      reincarnated into the minds of people for special purposes or
      when a person reaches a level of spiritual development.
      - when it's a result of spiritual development, this can mean
        that the person has perfectly recreated that aspect (the form
        of that being's spirit & mind)
        - or it could mean other things
  - if it is true that someone's mind could be non-local or augmented
    by something non-local (either consciousness is forked into a
    non-local host or a consciousness connects into our minds from
    some plane above or a consciousness breaks free of time and acts
    extemporaneously)
    - then there's the possibility that some of the memory related to
      that experience would be non-local as well.
    - the problem with this being commonly known is that if people
      know it (or understand how things like this work) then that
      means they could fake it for their own advantage
      - therefore there are many good-natured reasons for keeping
        knowledge secret, even though it may generally not be a good
        idea
- the person who's soul is reincarnated
  - this maybe be seen at birth.
