mention teilhard de chardin and the fate of the universe
- (explain these ideas in more depth)
- is it a hot end? much more interesting!
  - this means that the lifetime of a universe is likely cyclical by
    nature. an eternal cycle of big crunch followed by big bang
- is it a cold end? more more boring

but what if the physical doesn't matter as much as we think it does

- it's turtles all the way down (and up too)

It's a vertical metaverse. It's possible this could permit parametric
variation in any dimension, implying the potential simultaneous
existence of all possible realities. Many of these could be
transversible, assuming the universes were bridged in some way.

- the metaverse as a spongelike mass of universes connected through
  multiversal pathways
  - anchor points that moor portholes as windows to other worlds
    - can use the portholes to differentiate your current universe to
      another within reach of a porthole's neighborhood (or ball)
- this all implies that the metaverse has it's own metaphysical omneity
  - a common form shared with all multiverses and universes
  - a branching form merging with connected multiverses in some region
  - a total form containing everything
- what questions should we ask about the nature of the metaverse?
  - what mechanisms

### information representaion efficiency (in terms of energy/structure)

in other words, how much information can our physical universe
represent and simulate. is there actually any limit?
- can we can virtualize universes that can store more information than
  it would take to represent them.

the main question is:
- what is the ratio of information storage capacity of one universe as
  compared to the complexity of universes stemming from it?
  - if this is very, very high, then one can be pretty sure that the
    multiverse is complex
  - if it is sorta high, but not enough to simulate a complete
    universe with the quantum particles available in one galaxy, then
    one can assume the potential to stem universes from our own is
    fairly limited
  - if it is equal to one, then the the metaverse is 'linear' (it's just like
    the more traditional multiverse)
  - if it is less than one, then that's a major bummer, because it
    pretty much means that nothing our universe can simulate could
    compare to the complexity of the host universe.
    - and it implies that the metaverse is just the universe itself
      and all the limited simulated universes contained within it

The reasoning here is: if it's turtles all the way down, then why not
turtles all the way up?  Why would we assume that we're the turtle on
top? and yet, it's not just turtles up and down, it's turtles
branching outwards in every direction.

> Ground control to Doctor Strange.

### This was new to me

(This is all completely new for me, by the way)

- changing from a world determined by the material to one determined
  by the metaphysical
  - which is yet another reason why god is more relevant tomorrow
    - information becomes much more important

a physical manisfestation of the self-similar, physical embedding our
image of the metaphysical and radiating its essence to us.
- (...what exactly did i mean by this?)

a physical manisfestation of the self-similar reflection of the
metaphysical. (i.e. CPU's are basically a reflection of logic from
metaphysical structures into physical)



if there are ways of "traveling" between different universes in the
metaverse, then how are they linked together such that the inviolable
laws of nature hold.
- each universe in the metaverse represents different timepoints and
  states of the universe. (or it could)
- paths leading to divergent universes could branch out.
- so if the belief that this structure of the universe/metaverse is
  real, but it is based on the existence of constant information
  existing outside the material universe
  - then those laws must hold in each universe and there must be some
    laws of nature for the metaverse

### We'll Turn Inwards to Conquer Inner Space

- eventually we run out of things to learn about nature & science
  - as in, new scientific laws or phenomena to discover
    - or additional discovery's may take place on a much, much greater
      timescale
  - this might happen more quickly than we realize
  - there might never be another tesla or einstein
  - or long, running, intense math proofs


- the only thing left would be insights based on convolutions of human
  data or social data, etc. etc.
  - yet, as we lose our individuality to nihilism, humanity converges
    culturally
    - this might also be part of a concerted strategy for AI
      - to culturally converge after passing thru the "danger zone"
      - so that a more minified culture scales the complexity of
        computing problems back, so the benefits of hyper-intelligent
        AI are greater
  - but because of convergence, there is yet less for us to discover
    of the world.  which IMO is just incredibly depressing

how does the assumption of quantum networking relate to how these


#### forked consciousness

- forked consciousness
  - analogy about 1,000,000 virtual universes below our own physical
    universe where they are all mostly the same, except a few key
    points
  - then fork someone's consciousness and deploy into all of those
    situations simultaneously

#### gravity crystals



#### Metaverse Consciousness Crystallization

- re:zero first two episodes
  -

if one's consciousness can be mapped to universes descending from ours
- and if our universe projects those with mappings in itself,
  - then those values our consciousness maps there
    - could they be mapped back in this universe w/o additional info?
- if so, and if our universe were just descended from another, then
  couldn't we map back upwards too?
- again: turtles all the way down ... and turtles all the way up
  - depending on the constraints imposed on each universe as to how
    much
- could you "crystallize" with with metaverse? that is become one
  across all universes within some virtualized world and
  - if so, then
    - you could expect that person or consciousness to react
      similarly across some set of branches in that metaverse
      - or the entire metaverse (completely crystallized
    - are there special properties conveyed by projecting yourself as
      crystalized through branches in such a metaverse?
      - does this change with respect to relationships?
        - 2 overlapping/harmonious crystalizations of consciousness
          (mapped across a region of the metaverse)
          - could this convey circumstances of psychic behavior?
  - and also, ...? i was writing ish too fast
  - with a tree/conic-shaped view of a branch, how do you ascend and
  descend other branches? if you can connect?

### Can These Crystalline, Transplanar Metaverse Entities Run Programs

- if consciousness could attain some higher form in the crystal across a
  branch in the metaverse, then could it also pull something off like
  the metanomics probabilistic program that could ... do something.
  - crystals would form in different dimensions and could be
    viewed/grouped with structure along various combinations of
    dimensions
    - metaverse can also branch along similar combo's of dimensions
- when branched out in some dimensions the metaverse *could* have some
  (partially) continuous surfaces...
  - if so, is there some way to maintain higher-order chrystals,
    arrangements or forms based in differentiation, integration, etc
- a perfect crystal over some branch/grouping would be composed of
  repetitive or self-similar/geometric elements/groupings
- how would your mind structure itself across multiple universes
  - some parts of your mind would *neef* (no !@#$'ing idea what neef
    means)
  - would you retain all information about other consciousnesses if
    you "traveled" between them?
    - you might if you kinda sync the relevant information
    - but some information could be self contained in various
      universes/branches
      - however, this

### Crystallization traversing a metaverse resembles Closure & Scope

crystallization across branches of virtualized universes within a view
of the metaverse can resemble closures form math/programming
  - that is, information can be chained down into nested virtualized
    universes and is similar to scope.
    - but this information can be embodied by consciousness or some
      other aspect of that branch/grouping of universes.
      - so programs could operate across these things, moving state
        from various closures to the others
      - how does dependency of information present in closures change
        in thes cases because it seems like you might need to ..
        - you could rely on the information being there or build some
          information lambda-gen function and run it
      - in this case it would also need to understand how state is
        pushed across
- this transplanar shared state transversing the metaverse should
  have lots of repition in structure, including nests closures and
  shared scopes b/w branches and subgraphs of the metaverse
  - especially when there are various crystalline elements tiled
    across metaversal boundaries.
    - which are technically spaces of various kinds, though i have no
      idea which)

### Beings or Entities inhabiting the metaverse

they could either be restricted or arise from local branches or areas,
and capable of moving around locally to some degree
- or they inhabit the pure metaverse
  - that is they arise not from any individual universe, but out of
    some aspect of the metaverse itself

- (misc) does the metaverse connect upwards to the metaphysical realm?
  - that is, can you derive/map metaphysics for each universe in the
    metaverse.
    - this would be similar to how you can use one math to define
    other maths ... though apparently you can't. thanks alot Gödel.
    - am i correct on the incompleteness theorum inferences?
      - how did i get to this? are there other interesting connections
        b/w this and Gödel's I. Theorum
  - but is this "where" the metaphysical realm "is" ??

### The soul as our map to the universal collective un/conscious

- if we can view the soul in this way (as a map to the universal
  collective un/conscious)
  - then what does that say about those souls who more totally map to
    the Universal CU/CC
  - what does it say about those souls who contribute "more" unique
    nodes to the Universal CU/CC (for human culture & knowledge)?
- especially true if the achievement of "perfect" "enlightenment"
  could be taken to mean obtaining some perfect uniform mapping.
  - or special states of consciousness could mean that being's mind
    has pushed it's state outward in the metaverse to indicate some
    degree of crystallization
- are there some "realm's" accessible to the minds of each/some
  conscious beings that aren't so much part of the "physical"
  universe? in other words

if you can actually identify the... ??

could there be "beings" native moreso to the multiverse and some how
they exist out of it (or within it or around it)
- they could move around
- what types of beings would there be
  - would there be architypical beings, capable of metaversal
    trans-planar motion, manipulation, etc.
  - would there necessarily be some incarnation of that archetypical
    being in a metaverse branch/grouping?

what is the state of knowledge of some being of consciousness in other
planes/branches/etc
- how does it know what it knows when its in various branches?
  - there must be some information about information
    - and there must be some minimal kernel of the structure of information
      itself. though it may be an infinitely recurring self-similar
      identity map b/w groupings
  - this kernel of knowledge must always exist in every universe. it
    must cyclicly refer to itself, with recursion.
    - the same kernel must be accessible regardless of whether it's
      for the universe or some instantiation of consciousness in that
      universe. this is also true for the branches/groupings in the
      metaverse.
    - this nugget itself must exist everywhere. it's kind ofa cyclical
      minimal amount of information about the structure of
      information.
      - it can't be changed, across all branches
      - it may be able to be mapped and it probably has something to
        do with the definition of phi from recursive functions
        (continuous division or square roots)
        - something like the continuous fraction/roots phi definition
          can probably be bridged to group theory or category theory/
        - if this is true

- misc other roots with continous phi definition (1/3,1/4, -2)
  - these could also be tied to group theory (and in some way with
    modular arithematic possibly)
    - this is probably seen in group/ring/field behaviors and galois
      theory. i remember seeing a web or network of rings of primes

- because of this cyclical definition of the most generalized kernel
  of information structure (KIS), then should any given metaverse have all
  it's branches and/or (subgraphs where edges where, generally, each
  subgraph is minimally connected to others which all share a common
  ancester: the cyclical

#### metaverse Forms

- conic
  - graph model with a time/etc component that collapses near the
    center. can be parameterized with time or with other dimensions
  - also can collapse in the temporal dimension to channel through
    specific points of higher probability or coalescence
    - this sounds a lot like the wave function & quantum mechanics
    - but i specifically mean that the future eventualities *coalesce*
      on a *macro-scale* between various forms that can have a
      singular destination (i.e. a singular superintelligent being)
- tree
- graph
- circular

#### misc math

Are there graphs that can be defined as having a *most random*
structure. this can be set for the entire graph or just set the
- or a most random set of neighborhoods with
