- part one: Turtles All The Way
- part two: Consciousness Crystallization

mention the inspiration for this post?
- some post in june. i wasn't sure i should post this at the
  time. shaken by the magnitude

what is the metaverse?
- how is that different from a multiverse?
- how are these ideas different than the multiverse?
- what kinds of questions should we ask about the metaverse, should
  such a thing actually exist?

Way back in late 2007, I read an article which completely
revolutionized how I interpreted the Universe to a degree rarely
surpassed in my life. The article, which I can't find, considered
[Teilhard de Chardin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin)
work the
[The Phenomenon of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phenomenon_of_Man),
in context with the Singularity and the computational capacity of the
universe. It's what eventually lead me to understand the material
world's convergence towards the metaphysical. The artifacts of
information that we've created: our myths and products and brands will
begin to become more important than anything in the physical world as
the metaphysical coalesces during our approach towards the
Singularity. Whether it is the innate information at the root of our
universe or artifical information created by mankind, these phenomenae
begin to bend the physical world to themselves. No longer does the
physical world dictate the information relevant to mankind. Instead,
reality begins to coalesce around rules based on information that we
have created.

The article, perhaps similar to
[this one](http://jetpress.org/v20/steinhart.htm), discussed several
possible fates of the Universe. After reading it, for the first time
in my life, I felt like I had a concrete understanding of the meaning
of life, at least under a nominal set of conditions. One such
condition is that the universe eventually collapses into a physical
singularity. For if there is such a Big Crunch, that implies that the
computational capacity of the universe will approach infinite as the
universe collapses.  If the computational capacity for any region of
the universe is sufficiently large, a number of virtual universes can
be created within our own world, each as complex as the universe we
live in. If you think about it, a system of particles can emulate
several systems, each as complex as itself, within itself.

According to this analysis of the Phenomenon of Man in the context of
the Singularity, during the Big Crunch, we could extend a simulation
of the universe within itself, but push time infinitely beyond the
rate of time in the last few moments of the cosmic epoch that preceeds
the Big Crunch. This means that in the simulated universe, time
proceeds infinitely faster than that of time in our own universe. This
implies the lifetime of our material universe is likely cyclical by
nature: there is no beginning or end. It's all an eternal cycle of big
crunch followed by big bang, but what if all the cycles are instead
occuring simultaneously? .... An interesting thought to follow, for
sure.

However, if there is instead a Big Freeze and dark energy compels
galaxies to drift aimlessly outwards, then the universe is fated to
experience a cold, dark, boring death. It's a major bummer, but one
that could be circumvented if quantum networking is a thing and
there's a pre-existing fabric of entanglement that can be leveraged to
communicate across vast distances. In that case, each galaxy becomes
like a computational node in a vastly disconnected, forever expanding
tangle of galactic superclusters. Intelligent life the universe across
can leverage such quantum entanglement to augment the computational
capacity of the Universe such that it can support infinite simulations
beneath. In fact, there could be a cosmic economy based on the ability
of intellegent life to leverage their surroundings to contribute to
the sum of computation available.

###

What would these virtual universes be like? These could either be like
our own universe or more like a video game. They could obey any set of
rules we could imagine, but there is a most base set of laws, from
which everything emerges and to which everything must adhere,
regardless of whether those are the metaphysical rules that the
simulated universe appears to support. That is the metaphysical logic
from which everything emerges which can support logics which are
illogical. So simulated universes can be created which are nothing
like ours.

### Information Representation Efficiency

Yet, this all begs the question: what's the next level? Our own
material universe can emulate universes as complicated as itself
... so could those universes each emulate universes further beneath
itself? Maybe. If so, it would appear that it truly is turtles all the
way down! But how far does the rabbit hole go?

The answer depends on the number of universes that a universe can
simulate and how completely it can simulate them. Circuit complexity
and the physical structure of circuitry is a fascinating
subject. Circuits and processors are truly the physical
manisfestations of logic and nothing more. The most efficient form of
a circuit. Anything can be a computer. Babbage built computers in 19th
century England. An abacus is a computer that is rather manually
operated, where the RAM actualy resides in the human mind. So what's
the difference between a quantum computer and a cosmic quantum
computer? Nothing but scale.

- notes on information representation efficiency in both energy, time
  and structure required. low-energy, low-time, low-complexity
  structure is preferred.

TODO: describe the several types of possibilities for metaversal flexibility here?
===========

in other words, how much information can our physical universe
represent and simulate. is there actually any limit?
- can we can virtualize universes that can store more information than
  it would take to represent them.

the main question is:
- what is the ratio of information storage capacity of one universe as
  compared to the complexity of universes stemming from it?
  - if this is very, very high, then one can be pretty sure that the
    multiverse is complex
  - if it is sorta high, but not enough to simulate a complete
    universe with the quantum particles available in one galaxy, then
    one can assume the potential to stem universes from our own is
    fairly limited
  - if it is equal to one, then the the metaverse is 'linear' (it's just like
    the more traditional multiverse)
  - if it is less than one, then that's a major bummer, because it
    pretty much means that nothing our universe can simulate could
    compare to the complexity of the host universe.
    - and it implies that the metaverse is just the universe itself
      and all the limited simulated universes contained within it

### If It's Turtles All the Way Down, Then Why Not Up?

Yeh the thought that blew my mind: if it's turtles all the way down
and our universe can extend into infinite universes below our own,
then why would we assume that our universe is at the root of that
tree? That's rather like geocentricism, isn't it?

The reasoning here is: if it's turtles all the way down, then why not
turtles all the way up?  Why would we assume that we're the turtle on
top? And yet, it wouldn't just be turtles up and down, it's turtles
branching outwards in every direction.

> Ground Control to Dr. Strange!

but what if the physical doesn't matter as much as we think it does

It's a vertical metaverse. It's possible this could permit parametric
variation in any dimension, implying the potential simultaneous
existence of all possible realities. Many of these could be
transversible, assuming the universes were bridged in some way.

- the metaverse as a spongelike mass of universes connected through
  multiversal pathways
  - anchor points that moor portholes as windows to other worlds
    - can use the portholes to differentiate your current universe to
      another within reach of a porthole's neighborhood (or ball)
- this all implies that the metaverse has it's own metaphysical omneity
  - a common form shared with all multiverses and universes
  - a branching form merging with connected multiverses in some region
  - a total form containing everything
- what questions should we ask about the nature of the metaverse?
  - what mechanisms

### This was new to me

(This is all completely new for me, by the way)

- changing from a world determined by the material to one determined
  by the metaphysical
  - which is yet another reason why god is more relevant tomorrow
    - information becomes much more important

a physical manisfestation of the self-similar, physical embedding our
image of the metaphysical and radiating its essence to us.
- (...what exactly did i mean by this?)

a physical manisfestation of the self-similar reflection of the
metaphysical. (i.e. CPU's are basically a reflection of logic from
metaphysical structures into physical)

if there are ways of "traveling" between different universes in the
metaverse, then how are they linked together such that the inviolable
laws of nature hold.
- each universe in the metaverse represents different timepoints and
  states of the universe. (or it could)
- paths leading to divergent universes could branch out.
- so if the belief that this structure of the universe/metaverse is
  real, but it is based on the existence of constant information
  existing outside the material universe
  - then those laws must hold in each universe and there must be some
    laws of nature for the metaverse


### Degree of information overlap?


### We'll Turn Inwards to Conquer Inner Space

- eventually we run out of things to learn about nature & science
  - as in, new scientific laws or phenomena to discover
    - or additional discovery's may take place on a much, much greater
      timescale
  - this might happen more quickly than we realize
  - there might never be another tesla or einstein
  - or long, running, intense math proofs

- the only thing left would be insights based on convolutions of human
  data or social data, etc. etc.
  - yet, as we lose our individuality to nihilism, humanity converges
    culturally
    - this might also be part of a concerted strategy for AI
      - to culturally converge after passing thru the "danger zone"
      - so that a more minified culture scales the complexity of
        computing problems back, so the benefits of hyper-intelligent
        AI are greater
  - but because of convergence, there is yet less for us to discover
    of the world.  which IMO is just incredibly depressing

how does the assumption of quantum networking relate to how these








### forked consciousness

- forked consciousness
  - analogy about 1,000,000 virtual universes below our own physical
    universe where they are all mostly the same, except a few key
    points
  - then fork someone's consciousness and deploy into all of those
    situations simultaneously

### gravity crystals

- discussing & providing visualization for gravity crystals is
  important for the average person to abstract the idea of a crystal
  from matter to less physical things
  - gravity crystals are impossible in a finite universe, AFAIK
  - that's not what the paper says though, but gravity has a speed of
    propagation and there is no finitely tiled "gravity crystal" that
    wouldn't break down (AFAIK...)

### "Mind Form"

If you could visualize someone's mind, what would it look like? How
would you organize the information? How would it look when compared
with another person's mind using the same strategy for visualization?
If you were going to imagine applying this to small/large groups of
people, how would you go about that?

The idea of visualizing or modeling someone's mind is important for
the following ideas on consciousness crystalization (TODO: so i should
maybe explain a little better than above)

#### Consciousness Crystallization Across the Metaverse

- re:zero first two episodes
  - explain how the main character is lacksidaisically the same,
    regardless of what happens. she responds to similar situations,
    regardles of who initiates them (or something .. i donno i really
    need to watch it again)

if one's consciousness can be mapped to universes descending from ours
- and if our universe projects those with mappings in itself,
  - then those values our consciousness maps there
    - could they be mapped back in this universe w/o additional info?
- if so, and if our universe were just descended from another, then
  couldn't we map back upwards too?
- again: turtles all the way down ... and turtles all the way up
  - depending on the constraints imposed on each universe as to how
    much
- could you "crystallize" with with metaverse? that is become one
  across all universes within some virtualized world and
  - if so, then
    - you could expect that person or consciousness to react
      similarly across some set of branches in that metaverse
      - or the entire metaverse (completely crystallized
    - are there special properties conveyed by projecting yourself as
      crystalized through branches in such a metaverse?
      - does this change with respect to relationships?
        - 2 overlapping/harmonious crystalizations of consciousness
          (mapped across a region of the metaverse)
          - could this convey circumstances of psychic behavior?
  - and also, ...? i was writing ish too fast
  - with a tree/conic-shaped view of a branch, how do you ascend and
  descend other branches? if you can connect?

### Can These Crystalline, Transplanar Metaverse Entities Run Programs

- if consciousness could attain some higher form in the crystal across a
  branch in the metaverse, then could it also pull something off like
  the metanomics probabilistic program that could ... do something.
  - crystals would form in different dimensions and could be
    viewed/grouped with structure along various combinations of
    dimensions
    - metaverse can also branch along similar combo's of dimensions
- when branched out in some dimensions the metaverse *could* have some
  (partially) continuous surfaces...
  - if so, is there some way to maintain higher-order chrystals,
    arrangements or forms based in differentiation, integration, etc
- a perfect crystal over some branch/grouping would be composed of
  repetitive or self-similar/geometric elements/groupings
- how would your mind structure itself across multiple universes
  - some parts of your mind would *neef* (no !@#$'ing idea what neef
    means)
  - would you retain all information about other consciousnesses if
    you "traveled" between them?
    - you might if you kinda sync the relevant information
    - but some information could be self contained in various
      universes/branches
      - however, this

### Crystallization traversing a metaverse resembles Closure & Scope

crystallization across branches of virtualized universes within a view
of the metaverse can resemble closures form math/programming
  - that is, information can be chained down into nested virtualized
    universes and is similar to scope.
    - but this information can be embodied by consciousness or some
      other aspect of that branch/grouping of universes.
      - so programs could operate across these things, moving state
        from various closures to the others
      - how does dependency of information present in closures change
        in thes cases because it seems like you might need to ..
        - you could rely on the information being there or build some
          information lambda-gen function and run it
      - in this case it would also need to understand how state is
        pushed across
- this transplanar shared state transversing the metaverse should
  have lots of repition in structure, including nests closures and
  shared scopes b/w branches and subgraphs of the metaverse
  - especially when there are various crystalline elements tiled
    across metaversal boundaries.
    - which are technically spaces of various kinds, though i have no
      idea which)

### Beings or Entities inhabiting the metaverse

they could either be restricted or arise from local branches or areas,
and capable of moving around locally to some degree
- or they inhabit the pure metaverse
  - that is they arise not from any individual universe, but out of
    some aspect of the metaverse itself

- (misc) does the metaverse connect upwards to the metaphysical realm?
  - that is, can you derive/map metaphysics for each universe in the
    metaverse.
    - this would be similar to how you can use one math to define
    other maths ... though apparently you can't. thanks alot Gödel.
    - am i correct on the incompleteness theorum inferences?
      - how did i get to this? are there other interesting connections
        b/w this and Gödel's I. Theorum
  - but is this "where" the metaphysical realm "is" ??

### The soul as our map to the universal collective un/conscious

- if we can view the soul in this way (as a map to the universal
  collective un/conscious)
  - then what does that say about those souls who more totally map to
    the Universal CU/CC
  - what does it say about those souls who contribute "more" unique
    nodes to the Universal CU/CC (for human culture & knowledge)?
- especially true if the achievement of "perfect" "enlightenment"
  could be taken to mean obtaining some perfect uniform mapping.
  - or special states of consciousness could mean that being's mind
    has pushed it's state outward in the metaverse to indicate some
    degree of crystallization
- are there some "realm's" accessible to the minds of each/some
  conscious beings that aren't so much part of the "physical"
  universe? in other words

if you can actually identify the... ??

could there be "beings" native moreso to the multiverse and some how
they exist out of it (or within it or around it)
- they could move around
- what types of beings would there be
  - would there be architypical beings, capable of metaversal
    trans-planar motion, manipulation, etc.
  - would there necessarily be some incarnation of that archetypical
    being in a metaverse branch/grouping?


#### If a consciousness moves across the metaverse, can this cause memory problems

- time congealed (?) memory loss in a true(suspected) spiritual experience
  as the result of reaching through the metaverse
  - and then your experience is split between multiple universes
  - those experiences be experienced by a linked/merged/forked
    consciousness, but if things occur slightly differently in each
    different universe considered, then where does the memory get
    written?
    - what is stored in the brain and what is stored in the mind?
    - does quantum mechanics provide a mechanism whereby this
      information can be shared across all universes, some universes,
      etc? (more on this topic is discuss in the next section)
- assuming this metaverse stuff or something similar is possible
  (quantum mechanics seems to point to something like this) then,
  - again, if someone experiences a spiritual experience or the
    intervention of some metaversal entity (i.e. possession or having
    God speak through you) then where does the information about that
    experience get stored?
    - would some of the memory be stored in one world versus another?
    - in an experience like this, would some of it be shared across
      all universes in which the experience occured
  - if the experience actually involved time travel, how would that
    look like in this metaverse-based world?
    - if someone channeled their consciousness from the future, it
      seems like this would cause the experience of the current
      universe to be spliced into many worlds,
      - whereby the new spliced worlds that lack a path that funnels
        these worlds into back into a destined, singular reality for
        that universe fade away
        - that's because it's like a time loop spliced across the
          metaverse
        - so the paths that don't connect back never existed.
    - this is what i meant above with "time-congealed"
- double slit experiment and macro-scale quantum convergence
  - imagine the spliced world-paths described above with or without
    time travel crossing together and overlapping at several
    "gate-points"
  - this is similar to saying that these spliced world-paths overlap
    at points which are like the slits in the double slit experiment.
    - there's then these wave-functions that form around those
      interactions, but describing moreso macro-level events
      - or maybe not the macro-level events, but it's an interesting
        idea. one that's most likely not true.


#### State of Knowledge of some being of consciousness in other planes/branches/etc

- how does it know what it knows when its in various branches?
  - there must be some information about information
    - and there must be some minimal kernel of the structure of information
      itself. though it may be an infinitely recurring self-similar
      identity map b/w groupings
  - this kernel of knowledge must always exist in every universe. it
    must cyclicly refer to itself, with recursion.
    - the same kernel must be accessible regardless of whether it's
      for the universe or some instantiation of consciousness in that
      universe. this is also true for the branches/groupings in the
      metaverse.
    - this nugget itself must exist everywhere. it's kind ofa cyclical
      minimal amount of information about the structure of
      information.
      - it can't be changed, across all branches
      - it may be able to be mapped and it probably has something to
        do with the definition of phi from recursive functions
        (continuous division or square roots)
        - something like the continuous fraction/roots phi definition
          can probably be bridged to group theory or category theory/
        - if this is true

- misc other roots with continous phi definition (1/3,1/4, -2)
  - these could also be tied to group theory (and in some way with
    modular arithematic possibly)
    - this is probably seen in group/ring/field behaviors and galois
      theory. i remember seeing a web or network of rings of primes

- because of this cyclical definition of the most generalized kernel
  of information structure (KIS), then should any given metaverse have all
  it's branches and/or (subgraphs where edges where, generally, each
  subgraph is minimally connected to others which all share a common
  ancester: the cyclical

#### metaverse Forms

- conic
  - graph model with a time/etc component that collapses near the
    center. can be parameterized with time or with other dimensions
  - also can collapse in the temporal dimension to channel through
    specific points of higher probability or coalescence
    - this sounds a lot like the wave function & quantum mechanics
    - but i specifically mean that the future eventualities *coalesce*
      on a *macro-scale* between various forms that can have a
      singular destination (i.e. a singular superintelligent being)
- tree
- graph
- circular


### Consciousness Crystallization within a Single Universe

a similar form of consciousness crystallization can occur within a
single universe. this is what happens with religion, actually.  with
respect to religion, the crystallization is rarely tiled with the same
kind of nodes. most religions promote social institutions which
involve various kinds of roles.

- expand on these ideas

### crystallization and time travel

if someone achieves some known state of mind that
- satisfies some conditions/properties/responses
  - in some deterministic way
  - or non-deterministic, but acceptably variant way
- then that persons consciousness can travel through to the past or
  future and the consequences could be "known" at least to some degree
  - or the variance might be controllable or predictable so that the
    outcome can be corrected via expecting the difference
  - but really, it works best when you can expect that the outcome is
    the same. otherwise it probably could diverge significantly
  - so you could connect to previous lives or with the consciousness
    of someone who's mind is addressable for some reason. i.e. for
    some reason it's readibly accessible at that time/place for yours
    to connect.
    - one could establish ritualistic protocols of interactions that
      strengthen the quantum connectivity to encourage connections
      from the future ... somehow
    - so it's like a device or some kind of drug that enables your
      mind to connect back from the future. or would allow your
      successor to connect back from the future
      - in this way, you would choose a succession of consciousnesses
        that would be able to link back from generations ahead to your
        own consciousness
        - while keeping some specific key private or something
      - to establish this in particular, you'd need to ensure that you
        can propagate the mind-form that can link back to the past
        - so, you're basically trying to design some self-sustaining
          crystalized mind-form that will always be able to maintain
          that propagation of mind-form.
        - because, as long as you can always depend on it being
          similar enough and is linkable, then you can ensure that
          there will be something that connects back from the future,
          even if it's another person's consciousness
- the consciousness instead might merge with another person or vessel
  from another time or place.
  - a vessel, as in, perhaps a burning bush...... uhhh not really though
  - this vessel might be something expects a specific mind-form or
    uses some interface. in other articles, i've described a universal
    language and protocol, but interfaces would need to be built on
    top of this ... and that's when the universiality breaks down a
    bit
  - this could be an android across the galaxy with a quantum
    networking interface or some alien life form
    - probably impossible, but maybe you could link in and passively
      or actively observe.

### using your brain to find your zero point

e.g. meditation utilizing some mechanics to encourage your mind to
identify quantum links in your brain or develop them in some way... if
this is even possible

### misc math

Are there graphs that can be defined as having a *most random*
structure. this can be set for the entire graph or just set the
- or a most random set of neighborhoods with

### projection of causality onto lower universes from external, higher universes

causality is driven from higher universes onto lower universes,
- at least at the point of conception
  - (e.g. a big-bang creation event decides initial values)
  - this is like powering on a video game console or giving birth to
    some other kind of "lower" universe
- possibly on a real-time basis
  - where entities from higher universes can influence events in a
    lower or simulated universe in real-time
    - like player one controlling a character in a video game
- possibly on an event-driven basis
  - specific events broadcast themselves to entities in higher planes
    who then choose to or must react to them.

but some of the conditions above imply causation isn't ever completely
internalized in a universe... there is always some external influence
which may vary in its degree of continuity

- but this implies that externally-sourced causation of events is not
  final or total. that is, even if we are fated to specific events, we
  can fight that.
  - if we were damned from the point of conception in the big bang, we
    can counter that.
  - if entities from a higher universe must maintain constant
    intervention in our world, that means there must be a reason for
    that.
  - if entities from a higher plane involve themselves in our world on
    a specific event-driven basis, then we can become aware of that
    and we can counter it. or at least control our own fate.

... more here

this shared degree of causality also implies shared information
- or duplicated locatation of some information
- ... i didn't explore how or the implications on causality of options
  for how information can be duplicated or shared

### Zenith of Crystalization

- is there some zenith of crystalization? is there some mind-form
  which is perfectly synced across all possible worlds? across all
  possible virtualizations above and below our own? What would that be
  like?
