mention teilhard and the fate of the universe
- is it a hot end? much more interesting!
  - this means that the lifetime of a universe is likely cyclical by
    nature. an eternal cycle of big crunch followed by big bang
- is it a cold end? more more boring
  - this


It's a vertical metaverse. It's possible this could permit parametric
variation in any dimension, implying the potential simultaneous
existence of all possible realities. Many of these could be
transversible, assuming the universes were bridged in some way.

- the metaverse as a spongelike mass of universes connected through
  multiversal pathways
  - anchor points that moor portholes as windows to other worlds
    - can use the portholes to differentiate your current universe to
      another within reach of a porthole's neighborhood (or ball)
- this all implies that the metaverse has it's own metaphysical omneity
  - a common form shared with all multiverses and universes
  - a branching form merging with connected multiverses in some region
  - a total form containing everything
- what questions should we ask about the nature of the metaverse?
  - what mechanisms

the main question is:
- what is the ratio of information storage capacity of one universe as
  compared to the complexity of universes stemming from it?
  - if this is very, very high, then one can be pretty sure that the
    multiverse is complex
  - if it is sorta high, but not enough to simulate a complete
    universe with the quantum particles available in one galaxy, then
    one can assume the potential to stem universes from our own is
    fairly limited
  - if it is equal to one, then the the metaverse is 'linear' (it's just like
    the more traditional multiverse)
  - if it is less than one, then that's a major bummer, because it
    pretty much means that nothing our universe can simulate could
    compare to the complexity of the host universe.
    - and it implies that the metaverse is just the universe itself
      and all the limited simulated universes contained within it

the reasoning here is: if it's turtles all the way down, then why not
turtles all the way up?  why would we assume that we're the turtle on
top? and yet, it's not just turtles up and down, it's turtles
branching outwards in every direction.

(This is all completely new for me, by the way)

- changing from a world determined by the material to one determined
  by the metaphysical
  - which is yet another reason why god is more relevant tomorrow

a physical manisfestation of the
physically embedding our image of the metaphysical and radiating its
essence to us.


if there are ways of "traveling" between different universes in the
metaverse, then how are they linked together such that the inviolable
laws of nature hold.
- each universe in the metaverse represents different timepoints and
  states of the universe. (or it could)
- paths leading to divergent universes could branch out.
- so if the belief that this structure of the universe/metaverse is
  real, but it is based on the existence of constant information
  existing outside the material universe
  - then those laws must hold in each universe and there must be some
    laws of nature for the metaverse


- eventually we run out of things to learn about nature & science
  - as in, new scientific laws or phenomena to discover
    - or additional discovery's may take place on a much, much greater
      timescale
  - this might happen more quickly than we realize
  - there might never be another tesla or einstein
  - or long, running, intense math proofs
- the only thing left would be insights based on convolutions of human
  data or social data, etc. etc.
  - yet, as we lose our individuality to nihilism, humanity converges
    culturally
    - this might also be part of a concerted strategy for AI
      - to culturally converge after passing thru the "danger zone"
      - so that a more minified culture scales the complexity of
        computing problems back, so the benefits of hyper-intelligent
        AI are greater
  - but because of convergence, there is yet less for us to discover
    of the world.  which IMO is just incredibly depressing

how does the assumption of quantum networking relate to how these

#### Metaverse Consciousness Crystallization

if one's consciousness can be mapped to universes descending from ours
- and if our universe projects those with mappings in itself, then
  could those values our consciousness maps to there by mapped back in
  this universe w/o additional info?
- if so, and if our universe were just descended from another, then
  couldn't we map back upwards too?
- again: turtles all the way down ... and turtles all the way up
  - depending on the constraints imposed on each universe as to how
    much
- could you "crystallize" with with metaverse? that is become one
  across all universes within some virtualized world and
  - if so, then
    - you could expect that person or consciousness to react
      similarly across some set of branches in that metaverse
      - or the entire metaverse (completely crystallized
    - are there special properties conveyed by projecting yourself as
      crystalized through branches in such a metaverse?
      - does this change with respect to relationships?
        - 2 overlapping/harmonious crystalizations of consciousness
          (mapped across a region of the metaverse)
          - could this convey circumstances of psychic behavior?
  - and also, ...?
  - with a tree/conic-shaped view of a branch, how do you ascend and
  descend other branches? if you can connect?

#### Metaverse Forms

  - conic
    - graph model with a time/etc component that collapses near the
      center. can be parameterized with time or with
  - tree
  - graph
  - circular
