- i don't need this much detail on NK in the SoT series, but may write
  about options/analysis in NK

### North Korea as a global minimum of connectivity (from speed of thought 2)

- how this leads to poor decisions by the leadership and reduces their
  economic competitiveness
  - if you look at the social graph, the 2-degree neighborhoods of
    north korean citizens have fewer international connections than
    any other country.
    - how can you compete in the global economy if your regime
      prohibits communiction with the outside?
    - how can you export products if your citizens cannot freely
      establish relationships with people and businesses in other
      countries? in spite of UN sanctions, the regime really shoots
      their potential development of exports (in the foot)
    - in a digital economy, products are informational. NK citizens
      simply can't be consumers or producers of content. AFAIK, they
      aren't allowed to have radios because NK paranoia is stuck with
      the 1960's soviet mindset of information control.
      - no hardware for internet, no media creation tools, no content
        production, no culture export, no connections developed,
        interactions are discouraged.
      - essentially, you snuffed your country's ability to participate
        in a digital economy in the crib. isolation is the incredibly
        damaging. i should know.
      - this has always been true and interconnection becomes more
        valuable as we approach the singularity.
      - but, with NK policy as it is, they can't build these
        economically beneficial relationships in an increasingly
        digital world bc it means their citizens would inevitably be
        exposed to information from the outside. their leadership has
        painted themselves into a corner because their long term
        strategy was developed in the 40's(in china), 50's and 60's
        w/o much understanding of how networking technology would
        change the world.
        - in context with their leadership's propaganda and narrative,
          this has sealed their fate. they either *never* develop or
          they do and information seeps in. once that happens, their
          people will see their leadership for what it is.
      - all of NK's policy was centered around importation of marxist
        ideas from china and unfounded paranoia of western imperialism
      - for NK marxists, it would have been much wiser to have *never*
        fought the korean war... but they couldn't have known that i
        guess.
- the great firewall of china can't restrict completely the diffusion
  of information, though it is fairly effective. the chinese language
  lends itself more efficient and more effective indexing of online
  content and discussion.

### The North Korean Calendar as an example of creating an artificial boundary

- From Speed of Thought 3

- North Korea's Juche calendar oddly carries an air of religious
  significance in a nation that embraces marxism and its atheist
  tendencies. Still, they detest imperialism and have essentially
  established a monarchy, so it's not the only contradictory aspect of
  an ideology concocted in complete isolation.
  - what else does the Juche Calendar do? It creates an artificial
    division b/w the interior and exterior, which molds the citizen's
    minds to conceptualized historical events and attribute them to
    Juche years.
  - while calendar systems specific to religious traditions or
    cultures are common, the North Korean calendar system further
    divorce's its citizens conceptualization of history from that of
    the rest of the world.
    - so, inner track propaganda establishes awareness of history in
      terms of Juche years and makes it difficult for information
      about history of the "outer realm" which has managed to
      penetrate into the isolated country to establishe relevance. it
      is mind control and is actually an example of Juche philosophy's
      bizarre conception of german idealism and subject/object --
      essentially "we're wrong and we do not give a fuck".  penetrate
      into the isolated country.
    - ![picture of the outer realm from Mortal Kombat]())
  - the creation of this calendar system signifies the epoxification
    of north korea's intent to NEVER let its citizens become aware of
    the outside world. in every way and in every facet of life, Kim
    Il-Sung and the original usurpers of North Korea abused the
    conception of flawed ideology and concocted a long-term strategy
    to be executed over the course of several generations *WHICH THEY
    ALWAYS KNEW WOULD BE NECESSARILY TRAUMATIC AND ISOLATORY FOR THER
    CITIZENS*.
    - i don't believe this is a common motivation for establishing a
      calendar system, but most calendar systems have endured over a
      thousand years. THANK GOD THE JUCHE SYSTEM WILL NOT.
