- discover about variations in dopplershift that correlate from our motion in relation to massive objects
  - arstechnica article
- thought experiment: 2 massive objects moving away from each other
  - really need to create some pics for this kind of stuff

ideas: 

- viewing astrophysical observations in the universe as streams of information
  - that is imagine not just the star as a "star," instead imagine it as a stream of photons
  - and likewise for gravity: imagine it as a stream of information from another object with mass
    - this information only has an effect once it reaches the other side

- what are the implications for technology once relativistic effects are overcome?


assuming the path of a gamma ray burst was not altered by the gravity wave, which it almost certainly would, then both would not reach us with the same time interval they started with.

- is there a distinction between gravity and the space it curves? or is gravity literally a ripple in space? 
- would high levels of gravity cause the path of gravitation itself to curve, similar to how the path of light curves? 
- if gravity travels at the speed of light and force is mass, and if all matter exhibits gravitational force on all other matter, then what happens to the gravitational energy between 2 massive objects moving away from each other, whose gravitational energy takes significant time to reach the other object? 
- would space curve for the objects in between, even though the source of gravitational energy may be unclear?

- article on dark matter, gravity and relativity
  - specifically, is the speed of light truly constant for all conditions
    - light is composed of particle waves flowing through space
      - if space curves, light appears to curve, but the flow of light doesn't affect the medium
        - for the most part, the mass of energy flowing through space as photons
          - doesn't affect the structure of space.
      - however, if light is flowing in sync with a gravity wave,
        - the gravity wave [supposedly] flows at the speed of light
          - but distorts the structure of spacetime itself as it propagates
        - therefore it would alter the apparent speed of light flowing in the same direction
        - possibly(??) causing that light to *appear* to travel 
          - at slightly less/slightly more than c
   - if this is true, or if something similar is true, and c is not universally constant
     - but instead c varies from apparent c, dependent on the structure of space,
     - then what is c, really?
     - and how does this affect other laws of physics?
       - which are dependent on c? are they actually dependent on local/apparent c?
     - and how does this affect the conclusions we've reached using statistic modeling of the cosmos?
   - it's probably not tru to begin with (i don't knwo all the mathematic complexities)
     - however, it's interesting to thing that something so fundamental as the constant nature of c
       - may not be so constant
     - and it's an interesting thought experiment to examine the dependencies of theories in physics
       - if X, changes how does that affect theories based on X?  etc..

    - .... or maybe not .. the point here was to create streams of photons generated from the same location

i’m not a physicist, but the nature of gravity waves is different than quantum waves in that gravity affects the medium through which it propagates. so if that’s true, then how could the trajectory and velocity of a gamma ray burst not be altered? unless there’s some weird balance between the energy dispersed by a gravity wave on the objects around it and the trajectory/momentum of those objects.

assuming they’re both moving in the same direction at the same speed, different phenomena could arise, based on their relative positions. a different result would occur if the gamma ray burst were well in front of the wave, on its crest, on its trough or well behind it.

thought experiment: focus on a star just on the edge of the sun. like the original experiment proving relativity. if the suns gravity were to increase quickly, the trajectory of the light from that star would change. it would appear slightly further away from the sun.

now consider 3 equidistant parallel light rays emerging orthogonally from a large-bodied object like the sun. r0 is the center ray, r1 and r2 are the outer, equidistant rays. now increase gravity at the source. assuming symmetry, those same parallel rays should bend inwards intersect at a point far away from the star, but at different times since they travelled different distances. ray r0 should be further outward than r1 & r2, since it had a straight path. r1 & r2 will intersect the path of r0 at the same time, since everything is symmetric.

p0: the origin of ray r0. p1: the intersection point on r0 of rays r1 and r2. p2: the position of a photon on ray r0 when r1 and r2 intersect.

this is getting more complicated than i intended. it really helps to visualize these light rays as paths, instead of traveling photons. now increase gravity again and p1 is closer to the star. the proportion of p2/p0 to p1/p0 has increase. decrease gravity and that proportion decreases

if you then visualize an idealized gravity wave propagating along with these rays, it would cause p1 to be closer, then farther from the star as it increased/decreased gravity. assuming the gravity wave and photons are traveling at c, the speed of light, then a gravity wave likely won’t both increase & decrease gravity for a single photon, unless that photon’s path is significantly curved by the wave in relation to the direction of the gravity wave. it’s tricky because gravity and light move at c and so any effect is minute.

i’m rambling at this point, but i think this is a useful thought experiment for understanding how gravity affects space, even though it’s a bit idealized. yet, after thinking about this, it just seems that gravity waves would break some kind of invariance in relativity, or at least my understanding of it. for a gamma ray burst with all photons moving parallel with a gravity wave, wouldn’t the distribution of photons in that beam show a doppler shift? they definitely would, if the photons were not all moving parallel with the gravity wave. what i mean by a break in invariance is it’s odd that just because a photon is moving exactly in line with a gravity wave, it wouldn’t exhibit any effect at all on it.
