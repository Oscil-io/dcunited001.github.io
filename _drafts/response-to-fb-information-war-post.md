- I made one-liner comment, but got called out for it, then reconsidered
  and decided to actually contribute.
  - i'd like to take these articles and rehash them into another to
    focus more closely on the dangers of information warfare


- why attempting to quantify information structure/dynamics/diffusion,
  along with sociophysical models and game theory leads to drastically
  different philosophical conclusions about the significance of
  information.
  - if you don't understand what i'm writing about, then it's easy to
    assume that a worldview based on a subjective-but-passionate
    understanding of some ideology (i.e. humanism or marxism) is
    sufficient for dictating or restraining policy.
  - if you don't understand this content (and it isn't easy) then you
    don't actually understand enough about life, society and, in
    particular, human behavior to predict how policy will affect
    people.
    - if your a passionate humanist and your goal is to help people,
      wouldn't it be useful to understand people, group dynamics, game
      theory to inform your political views?
    - if it's important to you to actually achieve the lofty goals and
      ideals that drive your passion, then you absolutely have to
      understand this subject, otherwise you are forever at a
      disadvantage, unware that you are a piece in someone else's
      game, a leaf blowing about in a windstorm.
- you might be a well-reasoned person living in a land of milk and
  honey who wishes for only the alleviation of human suffering, but
  the world is not full of sunshine and rainbows. life is a game and
  there are many players.
  - if your values and ideals are worth hard work and sacrifice to
    attain, then you have to understand how the other players in this
    game will react to you.

- information economics and sociophysical aspects of information
  - why are these mathematical frameworks/solutions almost always
    incomputable
    - understanding that, how do you quantify what can be modeled or
      known? and how do you structure your processes and behaviors to
      collect data to efficiently model information dynamics and
      social phenomena

- the dynamics of content production/consumption in a converging or
  converged world
  - this is where the [somewhat poorly organized] articles paradox of
    creativity and death of creativity are relevant


- autonomous agents and containers of information
  - how information moves, replicates and mutates
  - in the past, information could be totally restricted by physically
    restricting the vessel(s) of that information.
    - how this changes with a completely connected world where
      information can be freely reproduced at zero cost

- the semiotics of information, content, media, art, culture,
  language, society, etc.
  - particularly, the distribution of information about symbols
    (signifiers) among people
  - moving forward into more connected societies, how brand
    recognition, content awareness, etc is fundamentally more
    difficult to create/maintain.
    - it is more expensive, possibly prohibitively expensive to market

- agents and vessels of information structure
  representations/references to information
  - these references can be understood in many different dimensions
    - geographically: where does the information exist, physically? it
      matters
    - in aggregate: how many references are there to the information?
      - how is it distributed?
    - why is the information relevant to people?
  - information is diffused primarily through communication networks:
    IRL, social media, etc.
    - can also be diffused through other representations, some of
      which are phsycial: billboard ads, street art, stickers, ...
    - recently, non-human agents like bots can be automated and
      controlled to influence people.
      - this is cheap, difficult to trace to a person
  - but more of our information is delivered through some virtual
    network built on top of the internet, often managed by a newsfeed
    algorithm

- these information representations are linked to abstract semiotic
  signs, which people interpret individually.
  - the democratization of content production along with diminshing
    economic opportunities will lead to overload of content
  - (move insights from below on how this creates unmarketable
    cultural noise that prevents semiotic interpretations from being
    created/managed)

- this content overload makes it increasingly complicated to
  understand/predict how information will be interpreted.
  - further, the economics and inability to market information render
    it difficult for authorities or institutions to respond *to a
    culture that is evolving exponentially faster*
  - it's just important to see this coming, so that we can respond to
    it now with an understanding of what technocultural turbulence
    will be like before we encounter it.

- for example, in the 50's when there were three TV channels,
  - (1) how efficiently could we deliver a message to the american people?
  - (2) how confidently could we be that they recognized the language of
    symbols used in that communication in some predictable way?
  - for the first issue, there are answers that have already been
    implemented. there are SMS notification services for emergencies.
    - however, i'm not worried about instantaneous notification in an
      emergency.
    - () how can any group leverage communication channels for general
      purposes *in a predictable way* when there are exponentially
      many channels, many of which are algorithmically controlled
      - machine learning algorithms can't be indexed
    - the exponential expansion and variety of channels (in the purest
      sense of the word) create a situation where it becomes difficult
      or prohibitively expensive to inform and relate to the general
      public
  - that takes care of the first question above, which is trivial to
    anticipate. the second issue is much more complicated. through
    communication and consumption of information, individuals in
    society create their own understanding of how symbols, called
    signifiers in semiotics, map to the concepts they signify.
    - if you want to predict how an individual or group will respond
      to messaging, you need to know how they interpret the language
      you use to convey your ideas.
      - some of this language is textual or verbal
      - much of it, particularly the strongest signaling, uses
        language that trigger associations with imagery.
        - it's harder for people to understand these associations
          because sometimes they are subconscious.
    - effective communications leverages this language of symbols that
      are inculcated through a common, shared experience. that's what
      allows marketers to be confident they will provoke a strong,
      emotional reaction.
      - but if you take away the homogeny of symbols, it's difficult
        to predict how usage of these ad hoc languages of imagery will
        affect recipients.
        - in marketing, you want to nudge the recipient along a
          decision tree by leveraging associations that make your
          product pitch more appealing or even relevant. you might
          also use vivid imagery to create a strong first impression
          of your brand.
        - in public relations, when trying to unify a country full of
          people fighting over issues provoked by foreign influence,
          is it easier or harder for institutions to appeal to
          citizens to react uniformly? no, it's exponentially more
          complicated because the influence any one channel can
          project is limited AND the language of imagery has been
          diluted.
      - without prediction and quantification, one can't ... public
        relations strategies makes it difficult to design...

- constant inculcation of a fairly homogenous set of symbols

- what the fuck is the deep state?
  - perfect example of imagery that is being remapped so that it
    doesn't cohere to any dominant interpretation

- everything is a wave
  - social phenomena can be modeled with social physics, but almost
    everything is incomputable.
  - however, similar to how there are many kinds of interactions
    between particles and waves, interactions in social physics can be
    understood with infinite dimensional waves
    - however, the structure of information infinite and unknowable

- understanding this and reacting to the situation early, in
  anticipation of information warfare
  - why is all warfare essentially information warfare?
  - what is usually meant by information warfare?
    - competition over information and its distribution to influence
      the behavior of groups
      - these groups can be larger scale: social, political, military
      - and smaller scale: units of troops or insurgents, individuals
        suspected of espionage, departments in a corporation
      - typically, the more surgical the targeting, the less
        information is created as a result.
    - the definition of "information warfare" blurs with ideas from
      PR, communications, marketing and branding, which are
      essentially objective competition over information and its
      distribution
      - but if used in a military sense, often implies achieving some
        tactically or strategically relevant change in behavior by
        creating, distorting, diffusing, etc. information
    - information warfare is distinct from other forms of war in many
      different ways, including that information can be created and is
      much more difficult to destroy.
      - in economic warfare, you're competing over resources,
        opportunities and relationships which are exchanged
      - in armed conflict, you and your adversary have more clearly
        defined resources which can be created, moved, destroyed, etc.
        - these resources, at least at a higher level, are more
          clearly defined and quantified.
      - also, it's important to distinguish that these resources can
        be clearly added/removed from the conflict, whereas
        information is everywhere and is created as a result of
        changes in the environment, the action of people or autonomous
        agents, etc.
        - it's something that is created everywhere by everything, but
          isn't so easily destroyed.
        - information may be more fundamental to the universe than
          matter. it is thought to be preserved by black holes, etc.
        - but information has a life of its own and is difficult to to
          restrict its diffusion without either coercing the container
          of information or destroying it entirely
  - some examples of tactics in information warfare
    - most techniques from marketing or branding
    - restricting diffusion of information, generally or from specific
      groups of people
    - manipulating the presentation of information
  - when is outright information warfare advantageous?
    - when the adversary is strong:
      - they are more capable of pushing a large volume of information
        (information flux)
      - they are more likely to be perceived as credible
      - they can react quickly and powerfully in the short term
      - they can be more confident about the permanence of their
        long-term narratives
      - because their information is dominant, people default to
        usually comparing other information to the default worldview
    - when the adversary is weak:
      - they can influence the strong, without overt warfare, and
        promote narratives counter to short & long-term objectives of
        their enemies
      - this is particularly effective in the long-term when they can
        establish information/narratives to be used later on that, at
        the time, don't seem threatening or the adversary's goal is
        not obvious
        - when the weak adversary gains strength, the information they
          pushed subversively can become more useful.
    - when the boundaries of a country's communication networks are
      porous and highly connected this is both an advantage and
      disadvantage

  - boundaries of communication networks in information warfare
    - when the boundaries are more tightly locked down:
      - there are negative aspects:
        - it becomes harder to establish relationships with the
          outside
        - your population's understanding of the world becomes skewed
          and it is very easy to make long-term strategic blunders
          - the everyday people and the leadership are detached from
            reality and unware of trends and options.
        - economically and politically, you are at an incredible
          disadvantage.
          - it is typically harder to engage in free trade without
            restrictions or government regulation
          - it's easier for trade partners to discover
            products/relationships in societies that are not closed
      - there are benefits in the long-term:
        - because your adversaries or other neutral players have not
          been able to diffuse information into your society with much
          proficiency, the logical copies of information within the
          minds of your population are fewer in number and much weaker
          in proportion to alternative information
          - so, therefore, it's easier to suppress information you
            don't like because *it never took root at all*
          - also, you just never have to deal with it. information
            contrary to the mainstream almost doesn't exist.
          - many countries seem to prefer this because they don't want
            information they can't control to disrupt or dilute their
            culture, which is something that many Westerners don't
            understand or even find offensive.
            - these countries may be trying to protect their cultural
              identity in the long-term. if they open their doors with
              no restrictions, then foreigners with more money and
              power will control what information becomes dominant.
        - IMO, these few benefits are grossly outweighed by the lost
          economic opportunities. these are things that mostly benefit
          people in power in those countries, but also can be an
          attempt to preserve cultural identity in spite of
          modernization

- narrative of american interventionalist foreign policy as being
  evil, self-serving and (etc..)
  - by the way, i don't believe this narrative and find it to be
    offensive. policy and politics are never simple, especially when
    it comes to conflict. the same action can be interpreted in many
    ways, but i believe quite the opposite of this narrative. i
    believe that we stand up for human rights, civil rights and
    justice in the world. i believe we have used our power responsibly
    for the greater good and we have done so to defend freedom,
    justice and economic development around the world. i also believe
    that a dominant force that doesn't exercise it's power without
    restraint or reason will inevitably destabalize itself. in the
    later 20th century, we were lucky to have America as a superpower
    willing to stand up because Soviet Communism was destined to
    require an empire to sustain itself economically.
  - this is an example of an application of information warfare. in
    the short-term, it has disrupted our response in the beginning of
    the War on Terror
    - it demoralized the public and prevented us from acting in unison
      to support our military.
    - it resulted in a political swing to the left b/w 2004-2008
  - in the long-term, if america were to cede its superpower status,
    this narrative may become dominant. a dominant power could use
    narrative like a page in a coloring book to paint the united
    states foreign policy as evil
    - as a dominant power, they would be able to build on top of this
      and distort it however they want to keep us in check.
    - if the narrative wasn't a defining component of so many
      citizens' worldviews, then our enemies wouldn't have the
      opportunity to build on top of it in the future.
      - i personally don't believe the narrative at all and think the
        opposite, with maybe a few exceptions, is true. america is a
        force for good in the world.

- ... or wasn't a primary factor empassioning liberals to encourage
  demoralization

#### [Paradox of Creativity](http://te.xel.io/posts/2016-05-16-the-paradox-of-creativity.html)

here's an essay on the death of novelty and originality as the limits
on information diffusion are annihilated by the singularity. the
information overload, particularly its skewed nature, results in
generations of people who are completely severed from the past. if we
understand this moving forward, we can use social engineering to
preserve the pieces of our identity and culture which will otherwise
be completely lost.

#### [Death of Creativity](http://te.xel.io/posts/2016-05-17-the-death-of-creativity.html)

here's an essay on how the death of novelty/originality
(i.e. creativity) leads to a complete connected, converged culture
full of creative people who can't produce anything that is
distinguishable. all cultural artifacts at that point will be
essentially noise, where no artifacts develop a significant or
marketable following among content producers or consumers.

this is worrying because, from a perspective informed by semiotics and
distribution/recognition of symbols, there are no IP's or new content
that can cultivate a following, no matter how large the marketing
budget. if content is king, content production tools are democratized
and content is the only content most people can monetize, but
fundamentally can *neither* be marketed affordably *nor* effectively,
then all of it is meaningless and everything is noise.

because of this and because our culture, language and society depends
so heavily on patterns of recognizable symbols for social engineering,
pattern languages and cultural programming, this ends in disaster
because each of these three things become much less capable of
functioning without semiotic recognition/distribution of symbols.

### in summary

the future is a desolate wasteland of cultural noise, full of cheap
recombinations of the same shit that nobody recognizes. except Star
Wars because Star Wars can afford a billion dollar budget. but nothing
in this future is significant.

what does that mean for information warfare? we are not ready for it
at all. this creates a situation where a strong, powerful adversary
can exert influence over networking/telecom/media/etc to close it
down. it creates a situation where the dynamics, tactics and
strategies of information warfare shift beneath our feet when people
are so distracted by the social media circus they don't see it coming.

best of all, bc of the shady Russian shit, LIBERALS FINALLY HAVE TO
ACCEPT THAT FOREIGN INFLUENCE CAN INJECT INCREDIBLY DEMORALIZING
INFLUENCES ON OUR SOCIETY. they can undermine our decisions, determine
our policy and convince us to tear ourselves apart.
