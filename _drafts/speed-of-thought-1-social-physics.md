- thesis for part one:
  - the world today differs fundamentally because of converged nature
    of communication networks
    - essentially, communication was formerly bound by social physics,
      but these physical limitations no longer constrain information
    - social physics is still relevant and important to understand,
      especially when/if information networks are disrupted.
  - old ideas that were more difficult to understand become visible
    and undeniable

### What Is The Speed of Thought Today?

Impulses between neurons can travel over 100 meters per second. These
impulses are designed to be more rapid for motor neurons.

Consider the speed at which a thought can travel across the world and
how has it changed over time. After all, our individual thoughts lead
to words and actions, which ripple through social networks both
natural and virtual. Throughout history, this velocity of information
has steadily increased until it exploded in the 19th century with the
telegraph. (The development of telecom shed the physical constraints
and (multiplied) the virtual channels available for communication.)

Wherever there is supply and demand, you'll find economic dynamics and
information is no exception. While no one in Germany counted all the
Bibles in 1350, the (notion) that documents are tangible and countable
changes how people react to perceived supply and demand. Unwritten
records are much harder to pin down, but what's the use in bartering
for a juicy piece of gossip if you don't get it early on? Information
(conveys) power when it is scarce, even when it may not be true. When
a rumor is held tightly, it is easier to trace. While we never poll
our friends to tally up an information histogram, our mind is always
making inferences because the distribution of information usually
tells us more than the info itself. Small talk may be all about the
weather and the Yankees, but it can tell us about who talks to who and
more.

Macroscopically, technology's effect on information diffusion produced
viral sociocultural transformation, often with political or economic
consequences. Writing was developed once and never forgotten.
Religious systems petrified on exposure to clay tablets, gradually
locking these ephemeral systems of thought in place. The printing
press democratized writing, effectively seizing it from the priest
class by undermining the economics that enabled tight control.

Each major innovation opened a new movement in our impressionistic
arrangement of cross-cultural collaboration. Each led to its own
gradual crescendo as it reverberated across the world, inspiring a
chorus where each new voice was increasingly pronounced, distinct and
memorable. Each of these movements was a spontaneous contribution
forwards in information mechanics, dynamics and expression. This
progression offered many potential paths as it moved us towards an
increasingly singular zenith. Our (understanding) of the
(destination), the journey, and each macroscopic fragment can be
(completed) by dissecting the fundamentals of communication and
information.


#### The beginning of the end for the illusion of separation?

Without intelligent life, the universe might never manifest awareness
of itself. Humanity has reached a transitionary period where
communication networks allow our ideas to pollinate maximally. This (
moment) symbolically represents humanity's awareness of ourselves
(reaching a kind of fullness) as it ripens. Our understanding of
ourselves reaches a state of (totality or completeness) to a degree of
(personal) significance, the magnitude of which we may only ever
witness once.

The same confluence of phenomena to usher in this eudaimonic
actualization of being humanity lead to tectonic shifts in
sociophysical mechanics. While the set of rules for interaction
remains unchanged, the observed phenomena and dynamics (diverge).
When the Big Bang transitioned through inflation, the laws of physics
dominating interactions remained constant. The rules didn't change,
but unique dynamics emerged because the specifics of the system caused
various rules to be more significant, resulting in some behaviors that
were never seen again.

> quick note on scientific rigor of social physics...

So, there will be paradigm shifts in how sociophysical mechanics weave
together to influence interaction and how people think about it.
Population density and broadband access profoundly impact how these
shifts unfold. It's not clear which is (worse): shifts that seem
seismic or those we barely notice shifting beneath our feet.

We are seeing some of these effects now. For example, potential
election manipulation and -- holy shit -- did anyone log into social
media in 2016? Information amplification is rampant.  Manipulation of
information is as old as predator and prey, except that the fabric of
information and communication is shifting. It's like a space that's
bending and folding into itself. Most of us still see everything as
though we are within that space, but some of us know how to use it to.


#### The other side of the S-Curve

There are reasons that an S-Curve emerges where it does. It opens with
exponential growth and, like an unfortunate perfectionist, all it
knows is overachievement and blue skies. Then, suddenly, this curve's
distribution hit's a wall: it's a negative externality. Yet, since
it's never known life outside the petri dish, this curve decides to
wish upon agar. Unfortunately, the s-curve's fate is sealed and the
system is just as closed as the petri dish.

Systems can be open, closed or various combinations of both. Each has
its own idiosyncracies. A system that will end as closed often looks
just like an open system that might never be closed. If you aren't
aware of what caused the system to be closed, you would expect trends
to continue indefinitely.

Most systems can be viewed as open or closed. If you try to view the
selection of public stocks as open, then you start with a good index
and familiarize its stocks one by one, gradually learning to trade. If
you instead choose to view the selection of stocks as closed, then,
like Warren Buffet, you might grab a copy of Moody's and memorize the
avaiable stocks, one by one. When you model available the wider
financial markets as a closed system, then every trade effectively
results in an equal and opposite shift in value from one asset to
another. This is several conditions hold: that no money enters or
leaves the system, amoung others. Closed systems allow you to make
reasonable inferences about preservation aggregate quantity.

### Why does it matter?

The noosphere, our shared information ecosystem, combines the traits
of open in closed along various measures. It's both open and closed in
a very complicated way. The transition from open to closed leads to
divergent phenomenological implications. When we notice that
sociophysical mechanics (appear to change dramatically), it is often
because our shared system of social interaction is more or less
constrained by some factors, which are functionally coupled to various
measures of "system boundedness".

While communication networks are converging, what happens is that
people send and receive radically more information. In this respect,
system is bounded not by how fast data can be transmitted, but by how
much data people have have to transmit. In this simplication, the
system fluctuates: telecom expands, people buy new phones with new
apps, they send gifs, telecom removes bandwidth limits, then people
figure out they can send videos.



- Which number is higher? Seven billion? Or Infinity? Is seven billion
  even comparable?



![probably include a picture of an s-curve]

  - dominated interactions
  - (permuted) sociophysical mechanics

  - what could be exploited?
    - amplification of information may spiral out of control (or be
      controlled via AI and thus inaccessible)
    - information economics: scarce information becomes rare
    - major network outages result in intensely inverted circumstances
      - e.g. information economics are suddenly inverted for millions
        of people who may have otherwise never experienced pre
        21st-century life



- open systems vs closed systems
  - the mechanics and dynamics of information are fundamentally
    different in a closed system
  - the system becomes "closed" in various ways:
    - there is vastly more information produced than could ever be
      consumed by humans bc population growth and automated data
      generation
    - we reach a knowledge plateau (or singularity)
  - this affects information mechanics/dynamics how?
    - information economics becomes ~demand-side~
    - information converges differently at various scales
      - or in some cases becomes non-convergent
      - as one zooms out more, there is little apparent difference in
        the range/variety/distribution of information
      - anscombe paradox for the distribution of information at
        in various sections of a social graph
      - this isn't a problem, just a peculiarity. it's the opposite of
        the 15th century society where almost every single person
        who's ever read a book read the same one: the Bible
      - this seems subtle, but has profound implications, discussed in
        the second section


- Paradoxically, (that which) enables our understanding total
  self-awareness leads to paradigm shifts in the mechanics and
  dynamics of information that can very easily create
  instability. (rewrite)
  - the beauty that we will see is what we should have been able to
    see all along. of course, we should appreciate it, but if we let
    it distract us, we will find ourselves caught off guard.

  - the capacity for instability means that we have to work incredibly
    hard against (essentially game theory).
    - during this transitionary period, we will all have our own
      understanding of how the world has changed. there are
      opportunistic tactics that exploit the (novel) paradigms of
      information mechanics & dynamics, so almost everyone will be
      caught off guard in some way or another.


- we need to meditate on how those fundamentals of
  communication/information, in the context of convergence/etc and
  exponential change, lead to ... (drastically different conclusions
  on what our purpose is and what our challenges are)

  - blinded by our ego
  - information saturation & overstimulation
  - individuality/privacy is diminished
  - causality becomes incredibly difficult to understand

  - ironically, even though we are able to observe ourselves in near
    totality, connect to almost anyone globally, and solve all our
    problems, our greatest threat is nihilism and our greatest fear
    will be ourselves.



### 

- sociophysical communication physically limits information flux
  - in ancient times, information flux was mostly limited to physical
    contact.
  - as time progressed, population growth itself lead to more
    information and more information flux. technology advances further
    augmented this trend for ever increasing information flux.
    - writing established information permanence.
    - navigation & ship-building increased the maximum range for
      information to spread, quickly
    - economics incentivized management of information to predict
      trade and resource trends.
  - ancient people could assume that as population increased, so did
    the likelihood of new technological innovations
    - they could also assume that the network effect ...
    - further, population density in itself also changes the way that
      information diffuses geographically.
      - (reynold's number)
      - similar to how the speed of sound changes in varying density,
        the average speed at which an idea or piece of information
        travels changes based on the density of population. the
        specifics of the information can also affect how quickly it
        will be propagated.
      - (reemphasize why the physics metaphors are so applicable for
        social physics.)


###

- Here, the narrow spectrum of available info fluctuated perpetually.
  - transition into brief reiteration on information economics before
    the printing press..


Prior to the press, all written records were copied manually.
Accumulation of writing was roughly bounded by the literate
population, a kind of abstract membrane whose size loosely correlated
to a population's permeability to written records. Copies more
numerous and accessible resulted in more frequently amplified
information. If the work wasn't financed by the church or state, the
information's time-to-live drastically plummeted, which parallel's the
IP Protocol's TTL value. If there were no written records, reflections
of the information only persisted if they were retransmitted faster
than they decayed. If supply increased and demand stayed high, ...

.. it would be retransmitted

was only remembered if it was prioritized enough to establish
consensus among the people. (rw)
  - in the dark ages, information deemed undesirable was often
    punished by death.

After the printing press, both the copies of information and the
frequency by which records were published increased by orders of
magnitude. Information consensus, at that point, was effectively
physical. In order to suppress information, it required the location
and destruction of all physical instantiations of the information. To
purge records with certainty meant locating them without raising
alarm.

- The speed of information is just one quantifiable social metric
  whose (momentary scale) led to a profound effect on human history.
  - (succinctly describe other metrics at a high level, that were
    easily observable by people throughout history, whose trends could
    be anticipated)
  - distribution of information
  - spectrum of available information
  - value of information

- emphasize how virtual channels of communcation remove physical
  constraints...
  - cite the social physics paper on studying differences in
    physically/virtually connected social networks


- Other quantifiable metrics of human interaction exhibit similar
  trends
- There are other quantifiable metrics of human interaction that
  exhibit similarly (fascinating) dynamics.

Social physics models social behavior

- focus on analogies b/w physics and networking/social information
  - particularly on an analogy of the speed of sound and social
    xmission, as population density grows

### Single Most Important Conclusion from Learning Social Physics

- the single most important conclusion I can draw from a mathematical
  assessment of social physics is that the ability to make valid
  assumptions on information/beliefs and the behaviors of nodes is
  unparalleled
  - if you cannot do these things, you cannot expect to predict
    specific or general behavior and you cannot expect to extrapolate
- this leads into a discussion of schematic complexity

- a second critical factor is the lack of multitasking:
  - particles can only really do one thing & can only think one thing
    at a time, which bounds how quickly state changes can occur

# (Social Physics Overview)

Information has a life of its own and nowhere does this become more
clear than in social physics, which is a mathematical framework for
modeling idealized social behavior with physical constraints. (It's
mind blowing, but the bad news is) that almost every problem is
incomputable. Incredibly useful insights can be extrapolated from a
philosophic exploration of social physics.

Social physics was originally developed in the 19th century (links) to
explain how the behavior of players in simplified games were affected
by the imposition of physical (rules/constraints). It originally
borrowed heavily from classical mechanics and now overlaps with
quantum mechanics, since non-deterministic games are loaded with
probabilistic mechanics. Social physics can help us understand team
sports, advanced
[swarm behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour), the
geometric mechanics of battle tactics, cocktail parties and the finer
mysteries of feng shui. Each of those activities (determined by the
physics of the space) space and players in a social game with rules,
though with feng shui, the game and players may be less clearly
defined.

If you begin modeling games where players have their own sets of
information, social physics becomes irrevocably and hopelessly
incomputable, almost immediately. There are several layers to this,
where each adds complexity that extends the hardness of the problems.

#### &#x2605; Do the players contain their own copies of information or is it shared?

#### &#x2605; Do instances of information adhere to a defined schema shared among all players?

#### &#x2605; Can the information schema be modified?

#### &#x2605; Can the information be known in totality for the game?

#### &#x2605; Can a player access their own information in totality or reflect on its schematic structure?

#### &#x2605; Do players need to make inferences based on the information schemas of other players?

It isn't clear (which of the above) will add the most complexity, but
in social situations players almost always operate with incomplete
understanding. They can do so effectively because they've been
conditioned with proactive and reactive behaviors that (...).
Information overload can negatively affect players. The (questions)
pertaining to information schema and information reflection add an
incomprehensibly infinite degree of complexity. For the
mathemtaticians, yes, modifiable schemas with or without reflection
are definitely uncountable.

All of this means that players have to be good at handling
information, but better at balancing uncertainy and risk with
goal-seeking behavior. If the game being modeled is soccer or some
other team sport, there are subtle sociophysical aspects that can
vastly improve team performance, such as ensuring visibility and other
mechanics of communication. If the team works together and can share
its understanding of the state of the field, this can help immensely
with coordinating tactics.

There are other physical aspects of soccer which are also modeled by
social physics, such as the typical FIFA 2017 stats: speed, energy,
skill, etc. The best players in the world can play together, but
unless they can read each other and anticipate the coordination of
tactics with limited signaling, the games will be reduced to the more
physical stats and positioning.

Social physics is distinguished by providing a framework for systems
where players react to informational components as well as their
dynamics.

  - these mathematical frameworks/solutions almost always incomputable
    - and knowing this, how do you identify what can be modeled or
      known? and how do you structure your processes and behaviors to
      collect data to efficiently model information dynamics and
      social phenomena


# The Definition of Power

### Power Can Be Defined as the Potential to Trigger Flux through the Social Network

- this flux comes in many forms, including the induction of:
  - physical change
  - informational change
  - schematic change
  - behavioral change

- the forms above are higher-order. that is, what we see IRL are
  really combinations of the above:
  - informational change that results in physical change
  - informational change that results in eventual schematic change on
    a social scale
  - behavior change that results in long-term physical changes
  - physical changes that result in informational changes
  - schematic change that results in self-perpetuating changes over
    the course of years, decades or centuries (i.e. religion)

- this potential for flux/action is very much dependent on the beliefs
  of nodes in the system and a differential of information available
  to the nodes.
  - that is, if there is already complete disemination of some pieces
    of information to a set of nodes, you have reduced or lost the
    capacity to influence those nodes through the disemination of that
    information
    - this is overly simplified because, again, everything is a
      lower-order conjugation of the above higher-order forms
    - differential equations
  - but the social graph that emerges on top of physically interacting
    particles (idealized people) in a social system functions very
    much like an electrical network
    - in this way, power and information function similarly to
      voltage, amperage, gates, etc, albeit in an extremely-high
      dimensional way
    - math problems that are extremely high in dimension or infinitely
      dimensional function in radically different ways
      - this often studied as the curse of dimensionality and it's
        implications in various areas of math diverge widely

- the inability to scalably model or to even ascertain pieces of
  information, which are sometimes unindexable if no rigid schema can
  be devised, means that the way in which information is handled in
  these models becomes infinitely more important
  - i.e. convergence and homogeneity of belief systems is required to
    make *any* useful inferences and those aspects of the systems
    which cause schematic divergence become problematic


# (Physics Analogies for Social Systems)

- people as particles: temperature, density, state, etc.
- speed of sound
- phase changes
- configurational entropy & conformational entropy

### Tempurature

- should this be moved to an article on social physics?
- the ideas of "temperature" and "energy" for the high-dimensional
  systems of social physics
  - spatial or physical temperature/energy/motion
  - the more metaphysical, high-dimensional temperature/energy of
    information

- social physics temperature, induced by sunrise
  - informational movement from east to west
    - increasing "temperature"


### Speed of Information Transfer



### Particles and Molecules

- (note up front that everything in this paragraph is overly
  simplified. rename people as particles and describe it as a
  simulation)
- IRL social interactions are constrained by the spaces they occur in.
  - if viewed top-down in 2D, geometric patterns emerge.
  - this is where the physics interactions get interesting because, if
    you idealize them to a sociophysical model, people interact with
    shared fields, just like particles do.
    - there are fields that attract and repel. there are fields that
      are far more complicated than any in physics, like the shared
      field of attention.
    - when interacting, people try to harmonize the space between each
      other. they like to be close when they are interested in the
      interaction, but not too close.
      - so in an overly simplistic model, they influence a shared
        field that causes them to repel and attract each other.
    - but, people are constantly reading each other and there is this
      shared field of attention that emerges.
      - people have a natural urge to know what other people are
        interested in. so, they subconsciously read signals that
        indicate attention
        - imagine a 2D space with a heat map that shows everyone's
          average object of attention
        - they are naturally pulled towards the areas of the heatmap
          that are strongest.
        - they are pulled towards the gradient of the laplacian of the
          group's influence on the shared field of attention... (reword
          this)
        - IRL, it's not so simple.

- then you can define rules that determine which particles can
  transmit information
  - they have to be within some minimum distince to "connect"
  - once they are connected to a group, the simulation's interactions
    have a set rules
  - but particles should form groups that resemble molecules, but
    because of how the particles simultaneously repel and attract each
    other, they form a fairly limited set of molecule shapes.
    - the shapes are primarily circular (2-6 people can easily circle
      together and talk in a fairly noisy space)
    - but then, depending on how each particle's attention affects
      their behavior and physical orientation, these primary shapes
      can merge to form more complex shapes.
  - these group connections have a logical graph structure that is
    imposed ontop of the physical structure (the shape of the
    "molecule")
    - IRL, people are moreso thinking about the logical structure when
      they interact, but the physical structure also matters.

- the geometry that emerges in IRL social interactions also adheres to the
  spatial constraints.
  - the physical arrangement of objects in the space contributes
    heavily to range of possibilities for interactions that emerge,
    but also strongly shapes the physical and logical geometry of
    group interactions.
    - feng shui helps us think about this aspect of social
      interactions
  - this sounds complicated, but isn't. if there's a restaurant with
    ten tables in one of its rooms, the people who sit down can only
    arrange themselves in specific ways.
    - this is similar to "holes" in N-doped and P-doped silicon
      transisters, if we're overly eager for physics analogies.
  - so, the physical arrangement of the space and functional specifics
    of its objects tends to constrain the configurational and
    conformational entropy of interactions in the space.

### Configurational Entropy in Sociophysical Systems

- need to review the concepts here:
  - conformation space are the probabilities of seeing particular
    conformations of molecules, which AFAIK is not concerned with the
    orientation of molecules (at least not the probability
    distribution of conformations)
  - configuration space has more to do with valid and realistic
    arrangements of molecule types throughout a system.
    -

prevalence of...?

- as a sociophysical system progresses, you can keep track of the
  amount of time specific "molecular" configurations of participants
  spent connected.
  - this forms a kind of combinatorially-derived entropy, but it's not
    thermodynamic entropy. it's closer to Shannon's informational
    entropy.
  - you can also keep track of the *types* of configurations that
    emerge. this is probably more important, considering there are
    factorially more combinations with more particles.
    - if there are multiple particle types, then each counts as a
      symbol for combination. (i.e. AA/AB/BA/BB for types A & B)
  - this is useful because you get feedback on understanding how the
    rules of your simulation affect the kinds of interactions that
    emerge amoung particles.
    - and it can help you identify when the rules of the system are
      weighted improperly, leading to lower configuration entropy and
      a skewed distribution

- this concept carries over to organic chemistry, where it's called
  configuration entropy. there is also conformational entropy, but
  this is a weaker analogy b/w organic chemistry reactions and social
  physics simulations.
  - you could say that a social physics simulation with arbitrary
    rules yields conformations of nodes, some more or less stable
  - but, the types of conformations for a group of molecules are less
    defined. it's probably not as useful without some means of
    restricting the types of conformations that emerge by placing
    constraints on particle interactions


#### "A Phase Change in the Functional Fabric of Reality"

- nature of duality vs agency, along geographic/philosophic dimensions
- an agent's degree of influence and perceived influence over
  environment, especially as it relates to some permanent state
  changes.
  - in particle systems which are high-dimensional and where the
    particles have agency and intentionality, phase changes among
    particles have a far greater capacity for effecting other
    particles in the system.

- for the common person to understand, they need to understand what a
  phase change in physics actually is and, most importantly, what a
  phase change is defined as outside of physical systems.
  - if you think of solid, liquid, gas, plasma, BEC ... what makes
    each one what it is?
    - they are composed of the same particles, mostly.
    - why is it that they "seem" so different, qualitatively?
    - how do you define what conditions lead some substance to begin
      to transform itself into a different phase?

- how do you model the interactions between a mixture of a single
  substance where different parts of the space you're observing are in
  different phases?
  - this is the most important part of understanding what a phase
    change is and carrying it over to non-physical systems: how does a
    physicist mathematically model different phases of a
    single-substance system and *why*?
  - this is what distinguishes systems with math that can model phases
    and those that can't.
    - phase changes introduce and enable dramatically different modes
      of interaction between the substance and both it's consitutuent
      parts and it's environment.
    - for example, solids propagate energy as more clearly defined
      waves moving across a more limited set of crystal configurations
      - liquids and gases also propagate waves of energy across the
        system, but there are more physical degrees of freedom for how
        a particle can kinetically react.
      - but, this qualitative change in how a particle reacts to its
        envrionment emerges not from signal particle or the state of
        its local environment, but from more macroscopic relationships
        that emerge from a *group* of particles.
        - that is, it's *difficult* to say whether a single atom of
          carbon is a particular phase at any temperature.
          - the carbon atom just acts like a carbon atom and nothing
            else.
        - as a aside: this is also why various configurations of
          matter at the nano scale can have such dramatically varied
          behaviors that do not appear on more macro scales and do not
          appear for singular atoms and molecules
        - some of these properties are chemical and electrical and,
          thus, are not traditionally considered "phases" by chemists
          or physicists.
          - physical phases are defined as being completely separate
            from the chemical properties of the atom or substance.
        - but the "phase" of a region of a substance determines how
          that section of matter interacts with matter of the same
          substance in other adjacent slices of space.
          - that is, even though it's very literally the same
            substance, the "rules" for how it physically interacts
            change.

- and so, there are phase changes in many kinds of systems. they are
  not just confined to physical systems. some chemical properties of
  matter can be dependent on the substance's phase.
  - some chemical properties that only emerge on the nanoscale could
    be modeled as "phases" although they are not related to the
    physical phases of solid, liquid or gas.
    - and so, as you zoom out to larger collections of the same
      substance, it loses those properties from the nanoscale
      configuration of matter, unless that fragile nanostructure is
      held consistent across the entire material.

- soooo ... what are phase changes in sociophysical systems?

### everything is a wave

  - information in social physics should be modelable as waves,
    communicated among players in social games, idealized as
    particles)
  - social phenomena can be modeled with social physics, but almost
    everything is incomputable.
  - however, similar to how there are many kinds of interactions
    between particles and waves, interactions in social physics can be
    understood with infinite dimensional waves
    - however, the structure of information infinite and unknowable

# Critical Metrics for Sociophysical Systems

- the speed at which any piece of information could travel

- the definition of information convergence across a network
  - that is, at what percentage of people in a network would you
    consider the piece of information common knowledge?
  - this is an important metric because its definition affects
    "velocity" of convergence or "distance remaining" to convergence
  - what are the specific ideas from math that define this in abstract
    terms?
    - this would concern metrics of convergence for graphs and is
      probably related to entropy

- the length of time it takes for an urgent piece of information to
  converge across a network.

- (better word than convergence?)

- the degree of repition or replication that's required for
  information to achieve permanence, with various levels of technology.
  - before writing, only highly-prioritized information would be
    achieve convergence through replication.
  - after the printing press, ...

- the quantity, qualities and dynamics of information flux networks.
  - do nodes exchange information at regular times? with what degree
    of certainty?
  - which nodes exchange information? how often? how much?
    - are any of these things predictable?
      - you'll find that, the more physically bound a social system
        is, the more confidant you can be in predicting/anticipating
        these things.

- shannon entropy (i.e. informational entropy) related to the
  more abstract structure of information
  - in other words, what kinds of information, messages and ideas are
    most people going to talk about
  - in a language or character set, this is easier to define.
  - in this context, the structures and variations you are measuring
    are infinite
  - this measure of entropy is important for understanding how to
    distract and disguise.

- measures of energy for information transfer/convergence
  - literal physical energy required to transfer information
  - dirichlet energy (?)
    - this is a generic measure of energy. what are some specific
      examples of applying this idea to sociophysical systems?

- measuring/analyzing the graphs/networks in sociophysical systems
  - (are there better terms for these ideas? it'd be better to find
    the right terms from math/physics)
  - interpersonal networks viewed as graphs
    - hierarchical structures: identifying subgraphs ... which are
      self-similar
    - identifying boundaries in the graphs
    - identifying geographic boundaries with a higher capacity to be
      "expander graphs" for the global system (reword this?)
      - this describes america/europe and other areas with diverse
        populations. these areas are more tightly connected with the
        rest of the world.
      - this well-connected aspect of america's social network can be
        leveraged as an asset. (soft power, economic development,
        etc.)
        - expander graph may not be the appropriate term, but
          describes a graph that is maximally connected from any node,
          while having a relatively minimal number of connections.
        - so, from any arbitrary node, you can find a minimal path to
          any other node in the graph. (viz. it's an efficiently
          structured graph. the complete graph is not a good expander
          graph because it's not efficiently connected)
        - AFAIK, the human brain functions as an expander graph with
          some other regular structure
  - analyzing the sociophysical dynamics of information diffusion
    - are some areas more porous?
      - more likely to retransmit information?
      - more likely to absorb new information?
    - how do differences in language affect the transmission of
      information?

- measuring the regularity of phenomena in the system

- measuring the different kinds of flux in a system

- vessels for containing information
  - (these aren't metrics, but there are important metrics related to
    them)
  - vehicles for moving information
    - foot, horse, car, signal fire
    - imagine your a shady villan from a disney movie and you need to
      stop a message from getting to your king.
      - you know it's a letter; you know the messenger left 5 minutes
        ago; there are X roads leading to X towns
      - you can order people to move as fast as they can to stop the
        messenger, but you need to know whether you can stop the
        message, otherwise you have to change your plans.
      - can you be sure the people you order can outrun a messenger,
        if you don't know who they are?
      - (change the specifics in this scenario?)
      - people have a set of options available to them to transfer
        information. the mechanics of each option is crucially
        important when trying to decide if the information can
        physically escape.
