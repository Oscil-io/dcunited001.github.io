# Matroids & Illegal Math

- what happens with an infinite number of paths? nodes?
  - with infinite nodes are there necessarily infinite paths?
    - how do the aleph numbers vary along the matroids paths?
  - and when some sections are infinite and some are not?
    - it seems that you could easily break the matroid into
      equivalent subunits. and at least fully resolve some of
      the structure
    - the counts have to add up when you remove a node and it's
      paths
- resolving transitions between nodes on a path in an infinite
  matroid. you can approximate by tapering the effect subsequent
  transformations in the path.

- can graph nodes be composed together with an
  infinite number of null sets?
- combine matroids components with the null set in various ways
- can infinite matroids be reduced to finite matroids?
  - "sparse" matroids? crossed with lattice?

### FFT & Noise

how much can a signal be scattered before it loses its particular
aesthetic qualities?
- if an electric signal for music is propagating through a gnarly
  headphone cable that causes some dA/dt signal changes to scatter
  differently, how much can it scatter before the changes are
  noticable?
  - where A(t) is amplitude at time t
  - where the noise introduced N(t) is some change in amplitude across
    time and the N(t) noise function can be specified to adhere to
    some filtered frequency.
    - either low-pass, mid-range or high-pass
    - or some combination of those
- can the changes to the signal or the corresponding spectrum be
  predicted in some way? and are there ties back into group theory and
  abstract algebra here?
  - basically the changes introduced to an FFT spectrum by noise
    should correlate in some impossibly predictable way.
    - but what if it weren't impossibly predictable and were instead
      resolvable to number theory?
    - it would have to correlate to number theory in some way. i don't
      know how but it has to. I can see it.
