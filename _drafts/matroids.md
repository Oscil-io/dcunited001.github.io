### Matroids

- what happens with an infinite number of paths? nodes?
  - with infinite nodes are there necessarily infinite paths?
    - how do the aleph numbers vary along the matroids paths?
  - and when some sections are infinite and some are not?
    - it seems that you could easily break the matroid into
      equivalent subunits. and at least fully resolve some of
      the structure
    - the counts have to add up when you remove a node and it's
      paths
- resolving transitions between nodes on a path in an infinite
  matroid. you can approximate by tapering the effect subsequent
  transformations in the path.

- can graph nodes be composed together with an
  infinite number of null sets?
- combine matroids components with the null set in various ways
- can infinite matroids be reduced to finite matroids?
  - "sparse" matroids? crossed with lattice?

### Dimensionality

- enumeration of simple machines in more than 3 dimensions
  - i.e. what kinds of simple machines exist in 4D/5D/etc?
    - there should be more means of transferring/transmuting energy
      that arise in more complicated spaces
  - do special & general relativity permit additional types of
    machines that doen't normally exist in 3D?

### Theoretical Computer Science

- num of edges maximum, forcing networking maximums for computers
  - Probably related to
    [Ramsey Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory)

- probabilistic computing and probabilistic turing machines
  effectively describe the dynamical state machine programming idea
  described in my article
  - this form of programming might be most useful for programming
    quantum computers

#### TCS x Neurology

- piece together more accurate models of neurological functions based
  on estimated required computing power for each function and
  computation for networking each module together
- perhaps combine MRI's (SCION, SPECT & fMRI) from millions of people
  to generalize human problem solving processes
- and to create a human-derived superintelligence that emerges from
  the combination of information derived from this MRI technique
  - i.e. would it be possible to generate AI with fairly advanced
    cognition by deriving information from the structure of neurons &
    neural networks

### Prime Numbers

- there are increasingly complicated series of functions for
  predicting series of primes. Terrance Tao has done work on
  discovering relationships between these functions.
  - is there some graph that can relate these functions with a graph
    representing prime numbers?
  - if so, one can anticipate efficient search candidates to identify
    the prime numbers that aren't covered by these functions

### Graph Theory

- what is a mathematic way of describing the most efficient means of
  adding to a graph that has a shared global spatial component
  - e.g. adding water treatment plants to a graph of connected plants
    when one must minimize various costs: initial cost of
    infrastructure, energy/financial cost in function/upgrades
    - the most efficient solution here needs to account for total cost
      in system function
  - there should be some solution for evaluating new nodes added to
    the graph that involves partial overlays of subgraphs on top of
    the graph

### Social Mechanics

- mathematically accounting for the psychosocial dynamic of "opposites
  attract" for basic/sophisticated personality types
  - if connections and interactions b/w people are facilitated
    alleviating the gradient of disparity of knowledge/information,
    then what does this say generally about people who are basic and
    people who are well-educated
    - what are the psychosocial dynamics that emerge between
      combinated pairings/groupings of people
      - how do these dynamics change when people have various ranges
        of aggregate knowledge levels or various ranges of knowledge
        levels in specific fields
  - this becomes more complicated when considering the same problem
    for various types of knowledge (i.e. level of sophistication in
    various fields)
  - but, generally, people who have a higher disparity in
    knowledge/information from different fields will have more to talk
    about or more value to offer each other in terms of the knowledge
    they have to share.
  - "if you're the smartest person in the room, find another room."
- typologies of variation in psycho/socio/cultural dimensions,
  quantified with social media data.
- exploiting social media filter bubbles to create false consensus
  effect in targets, which can contribute to gaslighting campaigns

### FFT & Noise

how much can a signal be scattered before it loses its particular
aesthetic qualities?
- if an electric signal for music is propagating through a gnarly
  headphone cable that causes some dA/dt signal changes to scatter
  differently, how much can it scatter before the changes are
  noticable?
  - where A(t) is amplitude at time t
  - where the noise introduced N(t) is some change in amplitude across
    time and the N(t) noise function can be specified to adhere to
    some filtered frequency.
    - either low-pass, mid-range or high-pass
    - or some combination of those
- can the changes to the signal or the corresponding spectrum be
  predicted in some way? and are there ties back into group theory and
  abstract algebra here?
  - basically the changes introduced to an FFT spectrum by noise
    should correlate in some impossibly predictable way.
    - but what if it weren't impossibly predictable and were instead
      resolvable to number theory?
    - it would have to correlate to number theory in some way. i don't
      know how but it has to. I can see it.
- ... who's brain damaged now? T'ANKS OBAMA

### Hidden Subgroups

Is there some hidden subgroup at the root of number theory which is
mappable to all useful hidden subgroups? ... meh...
- what functions map these hidden subgroups together?

for edit distance, a hidden subgroup can be presolved for some
restatement of the edit distence problem. it's more useful when we are
operating edit distance on a small alphabet
- can a similar edit distance be resolved for floating point numbers
  for the laplacian function?
  - if so, i described how this would be done several months ago in
    some notes.
  - can this process for creating a map be applied to laplacian for
    real or rational numbers? or does it always need to be digitized
    or discretized to some finitely bounded range of values.
    - if not, can't some hidden subgroup map for reals be approximated
      from resolving the hidden subgroups for a large enough set of
      discretized Zn domains, where Zn is a set of integers (0..n-1)

### Systems of number representation involving phi & continuous fractions

i believe there may be systems of number representation which
circumvent the problems encountered by discretized representation such
as integers and rational numbers.
- the number system i'm imagining is based on continuous fractions or
  continuous operation.
- such systems are fluid and there are fixpoints which can be rooted
  to integer values.
  - further, the values phi and 0 are the roots of such a number
    system, but ALL OTHER REAL NUMBER VALUES CAN BE SPECIFIED
    - and i think even those values which no aleph can provide a basis
      - (Aleph0 to AlephInfinite, etc...)
  - however, such a number system would require an alternate system of
    maths and some operations would be very difficult and restrictive.
- i've outlined a lot of notes describing these ideas, but i've been
  afraid to post them.
  - however, half the time i think people are just messing with me and
    don't ever want me to accomplish anything. so when they try to get
    me to stop writing? i'm pretty sure they're just messing with me
    and seek to prevent me from posting rather rudimentary maths or
    ideas which are not dangerous, but would provide me with some
    credibility. HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

### Application of Category Theory to Planning/Producing Reality TV

- imagine a reality TV show that's a cross b/w *Punked* and *Choose
  Your Own Adventure*
- produce TV shows w/ enough alternate bridged content pathways
  coupled with enough abstracted deconstructed-but-reconstitutable
  content snippets
  - basically the show can be produced to "punk" someone because
    his/her reactions determine the content pathway choices through
    scenes that are braided together via Category Theory
  - e.g. there's always enough filler space (< 5 mins per episode) so
    that the rest of the content can be coherently braided together
    - this filler space in each episode can be filmed pretty late in
      the production process, or even produced by artificial
      intelligence
- producing the destructured alternate content encourages the actors
  to strengthen character development
- Some EEG technology could be used to gauge the Punked viewer's
  emotional response to the produced content to swap out content weeks
  before or in real-time
  - this is basically a sci-fi scenario where artificial intelligence
    create custom-tailored content and tweaks the content in real-time
    as it's delivered to the viewer based on their emotional reaction
  - but the reality TV show aspect of it is that the TV show is
    inverted: while the target watches TV shows tailored to his tastes
    and reactions, the rest of the nation watches his reactions
    unbenknownst to him/her

### Category Theory & Real-Time Video Stream Mutation

- in the era of netflix & VR, most people consume video content alone
  - this is a bit antisocial, but it also means that streamed video
    content can be subtly altered to some degree without an individual
    knowing it
    - this is because there is no guarenteed final form (VHS/DVD) of
      streamed video content
  - in particular, audio is more susceptible to mutation than video:
    it's easier to mutate without arousing the suspicion of the viewer
    - but there are also means of updating both video & audio in real
      time, provided that the AV mutations consume the same amount of
      time.
  - this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ladqJQLR2bA)
    describes a
    [study by University of Washington](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~supasorn/0550.pdf)
    that does exactly that, although it requires quite a bit of
    preprocessing
    - the point is, with some imagination and a massive supercomputer,
      it is theoretically to update video and especially audio streams
      of targeted viewers in real-time,
      - even though it's in no way technically feasible or practical,
        this *could* be used for gaslighting operations
    - there are a fairly limited number of personalities on TV, which
      makes enumerating each personality's gesture/voice profile a bit
      more tractible
      - the transformations b/w these personality profiles should be
        enumerable and precomputable via combination
  - furthermore, at least recent contracts with said personalities
    should negotiate for their likenesses, which should permit
    networks to compel the personalities to allow the use of their
    likeness in this manner
    - for flexibility with pretty standard VR/AR features, contract
      negotiations for content should include the ability to use
      modified versions of the likeness of personalities
- however, getting this to work both in-real-time and with zero
  noticeable flaws would be impossible
  - further, the amount of computing power required means targets
    would be limited

# GPU Ideas

- GPU algorithm to utilize lighting/spectra/raytracing in a
  hyperdimensional way to enable enhanced indexing and isomorphic
  functional composition
  - (1) broadcast primative or conjugate id's of functional composition to
    an initial surface/texture
    - these are broadcast in a statisical way through some spatial
      system (in a system with physical lighting, this is a linear 3D
      spatial system, but the space does not need to be cartesian)
  - (2) spectral and statistical sampling methods used to recompose fn
    calls

- factoring masks for stencil operations
  - only write to the pixel if it is evenly divisible by some
    prime/coprime

# AI Ideas

- AI algorithm that searches Hubble/etc for pictures of galaxies, etc
  that resemble artifical objects

- an AI based on distributed software-defined-networking (this will
  probably take over the world)

- train watson to trade commodities and forex based on real-time
  streams of geolocated facts about industries/areas affected by events
  - cross with are of publication exposure
  - obviously someone already has this running

# Continued Fractions, Irrationality and Pi

- continued fractions can be used to index ANY real number, even
  irrational numbers.

### Continuous Fractions as a Basis for Number/Coordinate System

- phi is the prototypical continued fraction and the identity
  operation mapped to the identity value on some kind of group related
  to continuous fractions.

- are there means of measuring the aleph degree of continued fractions?
  - coordinate planes and spaces for continuous fractions?
    - connections to the hyperbolic plane?
  - phi should be the origin of such spaces of graphing continuous
    fractions ... or should it be, if it's the identity?

- what is `X = 0 + (0 + 1/(0 + (1/...)))`
  - this or some simliar definition may have a connection to infinity

- continued fractions are basically glorified long division with a
  baseless number system
  - this is why phi is the *most irrational* number, which has been
    studied, because it's definition has the most parity

- from a continued fraction definition where the numerators are
  indexed by n and valued as (X1 ... Xn), examine such a definition of
  phi: can any equivalent values be determined by fixpoint most values
  of Xn and combinating values of the rest?
  - i.e. can you have some continued fraction that definitively
    equates to another, similarly structured continued fraction?
  - this is similar to what i ask below when discussing lie algebra
    for continued fractions

### Continued Fractions and Group Theory

- several important properties hold for phi and continued fractions
  - there are group theory connections here
  - e.g. the definition of phi holds for division or roots
- these can be described as groups
  - {phi, cont(+,sqrt)}
  - {phi, cont(+,*)}
  - ... the notation is horribly incorrect
  - and these are necessarily groups with infinite domains
- what arithmetic rules are allowed when using continued roots or
  continued fractions?
  - what rules allow you to rearrange a formula?
  - and why? this is where understanding a kind of group theory
    interpretation of the structure of continued statements is
    important.

#### phi defined from continued division

```
phi = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(...)))
```

### phi defined from continued roots

```
phi = 1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + (...)^(1/n))^(1/n))^(1/n))
```

- for the above definition, are there imaginary & quaternary solutions
  or aspects to this definition?
  - or does this mean they don't hold the same properties? (...??)
- how do complex numbers tie into a study of groups modeled with
  continuous fractions

### Lie Algebra for Continued Fractions

- lie algebra on the continued fraction structure for phi.
  - can you anticipate the effect that small transformations of values
    at indices (i, j, ...) have on the actual values encoded by the
    value of the continued fraction.
  - phi is the protypical example. all the numerators are
    one. therefore, when changing one or two of those values, certain
    value shifts with predictable structure should emerge.
    - the "kind" of structure in value shifts here is similar to those
      algebraic manipulations b/w groups studied by lie algebra.
    - if there is preservation of structure, then even if the
      structure itself is ineffable, there should be many
      opportunities for study here.
      - is there preservation of structure when mutating numerators at
        multiple indices when those indices are selected to satisfy
        specific properties?
        - e.g. if distance(i,j) == d, how does the structure/behavior
          change as i & j increase when the distance is constant?


### Pi as Continued Fractions

- pi as continued fractions:
  - patterns of primes in numerators/denominators?
    - used for narrowing a search on pi or predicting primes or
      spacing the domains/parameters used to discover new primes
    - and if the patterns of primes in these functions can be used to
      narrow search for pi, then each can be used cyclicly to discover
      the other. i.e. pi helps identify candidate large primes and
      large primes help narrow the real, continued fraction region of
      pi, which must be resolved to contain new, unknown primes.
  - the challenge of course is how to do that, exactly. how do you
    capture the structures of all these definitions and then use
    them mathematically to compare against each other.
    - then how do you design the software to use this information?

- there are many ways of writing pi as continued fractions, as noted
  on the
  [Wolfram page](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PiContinuedFraction.html)

- surreal numbers X continued fractions
  - is there a useful connection to surreal numbers when trying to
    create a system of mapping all real numbers with continued
    fractions?

- isnt a rational number a special case of the real numbers that
  should satisfy some conditions when indexed to be written as a
  continued fraction?
  - i.e. if rational numbers can all be written as m/n, then what does
    that mean for the structure/values of their continued fractional
    form?
  - is there some measure of irrationality? are there some numbers
    that are more irrational than others?


### Comparison of Pi as Infinite Series

- [Liebniz Formula for Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80)
  - this definition of pi alternates, as does `e`. however, not every
    numeric definition of pi alternates before converging.
  - this formula, an infinite sum, can be converted to an infinite
    product, called a Euler product
    - tangent: analog of euler product & dirichlet series for continued fractions?

![Comparison of Pi as Infinite Series](/img/posts/matroids/comparison-of-pi-infinite-series.png)

- this picture from wikipedia visually compares several iterative methods for approximating pi
  - [Viete's Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%C3%A8te%27s_formula)
    for 2/pi uses an infinite product of continued radicals
  - [Wallace Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product)
    uses an infinite product to generate pi/2

- with a glance at the article for
  [Van Wijngaarden transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Wijngaarden_transformation),
  the method i am thinking about for pi seems very similar.

### Analytical Analysis of Digits in Transendental Numbers derived by various methods

- attempt to resolve the "final" value of pi or any transcendental
  number that converges into a simple limit by using the formula for
  the transcendental number approximated in many different number
  systems.

- so, to calculate a better resolution of e, you do your calculations
  in each of base-2, base-3, base-5, base-7, etc.
  - only base-p numbering systems are used, where p is prime.
  - you end up with a value for e in base-2, base-3, base-5, etc
  - from here, you can run analytical methods to identify patterns in
    the various encodings of the transcendental numbers
    - you're looking for patterns in the digits of e or pi in
      different numbering systems.
