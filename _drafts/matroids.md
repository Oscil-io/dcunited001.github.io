# Matroids & Illegal Math

- what happens with an infinite number of paths? nodes?
  - with infinite nodes are there necessarily infinite paths?
    - how do the aleph numbers vary along the matroids paths?
  - and when some sections are infinite and some are not?
    - it seems that you could easily break the matroid into
      equivalent subunits. and at least fully resolve some of
      the structure
    - the counts have to add up when you remove a node and it's
      paths
- resolving transitions between nodes on a path in an infinite
  matroid. you can approximate by tapering the effect subsequent
  transformations in the path.

- can graph nodes be composed together with an
  infinite number of null sets?
- combine matroids components with the null set in various ways
- can infinite matroids be reduced to finite matroids?
  - "sparse" matroids? crossed with lattice?

### FFT & Noise

how much can a signal be scattered before it loses its particular
aesthetic qualities?
- if an electric signal for music is propagating through a gnarly
  headphone cable that causes some dA/dt signal changes to scatter
  differently, how much can it scatter before the changes are
  noticable?
  - where A(t) is amplitude at time t
  - where the noise introduced N(t) is some change in amplitude across
    time and the N(t) noise function can be specified to adhere to
    some filtered frequency.
    - either low-pass, mid-range or high-pass
    - or some combination of those
- can the changes to the signal or the corresponding spectrum be
  predicted in some way? and are there ties back into group theory and
  abstract algebra here?
  - basically the changes introduced to an FFT spectrum by noise
    should correlate in some impossibly predictable way.
    - but what if it weren't impossibly predictable and were instead
      resolvable to number theory?
    - it would have to correlate to number theory in some way. i don't
      know how but it has to. I can see it.

### Hidden Subgroups

Is there some hidden subgroup at the root of number theory which is
mappable to all useful hidden subgroups? ... meh...
- what functions map these hidden subgroups together?

for edit distance, a hidden subgroup can be presolved for some
restatement of the edit distence problem. it's more useful when we are
operating edit distance on a small alphabet
- can a similar edit distance be resolved for floating point numbers
  for the laplacian function?
  - if so, i described how this would be done several months ago in
    some notes.
  - can this process for creating a map be applied to laplacian for
    real or rational numbers? or does it always need to be digitized
    or discretized to some finitely bounded range of values.
    - if not, can't some hidden subgroup map for reals be approximated
      from resolving the hidden subgroups for a large enough set of
      discretized Zn domains, where Zn is a set of integers (0..n-1)

### Systems of number representation involving phi & continuous fractions

i believe there may be systems of number representation which
circumvent the problems encountered by discretized representation such
as integers and rational numbers.
- the number system i'm imagining is based on continuous fractions or
  continuous operation.
- such systems are fluid and there are fixpoints which can be rooted
  to integer values.
  - further, the values phi and 0 are the roots of such a number
    system, but ALL OTHER REAL NUMBER VALUES CAN BE SPECIFIED
    - and i think even those values which no aleph can provide a basis
      - (Aleph0 to AlephInfinite, etc...)
  - however, such a number system would require an alternate system of
    maths and some operations would be very difficult and restrictive.
- i've outlined a lot of notes describing these ideas, but i've been
  afraid to post them.
  - however, half the time i think people are just messing with me and
    don't ever want me to accomplish anything. so when they try to get
    me to stop writing? i'm pretty sure they're just messing with me
    and seek to prevent me from posting rather rudimentary maths or
    ideas which are not dangerous, but would provide me with some
    credibility. HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

# WHAT NUCLEAR MATHS?!

until someone tells me to stop writing and tells me why and accounts
for the psychological torture i went through, i'm absolutely not going
to stop writing. i feel like people are just screwing with me to
prevent me from ever answering these questions for myself.

How the fuck am i supposed to know? I've been barred from having any
kind of communication with people who undrestand math and computer
science.

AND HOW THE FUCK IS THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU? Let me out of my goddamn
cage you sick fucks. And stop trying to induce mTBI by blasting me.
