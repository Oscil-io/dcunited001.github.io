There is a novel paradigm for programming, for which the name is
elusive. It seems like a subject of research in theoretical computer
science. It describes systems of genetic programs built on the
foundations of molecular dynamics. It also helps describe systems in
social physics.

Particle systems are known to be dynamical and to display ergodicity,
under some situations. These systems can also be non-linear and thus
are chaotic, implying that minor changes in starting conditions can
result in unpredictable fluctations in system behavior.

###

Genetic systems have spatially distributed state, where the state can
be modeled as the binary presence or absence of some molecule in a
given range of space for every point. Additional information is
relavant to the system's mechanics, such as the molecule's physical
orientation relative to adjacent molecules. Thus, these are also
relevant to the spatially distributed state. This state is similar to
a program's closure -- the variables accessible to its total
environment or scope.

The arrangement of specific types of molecules in a cell's nucleus
determines the likelihood of interactions between adjacent
particles. Each one of these molecular interactions unfolds in a
unique way, but maps to a set of event types. One such event would be
the activation of an enzyme's active site. There's a limitless degree
of variation in how the event unfolds, but we recognize the result as
being logically the same. This is because the specifics of the
interaction map to idealized representations of the event type.

These interactions change the state of the local space in logically
significant ways, which dramatically alters the likelihood of
subsequent events. To reach for a programming metaphor, you can think
of this as a function that executes with side effects, modifying some
variable external to the function scope.

In genetic systems, general types of events include enzyme activation,
DNA transcription, epigenetic modifications, chromatin
transformations, miRNA/piRNA RNA amplification, and many others. When
RNA polymerase transcribes DNA, producing a strand of mRNA, this
increases the likelihood this mRNA will be translated. The more copies
of this mRNA the likely they are to result in result in protein
products, whether the copies originate from transcription or
amplification.

Molecular dynamics is computationally prohibitive. Even determining
the structure of some proteins from amino acid sequences can be
challenging because of this and other reasons. If we simplify the
system, we can reason about it more intuitively. For example, one
could simplify the spatially distributed state to binary
presence/absence of products that interact with nearby products.

states/metastates

By using models of varying complexity, we can design and develop these
genetic programs that operate in sufficiently similar ways, despite
the lack of deterministic behavior. What kind of programming paradigm
is this? (This question leads us to )

Humanity has been trying to understand the origins of life for
millenia and we're getting very close. Why do these patterns of
behavior emerge in the chaotic system of molecular dynamics? Why do
logically similar representations of particle configurations --
i.e. molecules -- emerge in similar proportions, despite dramatic
variations in their positions in the system. The system isn't defined
by the specific molecular arrangements alone because this can vary
widely and life can handle it.

As genetic programs execute, this leads to predictable changes in the
distribution and entropy for both molecular configuration and
conformation in the system. These distributions over time would more
closely distinguish one genetic program from another. Identifying
patterns over time get us closer.

These are chaotic systems. Their behavior is definitively
unpredictable and sometimes divergent...

- why does order emerge from chaos?
  - under what circumstances does order emerge from chaos?
  - do these circumstances always lead to stratification and
    self-similarity?

- what is meant by information representations in systems of molecular
  dynamics?
  - examples include quark configurations of the standard model or
    molecules, the representations of which can be combinatorially
    enumerated.
  - however, in reality, each molecule is different in subtle
    ways. The atoms will engage in characteristic modes of vibration,
    especially after bondind covalently, but these patterns of
    vibration are imprinted with residual information related to the
    specifics of the atomic interactions that created the
    molecule. Quantum mechanics further complicates everything.
  - yet, even though each glucose molecule might have idiosyncratic
    patterns of vibration, subtly influencing its transitions between
    conformations, we still consider the six-carbon ring a glucose
    molecule.

- glucose is made of six carbons and twelve hydrogens. every glucose
  molecule is distinct, but for any collection of these 18 atoms that
  are close enough, we can measure their similarity or distance from
  an idealized glucose conformation.
  - this group's quality of glucose-ness is emergent, but still maps
    to branching, metaphysical forms which can be combinatorially
    enumerated and whose definition is constant throughout time and
    space.
  - forms become increasingly diverse, as do the emergent dynamics
    whose action depends moreso on the symbolic identity of the
    representation than the constituent parts of the representation.

- are the definitions of molecules defined outside the chaotic system?
  no, not necessarily...
  - Imagine a simulated system with mechanics similar to molecular
    dynamics. In such systems, increasingly complicated forms emerge,
    some of which could be externally defined, yet this is not
    necessary.
    - a handwritten digit recognition network does not know anything
      about digits or handwriting.
    - likewise, the simulated chaotic system above can have mechanics
      based on emergent forms, which may or may not be defined
      externally.
    - internal or external, the dynamics of the system are dependent
      on the emergence and interaction of these forms, which become
      stratified in more layers.

  - at higher levels of order, from molecules to genetics to
    multicellular organisms, the structure of matter has a greater
    range of influence on the system and( is, at the very same time,
    much harder) to define. the definition of kinds of order requires
    more data and more tools. the mechanics of the system, especially
    in animals or entities with awareness, become decoupled from the
    mechanics that define the constituent parts.

- tie chaotic systems to programming concepts a bit more
  closely. define ~chaotic programming~
  - also contrast it with chaos computing

(needs to be reworded)

- chaotic systems whose behavior is parameterized by representations
  of information internal to the system always have the capability to
  produce increasingly higher levels of order within them.
  - does this mean that (representation-reflecting) chaotic systems
    with a degree of stabillity always produce behavior increasingly
    dependent on the representations themselves?
  - does this mean that some chaotic systems will produce order, then
    stability, then hierarchical stratification of internal state
    representations and finally life or awareness?
  - it sounds crazy, but can we model simple mathematic chaotic
    systems where order emerges over time, yielding this
    stratification and the dynamics based purely on representations of
    internal state?

- that is, can chaos itself become alive? can it become aware?
  - why did life emerge in the universe? are such chaotic systems
    required to be a certain size or will
