probably not going to publish this one. just going to collect a few
thoughts.


### China's Political System and Slowing Economic Growth means it must look outwards


- China's been doing greath with growth for decades and, up until 2015,
  was consistently hitting double digit numbers in terms of
  growth.
  - according to CATO's foreign policy report, which i haven't
    finished
    - I can't really say i fully agree with all the conclusions on
    policy... there's some good info in here though

- However, communism (and most governments when slowing after major
  economic booms) needs to feed its economy from external sources ...
  - and this has been slightly complicated by a slowdown in trade from
    American capital, ever since the recession.
  - but their desire to return to such high levels of growth will
    partially drive conflict in the region, which allows China to
    exert political influence over trade through the region
    - it also accomplishes a myriad of other major/minor goals for
      china. basically, there's a half-dozen reasons why they want
      this.


- paris climate deal on chinese, east asian and world economies
  - if more balanced economic growth can prevent conditions leading to
    tensions, then climate change could keep growth rates more coupled
    together and more
- paris deal takes effect 12/2016
