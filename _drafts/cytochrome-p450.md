about self-organizing entropy forming life


intro
- explain higher level organization of *-nomics
  - reference notes from Pavel Pevzner's lecture
- lead into metagenomics
- also explain it in relation to probabilistic programming
- make a value proposition to describe the value in theorizing about
  metanomics in this way
  - it's value is in evaluating/modeling technologies for
    predictive medicine
    - and assessing how to collect better information about what is
      activated
    - identifying epigenotypes in tissue that are precancerous
  - make this the intro article (about assessing state of Cytochrome
    P450 enzymes/proteins)
  - what diseases can be better modeled and how? why?
    - tracing the "epigenotypes" of cancer back through several
      pre-cancerous epigenomic states, which have an observable
      phenotype
    - then you can observe/detect that precancerous phenotype and deal
      with it more quickly/safely/effectively, etc
    - by scanning for aberrations in tissue type
- how should the methodologies of science be expanded to pick up on
  the data that would indicate the need for this theory?
  - expanding a genetic map to a map that includes methylation data
  - collecting the dna-methylation data
    - attaching tissue network address data to dna-methylation
      - and especially its variation
  - faster algorithms for genomic processing
    - more efficient data storage/collection

explain spatially distributed state at a high level
- hierarchically distributed state
- physical distribution of cells imparts some higher order
  hierarchical distribution of state (than just cellular)
  - e.g. groupings of cell types, blood brain barrier
- physical channels as mediation of state
  - veins/lymph system in an optimal state, will provide some optimal
    opportunity for exchange of state between tissues
  - ventricular system in the brain (need to look into details here)

part one: introduction:

- what is probabilistic programming
  - explain PP languages that are being explored
  - and why the research is being done (promising for machine learning
    & ai)
- explain what makes something a program
  - trees/loops
  - explain how it's hard for people to see how a set of probabilities
    - can lead to something with behaviors like a program
    - powersets of interactions, etc, etc
  - cells can even use metaprogramming
- list current models for biological behavior that this model
  -circumscribes
- what's the difference between current models and this paradigm for
  genetic behavior?
  - this model not only explains how genetics works in the nucleus,
    which directs operations of the cell
    - but also explains cytoplasmic interactions and
      cytoplasmic-nuclear interactions
      - that is, spatially distributed state extends beyond the
        nucleus
    - it also can help explain inter-cellular interactions
      - caused by chemical messengers (hormones & proteins)
      - or caused by more global change in state (pH, hydration)
      - or caused by more local change in state (changes across
        specific organs)
    - it can also explain inter-chromosome behaviors
  - current models seem limited to describing interactions between
    related genes
    - they don't describe how different chromosomes interact
    - they are overly simplistic in describing how protein products of
      genes interact
    - describing how controlling spaces within the cell and nucleus
      - are totally out of scope for current models
  - the probabilistic programming paradigm for genetic behavior is
    more complete
    - this makes it more complicated, but also simpler at the same
      time
    - basically, for each gene, protein, nucleoulus, transcriptome,
      cell, group of cells, organ, body, etc
      - there are a sets of functions that can be executed, each with
        a probability
        - executing the function changes the local state, which in the
          case of genetics is spatially distributed
    - looking at the complete picture while resolving the most minute
      details and interactions
      - is probably impossible, as you have to consider powersets of
        interactions and behaviors
    - but it should be possible to describe some behaviors and
      tendancies that could not be explained before


mapping out tissue networks in the body
- various kinds of "addressing" systems for communication between cell
  networks.

- cover introduction to ideas in general

- abstract idea of a maximum of addressable behaviors that is
  'conveniently-accessible' enough in some way, forming a maximum in
  programmable genetic behavior
  - because the space can't manage the information complexity without
    causing problems in it's dependable executablility
- giving way to a need for multi-karyotic cells
- lead into brief discussion on how this limit is another form of a
  mathematical limit imposed on computers as well
  - that is a maximum per-node limit for transformations or
    extensibility
  - imposing various computational maximum for behavior
    - spatial limits (a computer any bigger would create a black hole)
    - per-node mathematic limits
    - network bottleneck/overhead limits
  - this implies the existance of several hard limits for computation

part two: spatially distributed state
- explain what I mean by spatially distributed state
- transciptomes and nucleolus
  - use Process/Program & OS metaphors to describe these


(re)-explain spatially distributed state at a high level
- && hierarchically distributed state
- && physical distribution of cells imparts some higher order
  hierarchical distribution of state (than just cellular)
  - e.g. groupings of cell types, blood brain barrier
- && physical channels as mediation of state
  - && veins/lymph system in an optimal state, will provide some
    optimal opportunity for exchange of state between tissues
  - && ventricular system in the brain (need to look into details
    here)

part ??: metaprogramming
- some cells modify their own genomes to augment behaviors
  - genomic process for copy & pasted genes
    - is there a genomic mechnanism for preventing bad writes?
    - some writes would have almost no effect on genetic expression of
      critical factors
    - some writes would be disastrous for that generation or the
      subsequent generation
    - some writes would be disastrous for all subsequent generations
      of cells
- or modify the available mRNA & their rates of transcription into
  protein products
  - miRNA, piRNA?
    - these ramp up or inhibit the available mRNA's that are to be
      produced into protein products

establish the overall theme and tie each part back to how it
reinforces this theme
- genetics is a program where loops and trees of behavior can be
  predictably triggered
  - so go through examples from epigenetics and explain how they
    reinforce/demostrate/utilize this idea

how to structure this series of articles?

article about predictive medicine and CYP450
- this article might be a good start for probabilistic theory
  - but how to measure this?
  - explain why the expression of genetics has a much greater effect
    than the encoding of alleles in the genes, usually

- hmmmmm, there was like one other example of probabilistic
  programming theory of metanomics
  - neural fingerprints

metanomics and probabilistic programming
- mapping out tissue networks in the human body using MRI (diffusion
  tensor imaging) + Yoga.
  - need to be able to map various spaces together
  - the yoga postures cause different blood flow patterns
  - statistical resolution should allow us to map out tissues by
    looking at networks of small veins and arteries down to
    capillaries
- this should revolutionize cancer treatments because you can tailor
  someone's treatment plan to target specific networks of tissues
  - you can know that if you take out a set of tissue subnetworks,
    that you have taken out all of the branches leading to them
  - if the cancer is confined to that area, then you can know that
    there's a much smaller chance of it coming back
    - you have annihilated the tissue 'feeding' the cancer
    - so therefore, there should be a much lower chance of it
      returning
- this is like a "connectome" for probabilistic programming
  - the connectome is the highest level of tissue interconnection, but
    is stratified itself, as it's a tree
  - the brain has a connectome and this can be observed by using
    diffusion tensor imaging and some learning
  - but the yoga in the methodology inserts some known level of
    variance into the system of veins/arteries for specific areas of
    the body
  - those areas get more blood and open up
    - the MRI images can be sewn together and with enough imaging
    - then a highly accurate model of the connectome for the brain and
      other organs can be constructed

### Changes in Cytochrome 450 from long term drug usage

- long term usage of drugs which inhibit and especially those that
  induce metabolism by Cytochrome P450 enzymes should generally
  increase production of them.
  - e.g. consumption of alcohol should increase production of the
    enzymes that metabolize it through feedback loops that trigger its
    production.
  - one specific OTC allergy medication (only one AFAIK - Loratadine)
    induces the production of a enzyme that metabolizes several
    antipsychotics (haldol in particular, i think .. ?)
    - so, overuse of this drug could lead to temporarily and perhaps
      permanently increased production of that Cytochrome 450 enzyme.
    - this means that as your blood circulates through your liver,
      there will be more of these enzymes and they will process the
      substrates they act on much faster.
    - link into the study that demostrates this drug's effectiveness
  - therefore, long term usage of these inhibitors and inducers will
    change the expression of Cytochrome P450 genetic programs
    - inhibitors by providing a greater need for the drug to be
      metabolized faster (and therefore - sometimes - there should be
      a genetic feedback mechanism that encourages more of these
      enzymes to be produced)
    - inducers by directly affecting the mechanisms which interact
      with the cellular nucleus, causing it to create more of these
      enzymes
      - possibly using miRNA or piRNA, which can cause a runaway
        effect (they induce the expression of mRNA by creating protein
        complexes that copy segments of that mRNA's complement)
    - however, i don't really know the specifics of how Cytochrome P450
      production works. and each P450 system and enzyme
      would behave differently
  - but this would imply that a person's personal habits and diet
    would dramatically alter gene expression
    - particularly their usage of specific OTC & Rx drugs
    - this also means that genetic medicene will not be perfect,
      especially for psychiatry, unless the levels of these P450
      enzymes can be measured.
    - or their metabolism characteristics can be observed, then their
      presence could be inferred. yet this technique is susceptible to
      variation from diet (similar to how a cholesterol test would be)
      ... i think
  - so, for some prescription medicines, genetics can offer customized
    treatment with highly predictable outcome types.  but for others,
    the individual may not adhere to their apparent outcome type,
    primarily because of long-term diet and drug history, as well as
    excercise and activity habits.
    - obviously there are much fewer variables to control in animal
      experiments, so we should be wary of highly promising studies on
      predictive medicene where animal subjects were employed.
  - people don't seem to get it: your genes do not control your fate
    nearly as completely as we are lead to believe.
    - your actions and lifestyle can affect how your body functions
      - identical twins raised apart could look very similar, but be
        different heights or have different eye color.
      - if one twin is prescribed specific antipsychotics, that twin
        could be significantly overweight
      - or in this case, prescription drugs could have completely
        different effects on them, based on long term drug, diet and
        personal activity habits.
  - the paradigm that genetics determines your health leads
    people to lose hope over their life.
    - it tricks us into disempowering ourselves because we assume that
      our fate has already been decided.
      - "i'm fat because of my genes"
        - well yes, people are predisposed to different types of
          metabolism patterns and we process food differently
        - but there's not a gene that makes someone fat.
        - yet clearly, some things are harder for people than others
          - knowing how these things are interrelated helps, but i
            think the studies here could be misinterpreted.
      - and far more important than which specific genes you have is
        how they are activated.
        - you can change how genes are expressed through diet, drugs
          and personal activity
        - but we still don't know a lot about how to intentionally
          change genetic expression
      - yet, the message is clear: the habits you form in life and the
        actions you take matter.  the fate of your health is not
        predetermined.
