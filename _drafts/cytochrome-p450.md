### Changes in Cytochrome 450 from long term drug usage

- long term usage of drugs which inhibit and especially those that
  induce metabolism by Cytochrome P450 enzymes should generally increase
  production of them.
  - e.g. consumption of alcohol should increase production of the
    enzymes that metabolize it through feedback loops that trigger its
    production.
  - one specific OTC allergy medication (only one AFAIK - Loratadine)
    induces the production of a enzyme that metabolizes several
    antipsychotics (haldol in particular, i think .. ?)
    - so, overuse of this drug could lead to temporarily and perhaps
      permanently increased production of that Cytochrome 450 enzyme.
    - this means that as your blood circulates through your liver,
      there will be more of these enzymes and they will process the
      substrates they act on much faster.
  - therefore, long term usage of these inhibitors and inducers will
    change the expression of Cytochrome P450 genetic programs
    - inhibitors by providing a greater need for the drug to be
      metabolized faster (and therefore - sometimes - there should be
      a genetic feedback mechanism that encourages more of these
      enzymes to be produced)
    - inducers by directly affecting the mechanisms which interact
      with the cellular nucleus, causing it to create more of these
      enzymes
      - possibly using miRNA or piRNA, which can cause a runaway
        effect (they induce the expression of mRNA by creating protein
        complexes that copy segments of that mRNA's complement)
    - however, i don't really know the specifics of how Cytochrome P450
      production works. and each P450 system and enzyme
      would behave differently
  - but this would imply that a person's personal habits and diet
    would dramatically alter gene expression
    - particularly their usage of specific OTC & Rx drugs
    - this also means that genetic medicene will not be perfect,
      especially for psychiatry, unless the levels of these P450
      enzymes can be measured.
    - or their metabolism characteristics can be observed, then their
      presence could be inferred. yet this technique is susceptible to
      variation from diet (similar to how a cholesterol test would be)
      ... i think
  - so, for some prescription medicines, genetics can offer customized
    treatment with highly predictable outcome types.  but for others,
    the individual may not adhere to their apparent outcome type,
    primarily because of long-term diet and drug history, as well as
    excercise and activity habits.
    - obviously there are much fewer variables to control in animal
      experiments, so we should be wary of highly promising studies on
      predictive medicene where animal subjects were employed.
  - people don't seem to get it: your genes do not control your fate
    nearly as completely as we are lead to believe.
    - your actions and lifestyle can affect how your body functions
      - identical twins raised apart could look very similar, but be
        different heights or have different eye color.
      - if one twin is prescribed specific antipsychotics, that twin
        could be significantly overweight
      - or in this case, prescription drugs could have completely
        different effects on them, based on long term drug, diet and
        personal activity habits.
  - the paradigm that genetics determines your health leads
    people to lose hope over their life.
    - it tricks us into disempowering ourselves because we assume that
      our fate has already been decided.
      - "i'm fat because of my genes"
        - well yes, people are predisposed to different types of
          metabolism patterns and we process food differently
        - but there's not a gene that makes someone fat.
        - yet clearly, some things are harder for people than others
          - knowing how these things are interrelated helps, but i
            think the studies here could be misinterpreted.
      - and far more important than which specific genes you have is
        how they are activated.
        - you can change how genes are expressed through diet, drugs
          and personal activity
        - but we still don't know a lot about how to intentionally
          change genetic expression
      - yet, the message is clear: the habits you form in life and the
        actions you take matter.  the fate of your health is not
        predetermined.
