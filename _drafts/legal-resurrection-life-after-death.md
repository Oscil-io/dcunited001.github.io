### Law

- can you change the legal implications of contracts and laws by slowly
  altering the fundamentals of language?... i.e. in some meaningful
  way
- obviously, previous decisions involving some law establish precedent
  that isn't [so easily] circumvented by lingual shift

#### Probate Law

- death penalty loophole where the administration of death is not
  immediate, prolonging the process of death
  - this is an idea that i've had out of paranoia, purely from
    guessing and trying to understand what's happening in my own life
  - but one could administer death by being given a CRISPR virus that
    genetically triggers some neurodegenerative disease.
- this has very interesting legal consequences for "life" after
  "death"
  - is the person legally dead before dying?
  - how does this change the implementations of justice for crimes
    committed after death?
  - does a dead person have legal personhood? e.g.
    - can a dead person commit a crime?
    - can a dead person be a victim of other crimes?
    - does a dead person have constitutional rights?
    - does a dead person have basic human rights, like the right to
      opt out of research that is otherwise illegal?
      - do informed consent requirements still apply for research
        involving this person?
      - how does this relate to the FDA's
        "[Resuscitation](https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126431.htm)"
        exemption for informed consent?
      - in other words, could the death penalty be applied in a case
        where the person is given an option to be "resuscitated" in
        exchange for "life after death" under strict contractual
        obligations that this person is or is not made aware of?
        - i.e. they sold their soul
        - i.e. the person is now legally dead once and for all, but
          still living and breathing
      - this exemption may possibly be used to bundle a set of
        research studies into a single "research study" that permits
        human experimentation on such resuscitated individuals without
        their consent or knowledge
        - i haven't exactly found information that rules this out,
          even though i haven't found information confirming it
          - that is, information confirming it's legal possibility or
            instances of specific applications
          - if this is possible or has been tried, it would never be
            allowed to become public

- one aspect of secret courts that gives me pause is the
  administration of "justice" in secret
  - if justice is meted out in secret to someone who doesn't realized
    they are charged of a crime involving top-secret information
    - where the case plays out in secret or ex parte
    - can they ever know what they were charged of? how does this play
      out when one is proved guilty or innocent? does the guilty or
      innocent verdict change how this plays out? how does the appeals
      process play out?
    - what if the investigative means of ex parte are just carried out
      purely for documentation of false information without any
      indication to the accused?
      - the restrictions of desemination of top secret information
        make it easy to lie and easier to justify lying
      - i hesitate in referring to the accused as a defendant because
        in an ex parte case, there is no chance to represent oneself.
        - if somone doesn't have the right to forgo an attorney, then
          how does one fit the definition of a defendent?

- assume a hypothetical situation:
  - the accused is falsely convicted of a crime in secret court and
    has some arbitrary decidedly "fair" and "equivalent" justice meted
    out against them, their property or their livelihood in secret,
    - then what happens to them if they begin to discover what is
      happening to them?
      - does this make the punishment worse?
      - does their awareness of what's happening effectively prevent
        them from defending themselves or fighting back?
  - if a group of people talented enough in legal gymnastics involving
    Probate Law, International Law, [Dark] Human Rights and
    - then they will set this person up in a situation where they are
      enveloped in contextual "rings"
      - then, the persons ability to defend themselves rests on
        discovering specific key pieces of information of context
      - *BUT IT'S A CATCH-22!!*
        - if they "wake up" and discover what's going on, they are
          said to have known what was happening the whole time and
          thus:
          - in violation of some contract they signed (under duress or
            the influence of drugs) of which they have no copy
          - and a lying sack of shit that's manipulating anything and
            everything they can
      - but, while they are undergoing ex parte proceedings involving
        national security information, they are undoubtedly under
        extreme surveillance
        - and so, as soon as the person becomes more and more aware of
          their situation, they are inherently at a informational
          disadvantage because of the nature of surveillance
        - afaik, *this is how ex parte proceedings are carried out*:
          - Agents,
            [in the legal sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency),
            act surreptitiously to compel the accused to make
            statements in "sharia courts" that indicate the person
            intentionally committed some other acts or statements
            - this is all done in a very obfuscated manner to piece
              together testimony *without the knowledge of the
              accused*
            - if this is so, then it is very likely to be abused
