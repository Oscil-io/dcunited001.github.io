I already covered this in the video series

- VR/AR User Interfaces, Mapping Spaces and Date Roulette

i'm catching up with some of the content i added to the video series
- but i have a ton of new stuff
  - covering VR business models and how the industry will evolve to
    transition from VR to AR.

#### Why am I so excited about VR?

- because it makes technology human again
- all that high bandwidth data that’s missing in textual interactions?
- it’s back.  facial expressions? body language? tone of voice?
- VR interactions include those

#### 3 questions 4 VR/AR:

- what is the equivalent of the browser?
- what is the equivalent of streaming video?
- what is the Twitter of VR/AR?

## Example Apps

- explain that I'll include some app ideas in each section of the
  series
  - explain that there's a difference between what makes a killer app
    for VR and for AR


#### Super Smash Maker

(move up to top as an example of an augmented experience)

you could create a platform game or a Super Smash Brother's level with
objects on a table. you can use gestures to cut and paste template
objects and create a new level to use temporarily. the template
objects could be anything: a piece of paper or a cup or pocket
change. when you specify a gesture or command, the object is cut and
paste as you design your level. from there, you can stretch, color or
move the virtual objects around and apply behavior to them. getting
this to work well would require having room equipped with the right
sensors and it would definitely be a challenge.

#### VR blind dates: chat roulette or air time for VR

- be matched up with other people for a five minute talk
- you pop in and out of quick 5 minute interactions with other
    people
- i'm not really passionate enough about it to work on it
  - so i don’t know that I want to work on it.
- however, it’s a good example of a new experience that’s possible with VR

#### AR/VR - How Are They Really Going to Work?

how are VR and AR really going to work?

I’ve spent some time thinking about this
- so it’s easy to map identical spaces in VR
- think about a coffee shop or some local business that has several
  identical VR rooms
  - customers get coffee and can connect with friends across the world
- because the rooms are identical, it’s easy to map a virtual
  experience in one location
  - to a virtual experience in another location

#### why AR is way more interesting than VR

virtual reality is a bit antisocial
- you can't see other people unless they are in your virtual
  experience, which requires time to configure
  - if you're headset has a 3D camera, this isn't too much of a
    problem because it can overlay on top of that, but oculus does
    not.
- i don't understand why there's not a 3D camera with hardware
  mesh/voxelization in the oculus. maybe this isn't so easy. i'm sure
  these guys thought of this stuff.
  - some of the ideas i have for hardware, software and business
    models address these concerns. VR/AR will change in its
    implementation over the next decade.
  - this means the hardware will cycle in and out. i don't think the
    way it's packaged now makes sense, but more on that in the
    business article
