### This Intro Is Old

This first blog is mainly an intro where I'm catching up with some of
the content I added covered the video series
[Why You Should Give Me a Billion Dollars](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEJEA9mYfeKjEbBxmiHEHpLcqnx5DIrYr).

No one ever watched that video series because it was produced by
*David Conner* and that piece of shit isn't allowed to win anything,
not an election or an invisible court case and definitely, definitely
not a cofounder. Jesus Christ, keep him broke! We do not want him ever
amounting to *anything* that has *beyond a modicum of indirect
influence!* If you ever associate with that piece of shit, the only
thing you'll get is a ...

> So, that's a NO. All this illusory bullshit was always intended to
> keep me quiet. And *that*, my friends, _is_ *how I know*. No, I
> don't need evidence. Who does? What is this a court case or some
> shit?  *That's nooz to me!*

Let me emphacize that I have a problem with a society architected to
dispense retribution to anything but unwavering, unquestioning
obedience, regardless of that person's integrity or how much value
they have contributed. To not properly acknowledge sacrifice, talent,
good-naturedness, or integrity begs a moral delimma. The rest this is
about ideas for VR/AR Software, Hardware, Networking, Platforms and
Business Models should leave you scratching your head.

Ahh OK, so now we've moved past the introductory filter device, which
ensures the only people still reading are the people who might give me
a fair chance. Because lets face it: if you disagree me, you're not
going to buy into what I just said. And would I want you to derive
value from my ideas, even though I will never be allowed to amount to
*anything?* Hell no! I do this for the lulz, plain and simple. At this
point, I am simply *trolling* all the little shitdicks who cheered on
my race to the bottom who can't wipe the brown stains off their little
zebra pencildicks. You better get pinesol, comet, and steel wool, my
little ineffective buddy. Keep tellin yourself that it's the motion of
the brushin, but depending on how you've said what you've said, that
mucks going to be a bit hard to brush off. And I'm the guy that may or
may not have been the target of a decade-long, systematic campaign to
discredit me. Instead, I would invite those people to just click that
little X button on the tab to close it. And you're damn right you
will. Do not continue reading if you never intend to give me a fair
shot in life!  !@#$ YOU, in particular, good sir. Yes, you!

# No, Not *You!*

#### Thank You Very Much For Your Support, Continuing Readers!

All I ever wanted was the shot to project my name and life out there
and for people to actually give me a fair chance. And in a strange
way, I got it. How'd I do it? By baiting my enemies into arrogantly
increasing their attacks by falsely confirming the labels they so
secretly placed on my head! I got them to blind themselves with the
muck of their own campaign to discredit me! TROLOLLOL LALA RURU!
... K, moving on, I swears. But, what would you do? How would you wash
it off? To get that muck off from years of this crap? A decade of
integrity rotting in the face of lies! That person *you think you
know?* Like Shaggy would say *"it wasn't me!"*

That video series that no one watched is full of billions of dollars
of ideas, spanning various industries and intellectual property like
Music Production, Artificial Intelligence, 3D Algorithms, . It
contains ideas that would *transform* the medical and genomics ideas.
FOR FREE! *C.O.D. NO MONEY DOWN, MY HOMEY!* There are at least a dozen
$100M ideas in 90 minutes of footage.

And yes, I submitted my youtube footage for an academy award, as a
quasi-documentary!  So, if you really want to help me, tweet
**[@TheAcademy](https://twitter.com/TheAcademy)** and tell them to
nominate my Youtube series. Send them the playlist link *and gimme the
nomnoms* **for great lulz!** This is cause, worthy of your adoration:
it's for great lulz, my friends! They just added a category for
internet videos, actually. In time for 2017! I don't care about the
money, I never did! If I had money, I'd commit nearly 100% of it for
investment and ultimately charity. Think about this: it would be a
foundation along the lines of Nobel's wealth.

All I want? Good food; good travels; influence; good times. That's
all. I don't need anything else! For there is NO person in history who
has ever truly stood in my shoes? Why would I want the money? I want
the thing *no one has ever had*. Duh! You can't buy this stuff, you
really can't.

So yes, this article is a summary of the content of

- but i have a ton of new stuff
  - covering VR business models and how the industry will evolve to
    transition from VR to AR.

#### Why am I so excited about VR?

- because it makes technology human again
- all that high bandwidth data that’s missing in textual interactions?
- it’s back.  facial expressions? body language? tone of voice?
- VR interactions include those

#### 3 questions 4 VR/AR:

- what is the equivalent of the browser?
- what is the equivalent of streaming video?
- what is the Twitter of VR/AR?

## Example Apps

- explain that I'll include some app ideas in each section of the
  series
  - explain that there's a difference between what makes a killer app
    for VR and for AR


#### Super Smash Maker

(move up to top as an example of an augmented experience)

you could create a platform game or a Super Smash Brother's level with
objects on a table. you can use gestures to cut and paste template
objects and create a new level to use temporarily. the template
objects could be anything: a piece of paper or a cup or pocket
change. when you specify a gesture or command, the object is cut and
paste as you design your level. from there, you can stretch, color or
move the virtual objects around and apply behavior to them. getting
this to work well would require having room equipped with the right
sensors and it would definitely be a challenge.

#### VR blind dates: chat roulette or air time for VR

- be matched up with other people for a five minute talk
- you pop in and out of quick 5 minute interactions with other
    people
- i'm not really passionate enough about it to work on it
  - so i don’t know that I want to work on it.
- however, it’s a good example of a new experience that’s possible with VR

#### AR/VR - How Are They Really Going to Work?

how are VR and AR really going to work?

I’ve spent some time thinking about this
- so it’s easy to map identical spaces in VR
- think about a coffee shop or some local business that has several
  identical VR rooms
  - customers get coffee and can connect with friends across the world
- because the rooms are identical, it’s easy to map a virtual
  experience in one location
  - to a virtual experience in another location

#### why AR is way more interesting than VR

virtual reality is a bit antisocial
- you can't see other people unless they are in your virtual
  experience, which requires time to configure
  - if you're headset has a 3D camera, this isn't too much of a
    problem because it can overlay on top of that, but oculus does
    not.
- i don't understand why there's not a 3D camera with hardware
  mesh/voxelization in the oculus. maybe this isn't so easy. i'm sure
  these guys thought of this stuff.
  - some of the ideas i have for hardware, software and business
    models address these concerns. VR/AR will change in its
    implementation over the next decade.
  - this means the hardware will cycle in and out. i don't think the
    way it's packaged now makes sense, but more on that in the
    business article
