# [Space: Economics and Evolution of Governance Mechanisms](#space-economics-and-evolution-of-governance-mechanisms)

Eventually, value added to society by smart-grid and consumer behavior
metrics may begin to surpass the value of oil, especially in an
economy with a altered set of fundamentals. What lubricates both
capacity and efficiency of product exchange? Oil. However, in an
information economy, there are more virtual products and information
is leveraged to make purchasing decisions.

3D printing and nano create radically a different economic situation,
which isn't covered in these posts.  At first, the economic response
to commercialized space is strongly affected by proximity to resources
inbound from space and terrestrial pricing of equivalent resources.

- mention the conflict theory article.
  - identify why space may lead to a post-post-westphalian transition

### access to space becomes critical to a renewables economy

- at least, until humanity has access to space, capacity for energy
  production requires space. this is true, almost first and foremost.
  - i.e. if you don't have space (surface area on earth) you can't
    produce large quantities of energy
    - this is why island nations with large
      [CZ](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/gcil_maritime.html) &
      [EEZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone)
      have both:
      - (1) capacity for wind (& solar? maybe ... dependends on
        engineering specifics i.e. durability)
      - (2) capacity for carbon cleanup by reducing quantities of
        dissolved CO2 via access to large swaths of ocean.
    - and by "first and foremost" i mean that the quantity of energy a
      nation or tract of land can produce is a (multiplicative)
      *product* of *at least* the area (or volume in some cases) of
      space available
  - the economic mechanics here are *similar* to that of food
    production. to produce food, you must first *at least* have
    land. no land no food.
    - but, with renewables, now land that can't be used for food can
      at least be used for energy production. this stabalizes the
      value of land for nations that have, until recently, been
      screwed by fate of geography & resource distribution.

- therefore, access to space becomes critical in an economy which is
  increasingly driven by resource availability and price
  - to this end, nano-based waste reclamation becomes enticing 4
    countries w/ landfills
  - there's a procession of real-estate trends that emerge as various
    space technologies become viable
  - whether/when space elevator tech becomes available, then this
    real-estate becomes valuable
    - this tech is dependent on carbon nano-fibers
    - the valuable land here is equatorial land, which stands in
      contrast to trend whereby arctic and antarctic land becomes
      valuable for unexploited resources (this is a bit of a side
      trek)
      - but honestly, it'd be wise to hold off as long as possible
        before tapping those resources IF EVER
        - it's kind of like robbing santa claus (but not really)
        - would you rob chris cringle? it's really not that bad
          though. however, with better technology, humanity would be
          much better equipped to tap these resources without
          interfering with the environment, which is at least one
          reason why we should wait.

### Commercialized Space Travel's Influence on Large Scale Real-Estate Trends

- (from speculative history article)
- equatorial regions valuable as ideal locations for both:
  - geostationary space elevators
  - space launch locations
- and therefore, there is a gravitation towards the north/south
  poles for resources, followed by a counter-trend of gravitation
  towards the equator for both sending/receiving resources to/from
  space
- depending on the engineering specifics of space elevators, some
  equatorial regions may be more or less valuable than others
- there are also quasi-geostationary space elevators, augmented with
  basic propulsion.
  - these are easier to build because they don't require as much
    nano-tech.
    - i.e. solar sail + ion propulsion upwards, while dangling a
      space-elevator downwards, so it's always falling but always
      moving upwards.
      - combine this with a means of getting stuff 20km into the air
        and you have yourself a space elevator that doesn't need to
        overcome the tension requirements that are prohibiting us from
        obtaining one now
    - this isn't exactly a new idea, but it is likely that something
      like this will be the first kind of space elevator


### space-faring institutions establish sovereignty using transnationalism

- more on this....
- transnationalism is one of the most important concepts we can be
  feeling out right now. because it was new as hell to me (and a bit
  scary, actually!!!)
  - they need to be declared as transnational entities, politically,
    because of their massive cost structures and their need to
    flexibly reposition themselves in anticipation of unpredictable
    global economic trends



# [Trends in International Law are Gaining Momentum](#trends-in-international-law-are-gaining-momentum)

- international norms => policy on AI & usages & limitations
  - analogy for cyber/infowar w/ epidemic

### At Birth, Every Individual has a Tabula Rasa of Legal Rights/Obligations

- Every individual has a Nearly "tabula rasa" set of rights, at birth
  - that is, there are some
- As I understand an US Citizen or Individual's rights in
- arguments from the information warfare articles:

### Transnationals Should Always At Least Have Human Rights

- it seems it's possible for people to declared to have no rights,
  secretly. These people should always have some inalienable human
  rights.
  - they do: refugee rights

#### Circumvention of Genevaless NEC status via an annex-by-proxy

- here is presented a hypothetical international law framework for
  circumventing blacked-out, memory-holed status of non-enemy
  combatants through an annex-by-proxy process
  - are there more notes to this? the point to this idea was to create
    a means by which allys of the US could help NEC's in the US
    while technically not aggressing against the US
    - but without more notes, i can't remember what the rest of this
      was. ahh adderal...
  - a federated non-nation would be created internationally that would
    enable people to petition to declare some land annexed by this
    non-nation
    - this is a non-traditionally defined nation: basically a
      federation of loosely affiliated exclaves

### International Policy for IAC & NIAC, with respect to Transnationalism

- The architects of international policy and law on human rights
  missed a spot and it's a quite concerning...
- according to Harvard ILJ and/or US Naval War College, there are
  major differences in how sections of UN/Geneva policy apply to IAC's
  & NIAC's
  - i.e. IAC/NIAC: international & non-international armed conflicts
  - the Geneva Convention and UN Charter only require adherence to
    human rights norms for IAC's
    - the implementation for the international basis of human rights
      differs in IAC's vs. NIAC's
    - NIAC's basically aren't covered (not by certain sections of the
      geneva convention & UN charter that define the legal basis of
      those norms)
- this is why the concept of transnationalism is very scary
  indeed. it's the breakdown of the westphalian paradigm, which has
  held steadfast the notions themselves of statehood
  - the westphalian paradigm is what is responsible for those lines on
    a map that define a nation. as international law is concerned now,
    the only confusion that arises over the distinction b/w nations is
    when territory of a nation is disputed b/w nations.
  - i.e. nations are defined geographically iff the westphalian
    paradigm is accepted as a norm, but if/when it begins to break
    down, then the idea itself of statehood becomes something which is
    less clearly defined
    - With the westphalian paradigm, nations are geographically bound.
      you can be a Dutch citizen standing in the Netherlands and
      you're clearly a Dutch citizen standing on Dutch soil, where
      Dutch laws apply to you (local/provincial/federal)
      - for this Dutch citizen, some international law applies as well
      - but if this man travels to the UK, then clearly, the UK's laws
        begin to apply (and in some circumstances, the man's
        home-state's laws could also restrict his rights to some
        degree, even in the UK)

- the concept of transnationalism causes the westphalian paradigm to
  begin to break down. transnationalism makes it less clear how laws
  and treaty provisions apply.
  - if you have your citizenship revoked as a US citizen, what laws
    apply to you?
    - if this is for national security purposes, then would you even
      know whether your rights as a US Citizen have become forfeit?
      - you answered "yes, of course!" didn't you
      - are you sure? are you really sure that you would know your
        rights had been restricted?
  - according to some international law scholars (with whom i'm not
    sure I agree in principle, etc.)
    - transnationalism eventually evolves into postnationalism, which
      is kind of a globalist wetdream, but may also just be where the
      world has evolved by the 22nd century (or maybe the 23rd)
    - transnationalism is an *unbelievably vague* concept that can
      have very different meanings and legal implications, depending
      on the context.
  - as the westphalian paradigm begins to lose it's grip in the minds
    of those who hold power in nations, then this vague notion of
    transnationalism begins to manifest itself as an "in between
    state" of "nation" and "non-nation"
    - it becomes less clear what a nation "is" and especially so when
      one realizes that almost every sane, well-learned person thinks
      of the United States as a "place" and not as a "legal entity"
      under the purview of some higher authority
- what provoked my exploration of this? the concepts of authority and
  legitimacy to international law/policy/institutions
  - what authority does an international institution actually hold?
    why? how can one compel such an institution to change its policies
    or their implementation, if they are claimed to be unfair?
    - there are tons of very good questions here, if you want to get
      your feet wet, with regard to international law.
    - i never expected myself to become interested in Military Law or
      Maritime Law, but I've downloaded the UN Law of the Sea treaty
      (unsigned by US) as well as the DoD's 1,200+ page review of US
      Military Law, as the DoD has interpreted it.
  - but once i dipped my toe into the waters of international law &
    transnationalism, hundreds of questions flooded into my mind.
    - suddenly, nothing was clear.

### International Regulation of Supply Chains

- There is a fantastic Harvard ILJ article on this specific issue,
  which is absolutely fascinating. In terms of novel-information
  density (i.e. the percentage of content new to me) this single
  article may have accelerated my general level of knowledge more than
  any other writing I've ever consumed.
  - that is, this single article stimulated my own imagination more
    than anything else I have ever read and did so in terms of each:
    - number/kind of specific fields covered and the quantity/quality
      of new information
  - that International Supply Chain article isn't the only such
    article I've consumed in the past 3 months which has accelerated
    my acquisition of knowledge to personally unknown levels.
- TODO: what about it?
  - how is it difficult? how does international supply chain
    regulation affect cost structures and the incentivization of
    corporate behavior?

# Transnationalism

### TransNatl: In the context of the Westphalian Paradigm

- transition from the
  [westphalian paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty)
  could end up being very messy: politically, culturally, and
  economically.
  - some of the people architecting this know it, to varying degrees
  - this takes place b/w 2015-2050
    - if approached in the right way (i.e. WITH *COMMUNICATION* and
      *TIME*) then it's probably not that bad


### UN As "root" in the network of subgraphs of power structures

- this is a perspective i'm using to feel out my own understanding of
  international law & institutions
  - UN as "root" in the network of subgraphs of power structures
    - not that it's "root" in terms of authority
      - a la linux ~~ super-user
    - but root as in uppermost in totality
- reference harvord international law journal idea about
  transnationalism and the "multi-hub" architecture of overlapping
  transnational soveriegnty (i think)
  - but, with this perspective, then authority becomes shared/tiered
    and there are overlapping degrees (& tiers) of sovereignty
    - this is already happening by the way, but there are good and bad
      ways to transition into such a state
      - i.e. it may take centuries for this to occur "naturally"
      - literally centuries

### international trade agreements

- the three T's trade agreements are an example of such an overlapping
  structure of sovereignties, but i'm just not sure that's the right
  idea
  - there may be no greater power than the power to regulate trade
    - EVERYTHING RELATES TO COMMERCE
      - and possibly descends from commerce

- 3 T's Trade agreements below the UN to establish dominance over
  trade to stifle the pheonomenon of "plurality" and complexity begot
  from plurality in series of Bilateral Trade Agreements
  - this was just an idea i was feeling out by imagining UN as "root"
    and these three tiered, overlapping degrees of sovereignty
    descending from it (relating to the harvard ILJ multi-hub paper)
    - however, i am not, in any way, saying this is the way it should
      be or even trying to put this out there (though i am, i guess)
      - i don't think we should go dissolving notions and
        implementations of sovereignty
      - like i said, these kinds of trends take centuries

- complexity of bilateral trade agreements leading to a "deadlock" in
  ISDS settlements and reduced flexibility in policy.
  - this leads to a situation similar to early 20th century Europe,
    where secret agreements between nations led to poorly informed
    policy decisions
  - ISDS is complex and leads to a degridation of sovereignty by
    locking out legislature-directed policy in lieu of policy directed
    by interests of foreign investors and multinations

### TransNatl: In the context of Trade/ISDS & Federal Law

- ISDS
  - US Code
  - TPP/TKIP
  - Saudi Law (the 9-11 bill)
    - this law was written in a VERY dubious manner
    - and passed like 97-1 !!!
    - POSSIBLE MEDIA BAIT-AND-SWITCH ... IMO
    - yeh, i'm not even !@#$'ing kidding read that bill
  - National Security Laws
  - trade & treaty agreements

### examples of multi-hub (overlapping) international agreements

- these kinds of agreements can act as subgraphs in a multi-hub
  architecture of global institutions
  - again, i'm not saying this is how it should be. i'm mostly trying
    to explore these concepts, so i can more properly conceptualize
    them

- trade: NAFTA/TPP/TTIP
  - eughh...
- regional policy agreements (environmental/industrial/etc)
- technology/IP agreements
- strategic/military
- and more, no doubt

### NAFTA/TPP Chapter 11

- how do the ISDS clauses differ? do they both cover non-state
  individuals?
  - what status do non-enemy combatants have?
    - IMO, if you don't have the rights of a citizen, you are not a
      citizen, but you should still fall under the authority of NAFTA
    - and therefore, if THE GOVERNMENT PROVABLY DEPRIVED YOU of
      opportunities by abusing law and skirting on human rights
      issues, you should be able to SUE THE FUCK OUT OF THEM IN AN
      INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION SUIT
    - particularly, if your business is owned by an individual who is
      not a citizen and was intended to be used as a launching pad for
      opportunities of which you were provably and forcibly deprived,
      you should be able to SUE THE FUCK OUT OF THE AMERICAN
      GOVERNMENT ... maybe
      - obviously, you're going to need a really good lawyer. like a
        dozen of them, which sucks, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SUBJECTED
        YOU TO PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE AND DEPRIVED YOU OF ECONOMIC
        OPPORTUNITIES
        - *so basically, your life better be a great goddamn charity
          case, because otherwise you are shit out of luck.*

# Global Geopolitical Analysis

### South China Sea

- china's motivations for action include expansion of geopolitical
  boundaries to fuel several decades of conflict.
  - this change with geopolitically destabalize the entire oceanic
    region! and also, china, which for most of its history, has only
    cared about china, geographically
    - that's an oversimplification, but for a very long time, conflict
      there has been contained to that region (AFAIK. i'm not a
      scholar on asiatic history)
- i can't really elaborate on this

### Russia/Ukraine

- reference articles on russia

### Middle East

### Balancing It Out

Because opportunities are not being so stagnated in South America and
Africa, we should be establishing strong ties in these places. China
is. We can't let China outpace our diplomacy in Africa because Africa,
as made obvious above, is a major source large-scale demand for
investment and infrastructure products. Therefore, Africa is going to
increase sharply in significance from 2020 through 2050, economically
and politically. Africa is going to remember who helps them out
through this time when they start investing in infrastructure like
never before.

India is also incredibly important in the global economy because they
are a nation of one billion powering itself through an industrial
transformation. The dynamics of this transformation differ greatly
from that of China's industrial transformation because India can
supply both ends of the supply/demand equation and is much more likely
to be able to help themselves through this. China fueled it's decade
long stint of double digit GDP growth with American consumerism and
American debt. India doesn't need to do that, but needs access to
Asian markets through the South Sea. This global shift in the economy
is going to make Singapore much more relevant, although the benefits
of this may fall moreso to China if they pull off this South Sea
bullshit.

# Misc

### Universal Real ID Measures Render Cover Identities Nearly Impossible

- once countries stabalize systems like Real-ID, this manufactuing
  cover identities that other countries can't validate nearly
  impossible
  - further, social media data can be sifted to identify false
    identities because every forged identity will have an inconsistent
    level or quality of data associated with it
  - it becomes very difficult to create this data without your
    opponents being able to identify possible spies
    - which is why sociocultural pushes for people to restrict usage
      of social media has been important thus far.
      - enough low-data social media accounts increases implicit cover
        for actual spies

### fusion

- "game-ending. if you get fusion, you win the game." 'nuff said

### supply chain "dimension"

- supply chain dimension of the American & Global Economies
  - reference arguments from article on regulating conflict minerals
    trade in african nations
  - elaborate on mechanics/dynamics of shifting supply chains
    - especially in the context of novel materials/fabrication tech

- structure of entities/costs/markets in the medical industry
  - in context of research, change in regulation to facilitate faster
    research and faster time-to-market
  - in the context of miracle treatments, turning formerly untreatable
    illnesses into trivially treated ones. Or rendering prohibitively
    expensive treatments into worthlessly broken profit machines.
  - it makes a big difference on the size of health care in proportion
    to other units in the American and global economies.
- the tale of asclepius, who almost cured every disease and was thus
  struck down my zeus, who feared the immortality of man.
  - people have been aware of the problems inherent in the economics
    of medicine for a long, long time.

- TODO: include thoughts on bill gate's idea to tax some form of
  automation
  - it's a good idea to promote economic stability in the context of
    the changed that the 21st century economy will undergo via 3D
    printing, etc.
  - however, the challenge is codifying it into law in a way that is
    fair, simple and not government micromanagement of the economy.
    - that's not to say it's impossible or impractical, just that it's
      a challenge


# Universal Basic Income

> I'm not trying to win a popularity contest here.

UBI is attractive because it appears to meet certain inevitable needs.
Automation will eventually create sky-high unemployment rates, thereby
triggering social unrest. However, the second and third order effects
of UBI's implementation are catastrophic, so it is incredibly unwise
to assume UBI to be an inevitable economic development. It is not the
need for UBI that is exigent, but the need to handle unavoidably high
rates of unemployment.

Why do you hear so much from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs about UBI?
Because they recognize the effects their products will unavoidably
have on labor markets and are wise enough to position themselves in
anticipation. Computational complexity of specific problems determines
the degree to which automation affects the economy, as well as this
trend's timing, pacing and completeness. Additionally, the
availability and applicability of quantum computing causes a second
major wave in the trend of automation.

- bitter medicine

### The Employer of Last Resort

The correct answer is an option for universal service. That is, the
government becomes the employer of last resort. This solution avoids
product-classification, artificial regulation of markets, the
complexity of what is effectively a dual currency system and all the
resulting economic distortion.

# The Pragmatic Implementation of UBI

- food stamps and UBI

### Product Classifications and Restriction of UBI Expenditures

UBI just will not work without mechanisms in place to ensure that
people spend UBI on actual living expenses. It requires infrastructure
for monitoring purchases and reprimanding abuses of UBI income.
Without restricting UBI expenditures, there will be individuals and
groups who will siphon away the government liquidity injected into
society. Those groups include your friendly neighborhood drug dealer
as well as corporations like Starbucks selling lattes for $5.

### UBI is a Pseudo Currency

The system of product classifications essentially creates an economic
system with two currencies. Instead of a simple dollar *for all debts,
public and private*, the dollar becomes the currency of the rich and
employed, who can buy whatever they want. For the rest of us, an
actual UBI policy meant to mitigate unintended consequences instead
produces another unintended consequence: a pseudo-currency. The UBI
dollar is not for all debts, public and private. It is for all debts
that are valid living expenses. This essentially turns the government
into your mom, who might give you money as long as it is spent on
something she knows you really need.

### Product Classification Determines Marketability

Think about the implications of this in context with the UBI's raison
d'etre. Our country would only ever consider UBI because we need to
mitigate the effects of unemployment rates ranging from 10 - 50%.
Without some policy in place to handle the second and third order
effects of automation, unemployment rates such as these are realistic
for the 2030's. If UBI is the policy utilized to ameliorate this, then
for 10 - 50% of the population without full-time employment, their
income is almost completely in UBI pseudo-dollars.  The set of
products a UBI-dependent person can purchase is almost totally limited
to government-approved products.

### UBI is a Big Government Nightmare

If the government restricts the purchasing power of a major segment of
population, this means that only UBI-approved products are viable in
the marketplace. To increase the marketability of products in a UBI
system, then lobbying to have it approved can make or break your
business model. This inserts bureaucracy into every facet of life. In
a very simple way, gives the government an unimaginable amount of
power and sets up the government to be used as a tool to achieve
economic ends. So, what happens?

### The Lobbyists Win

What results? A massive incentive to lobby for the reclassification of
products and to enact major changes in UBI policy implementation. In a
UBI system, what's worth lobbying for? Increased marketability. Yet,
restricting the purchasing power of UBI via product classification is
the only way the government can fairly dispense cash to the
chronically unemployed without having the liquidity spent on Starbucks
lattes and other vices. If the corporate lobbyists win and everything
is classified as a UBI product, it doesn't work. And on the flip side,
a dual-currency system where nothing is marketable unless lobbied to
regulators Washington places power in the hands of regulators and
causes economic turbulence.

### Regulation and the Vulnerability of Democracy to Subversion

Regulatory frameworks can be manipulated via suggestion or outright
subversion, amplifying inefficiencies in tightly regulated markets.
This leads to a less competitive domestic economy, compared to other
players in the global economy. Manipulating regulatory rules and the
institutions that create them is a weapon in economic warfare. This
weapon becomes more powerful as the degree of amplification that
second and third order effects via regulatory rules have on markets.
Additionally, the number of regulatory rules needed in a UBI system
grows as the system evolves.

Worst of all, even if groups or corporations don't
leverage regulation as a tool for economic manipulation, the
government is unable to perform its responsibilities. This leads to
inefficient markets, fluctuating prices for both products and
financial assets, and general price increases for products across the
economy.

### UBI Decentivizes and Stagnates Innovation

Disappointing NEET's and basement dwellers nationwide, the pragmatic
implementation of UBI creates economic turbulence and renders the
domestic economy vulnerable to global competition. The regulation
deincentivizes innovation and stagnates the process by which
innovative new products can become marketable.

Business is about developing assumptions in contrast to the prevailing
understanding that enables someone to posture their product or service
in anticipation of changing trends. This aspect of business is
fundamental. The shifting long-term objectives and confusing
implementation details of UBI policy, as they are commonly understood
by the public, lead to an inability to make lasting assumptions about
economic trends. In anticipation of shifting policy that invalidates
these assumptions, investors and entrepreneurs evaluating a business
model will mostly refrain from investing. There's no point in
financing a business whose model is invalidated by policy changes,
potential or inevitable.

Generally, any detraction from the ability to make valid predictive
assumptions that hold true over time impairs the identification and
execution of economically viable opportunities. Cost and risk become
difficult to measure or are measured using a model invalidated by
future policy changes. If one can assume that there are no policy
changes, then investors have a much larger risk appetite, which leads
to higher growth amid stable policy conditions. Heavily regulated
environments with high policy turnover, high barrier to entry and an
inherently limited market do not promote innovation.

These generalizations about business are related to
[induction puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_puzzles),
where the ability to make assumptions via inductive logic allows one
to carve away at the problem space. One uses induction to
combinatorially evaluate valid configurations of the system. If
induction is required, then the difficulty of the problem is
exponentially more complex. Potential policy changes essentially add
variables to be combinated with induction. That's why you should
diversify your asset portfolio.

# UBI is Catastrophic to Capitalism

Capitalism essentially harnesses the same math behind machine learning
to create evolutionary dynamics. These "reified maths" form the
invisible hand that confers advantage to the best marketed, best
formulated or best packaged products. Free market systems reduce
inefficiencies in an economy, delivering more value to citizens
domestically and making the economy more competitive globally.

A poor implementation of UBI will trigger a collapse of capitalism.
Captilism isn't capitalism at all when an authority artificially and
severely restricts choice. This places enormous power in the hands of
regulators in Washington and the lobbyists who court them. The
regulators decide who wins and who loses in a market and they are
inept at doing so. The scale of inefficiency increases which causes an
aggregate increase in prices across all types of products, since any
product on the economy has a list of component products. So, price
increases are higher for the consumer because those products are
higher up the food chain, so to speak.

This dynamic creates a feedback loop between the mechanisms for
estimating the amount of UBI required and the amplification that UBI
regulation has on both product prices and market efficiency.

# The Progression of Automation in Labor Markets

The perceived and actual ROI of employment roles depends on the degree
to which each role's tasks can be automated. For roles involving a
more complicated arrangement of tasks, the ability to completely
automate that role is inherently diminished. The structuring of roles
to task types changes as the labor markets evolve. Generally, if an
employment role involves a simpler set of task types, that role can be
automated away more quickly. If the set of task types is more complex,
there is a greater need for generalized AI. For each task type, the
complexity of the solutions nearly completely determines its potential
to be automated.

### Uber

- Uber is a perfect example of how automation gradually overtakes
  employment roles within a business or industry.
  - Uber essentially automated the taxi dispatcher and the task of
    navigation for drivers.
  - Once the problem of driving is tractibly solved, it would appear
    economically advantageous to automate the driver. Uber may decide
    that it wants to continue offering drivers or some such
    formulation of its product, since a driver affects the customer
    experience.
    - Also, with drivers, Uber has a platform composed of people
      invested in Uber's success. These drivers also act as vectors
      for propagating dynamics through social networks (i.e. marketing).
  - So, the point is, there are roles which can be automated, where
    automation appears to pay off on the surface. Yet, in the long
    term, automation may instead strongly detract from certain aspects
    of your business and product, especially the customer experience.
    Total automation removes human social dimensions from your
    product. Factors like these were ubiquitous before the 21st
    century, so effects from their presence or absence in a product is
    not well understood.

### Mental Labor

It's a common assumption, but mental labor is not safe. In fact, these
are some of the easiest and most effective roles to automate. For
roles involving mental labor, a trend will be to automate stages in
the role's decision making process, exposing vital data points in a
user interface. From there it's mostly thumbs up or thumbs down: the
employee in the mental labor role makes decisions as data is presented
to them. This essentially harnesses as
[dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction),
which is required for mitigating computational complexity in machine
learning.

With respect to dimensionality reduction, the curse of dimensionality
is not kind to humanity in the age of automation, where it before
allowed us to solve problems which would otherwise be intractible. For
almost any task type, if the most complete analytical solution is
intractible, there is almost certainly an efficient formulation
involving clustering and dimensionality reduction. This forms the
basis of a tractible analytical approximation to the original
solution.

Of course, there is no actual connection between the two. But without
needing to understanding the connection, a computer can identify
seemingly uncorrelated variables which can be use to construct an
approximate solution. The more data, the more accurately its
construction of approximated solutions can be leveraged.

What that common assumption fails to grasp is the computational
capacity of the human brain, which still outpaces the sum of
computational capacity from all supercomputers on Earth. While user
interface for the human brain is weak and requires years of
conditioning, someone in a mental labor is essentially performing many
of the same tasks that computers would. The human brain is
particularly good at identifying and correlating arbitrary data, which
provide data-processing shortcuts to some solution.

A task type that forms a major dependency of AI-driven businesses is
in the data itself: data science, data processing infrastructure and
user interface. In this way, task types like these will be needed at
ever-increasing rates, but eventually, software, data-science and
infrastructure can all be automated. If someone lacks the equivalent
of a master's degree in either math or a field where math is strongly
applied, they are unlikely to be useful for data-science.


All in all, the labor markets favor those with highly varied skill
sets, which results in a paradox. Whereas automation leaves many
unemployed in an economy where high variety and proficiency of skills
determine employability, UBI as a policy detracts from the incentive
to work and to develop a highly varied set of skills. Why work if you
don't have to? Why learn or hone your skills in a difficult to
understand, ever-changing economy where the potential payout for each
acquired skill decreases year after year? What results is a cultural
feedback loop that magnifies the effect that automation has on the set
of behaviors humans reinforce. Those with highly varied skill sets
remain employable and work to create tools which render their own
skills obselete.

What's left is a socioeconomic structure that neither provides
incentives to work nor rewards hard work proportionately, where the
citizens must maintain technology they don't understand built with
skills they mostly lack. They lack these skills because, while they
were in school, education didn't offer a significant perceived
benefit, at least economically. In turn, these cultural trends could
render the domestic economy vulnerable to global competition. Also,
there are interesting intergenerational dynamics that could emerge,
where the oldest generation has the widest variety of skills, which
are mostly not propagated to subsequent generations.

And this all occurs during the same period of time when generalized AI
may develop into a threat.

# The Employer of Last Resort

So we know that high unemployment rates are inevitable, given the
trajectory of technology and its impact on labor markets. We also know
that continued technological development is inevitable because any
alternative implies unsustainable population growth and/or a
transition of economic power to whoever develops the best
technology. So the question we need to ask is: how do we deal with
unemployment and other economic turbulence?

#### Policy Solutions Include:

#### Do nothing

#### Provide UBI (Ubiquitous Income)

#### National Service

I can't stand either of them because they both generally involve
growing the size of government and increasing its range of influence
on our lives. Still, doing nothing is far worse. Both UBI and National
Service are expensive result in wide-reaching second and third order
socioeconomic effects. However, upon examining the potential higher
order effects, one finds that National Service is far preferable. Many
of the advantages of UBI, like opportunity for innovation and
experimentation, can be realized through much smaller grant programs.

### National Service Catalyzes Sociocultural Transformation

Generally, we find that many of these domestic issues and their root
causes could be avoided or prevented outright, if only people were
more educated, responsible, insightful or temperate. How do you
catalyze your population to develop a robust set of knowledge and
skills? To imbibe a set of beliefs that naturally causes them to live
more responsibly? Given the right opportunities, the right incentives
and an accurate understanding of the world, people generally make the
best decisions for themselves and their families. Many of our domestic
problems are a result of ignorance, lack of foresight, myopic desire
and hopelessness.

The root causes of domestic issues in America are best addressed
through cultural transformation. Without such a transformation,
America is sure to succumb to domestic problems, like unrest, poverty,
economic turbulence and unemployment.

National citizen service can be harnessed to imprint a near-universal
experience or widely-shared types of experiences. If these experiences
are common, they form the basis of pattern languages that help us
communicate and diagnose domestic issues. UBI does not provide this
opportunity for cultural transmission or the imprinting of types of
experiences. Unless one assumes the best case to represent the
majority (e.g. that people will react by altruistically using UBI as
an opportunity for personal development instead of hedonism or
netflix), then national service results in much preferable outcomes,
socioculturally. IMO, this altruistic best case would be rare.

### National Service Drives Social Flux and Tightens the Social Graph

- Formation of highly-connected social networks


In the past, religion has been used to imprint experience types and to
encourage social flux, which induces transmission of information and
beliefs amoung its participants. Religious customs that are social,
like regular attendance of church, drive social flux that trigger
permeation of information through social networks.

### National Citizen Service for Young Adults


- Korea and Isreal are both countries which require mandatory military
  service for young adults.
  
- Such mandatory service can be leveraged to develop highly varied
  skill sets, making people more employable.
- utilization of human capital to help build the foundations of
  underdeveloped economies, which provides a framework for economic
  growth in the 21st century



### UBI or National Service Must Be Economically Sustainable

When the government is paying the living expenses of 15 - 50% of the
population, it's hard to imagine this being economically
sustainable. Financing this requires that the government expend either
taxes or credit. If there is correlation between tax volume and
employment, which is certainly the case before the 21st century, then
the government expenditures to mitigate unemployment will be
unsustainable, if not at first, then eventually.

From an entrepreneur's perspective, the purpose of automation is
increase profit margins by reducing costs and improving efficiency.
Yet, a long-term result of automation is unemployment that
necessitates higher government expenditures, increasing the tax burden
on corporations.

One sensible policy option to placate economic turbulence is to tax
the usage of automation, but this paradoxically makes these businesses
less able to compete with those from nations that don't tax
automation. How did globalization affect domenstic manufacturing and
why? Corporations moved overseas because they harnessed the cheapest
source of labor available. That's economics at work and similar
dynamics will be in play if automation is taxed.

If the policy response results in increased economic opportunity,
while enabling American enterprises to remain competitive, then it
will sustainable in the short-term. If it's not sustainable in the
long-term, then hopefully we got something good with all that
money. Ultimately, that will be what we are left with. For example, if
we utilize National Service to rebuild America's infrastructure, then
we have infrastructure. If we utilize National Service to invest in
underdeveloped economies, then American business can leverage those
global markets as a framework for further growth. And, in case of
robot apocalypse, our population has a highly-developed skill set as a
result. But, if we write $30,000 annual checks so that 15 - 50% of our
citizens can watch two-thirds of the Netflix catalog, then we're left
with a population who communicates poorly using sitcom references, but
isn't employable or able to contribute to society.
