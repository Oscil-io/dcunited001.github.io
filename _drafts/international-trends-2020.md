Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) have different
qualities making them useful in consumer electronics. Our electric
grid utilizes AC to transmit power long distances because it's more
efficient than DC. Thanks to Tesla, we didn't have to deal with GE's
plan for local DC switching facilities in a pure DC electric
grid. Incidentally, the power grid of the 21st century looks a lot
more like GE's plan.

The divide between AC and DC moves from the endpoint of consumer
technology to the consumer's house or building. This bridges the gap
for renewables to connect into a consumer's home and is required for
the creation of a viable product platform for renewables. Renewables
require a change in the consumer electric grid -- large changes in the
electric framework running through their home and office. Otherwise,
renewables simply can't be marketed to customers.

For example, the Tesla battery can be easily connected to renewables
such as solar, but isn't so simply and efficiently integrated into a
consumer's home AC circuits. However, if a consumer's home is fully
DC, everything connects quite simply -- the Tesla storage battery and
any renewables that charge it. Therefore there's going to be a huge
technological shift in the parts of the electric grid connect to your
home and office. The divide between AC & DC will be pushed further
out. Until the actual electric grid infrastructure can be replaced, DC
networks will be pushed from the consumer side to the POD (Point of
Demarcation). In countries which are already developed, the evolution
of the smart-grid will be ironically slower, as there will be major
headaches in replacing the infrastructure.

However, to ensure that American interests become leaders in the
manufacture, design and marketing of smart-grid technology, this means
that we need to ensure that there are plenty of stable markets in
developing nations.

### Packet Switching for the Smart Grid

Researchers across the world are revitalizing their interests in power
grid technology and solving many electrical engineering problems that
otherwise lay dormant for decades. To Cisco certified networking
enthusiasts such as myself, one particularly interesting area of smart
grid research is power packet routing. To the layman, this essentially
combines the internet and electric power distribution, so your devices
can be connected to the internet by simply being plugged in. This
helps IoT (internet of things) devices quite a bit.

There will be major economic opportunities in the switching hardware
used for Smart Grid Packet Switching, if this is the direction
infrastructure evolution takes. The hardware, software and business
models would strongly mirror developments in telecom. This will
essentially be the third generation of telecom switching, where the
first was telecom/PBX and the second was internet route/switch
gear. Every home or office that wants to tap into renewables will need
some of this equipment and in America, it will undergo several

Depending on the rollout of other technologies and relevant consumer
behavior, some aspects of smart grid technology may not become
anything more than a good idea. The correct answer here is simplicity
and the problem is designing the next generation of consumer
electronics. Design iteration on these consumer electronics is
incredibly expensive, almost as expensive as maintaining backwards
compatibility. Whether the benefits of new infrastructure outweigh the
costs of implementation in developed countries will determine whether
these technologies will become mainstream.

Power packet switching requires layers of gear similar to Cisco
routers and switches. Furthermore, TDMA-like protocols can send data
and power over the same channel. Enabling this to work with various
voltages, amperages and wattages requires *either* incredibly
complicated component design or standardization of consumer
electronics. The problems that electrical engineers are solving to
create tomorrow's smart-grid are incredibly complicated and just as
urgent for American industry to succeed in the global economy from
2020 through 2040. It is critical to get this right and there quite
likely is a "correct answer" for overarching design problems
here. Whether that correct answer meshes well with the economics of
both smart-grid rollout and renewables is an enigma to me. Green
issues and climate change policy will have a huge effect on the
apparent solutions in the smart-grid infrastructure discussion.

To get an idea of the research being conducted in this field, check
out this IEEE publication:
[IEEE Transactions on Power Systems](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=59). Most
of those studies require payment to access, but that's where you can
find all the critical research being done.

Here is a good introduction into some of the high-level design
concepts used to determine viable smart-grid topologies:
[A Review of Architectures and Concepts for Intelligence in Future Electric Energy Systems](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6915899/). To
understand more about shifting the divide between AC and DC, read this
IEEE publication:
[DC Local Power Distribution: Technology, Deployment, and Pathways to Success](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7480941/).


- TDMA-like switching for units of power with both signaling metadata
    and data sharing the same channel.
  - mention the standard power cable specification being developed
    just for this (380V power cable)
  - analog signal 4 power packets to provide data + power addressed in
    hardware apps w/ power and data transmitted using a TDMA-like
    protocol
  - something like pulse-width shift between digital/analog, where the
    components of electronics time the switching of circuits to route
    temporary power or encoded data

- is there a protocol for encoding Q/FFT (?) transactions in a
  universal way?

- what routing protocols begin to emerge for DC-power-switching?

### Quantum Networking

- quantum netwokring for wireless/powerless metadata communication 4
  smartgrid
  - this allows machine-learning algorithms to be more efficent when
    managing the distribution of power. the speed of light is not a
    limiting factor and for geographically system as large as the
    smart-grid, this matters. further, quantum networking is rarely
    thought about by the common person who does understand the
    rigidity imposed by Special Relativity.
  - cite papers about machine learning and smart grid infrastructure
    switching

- the specifics of quantum networking, particularly whether it's
  convenient, cheap and portable, strongly determines how technology
  will unfold and determines which industries thrive and survive as
  other dependent tech finds its way into the hands of consumers.
  - in other words, quantum networking and its specifics is a huge
    unknown with massive implications on how technology will unfold
  - quantum networking using entangled pairs of particles facilitates
    faster than light communication.
    - its effects on other technology are at first esoteric, hard to
      understand and highly technical
    - at first, it's only beneficial for for massive,
      geo-distributed projects like GPS or the Smart-Grid. whether it
      is useful at all depends on whether the payoffs transcend the
      barriers of its technological implementations, which may include
      superconduction or special cooling requirements.
      - technological breakthroughs here are huge, but very
        unpredictable. therefore, from an investment standpoint, it's
        crucial to maintain flexibility and maintain signals that
        inform you of technological developmetns.
      - certain technological breakthroughs could have vast,
        unpredictable effects on the implementation of technology for
        consumers, for infrastructure and for any interconnected
        software & hardware
  - its difficult to understand the downstream consequences to
    computing caused by a means of communication like the Ansible.

- teleological consequences to the transformation of the electric grid

### The Smart Grid and the Importance of Stability in Developing Nations

  - the AC/DC divide pushes from consumer electronics to homes, cars
    and higher order containments of DC electronics systems with
    capacity for dynamic power managment where current carries power
    AND data.
    - this shift creates trillions in demand for replacement of
      electric grid infrastructure *worldwide* gradually across three
      decades
    - the mechanics of this flux of demand rippling through the global
      economie affect industrialized nations differently than
      developing nations with less infrastructure
      - the nations with more infrastructure to replace do it more
        slowly, which creates a need to gradually shift to new
        infrastructure, requiring backwards compatability.
        - this requirement for backwards compatibility limits the
          payoffs to infrastructure updates, which could mean that
          undeveloped nations are more likely to benefit more quickly
        - in the end, we all end up with mostly the same set of
          capabilities from upgraded smart grid infrastructure, but
          less developed nations are better positioned to receive
          these benefits faster with less cost and less design
          constraints.
        - therefore, the flux of demand will tend to strongly impact
          developing nations, as they get higher payoffs for cheaper,
          as long as there is some threshold of stability.
        - therefore, if the united states can leverage its authority
          as an international power player to compel others to help
          foment stability in these nations, then we can
          simultaneously position ourselves to help supply that
          demand. The demand is a product of the expectation of
          permanent stablity in these nations.
        - therefore, the US helps provide stability and profits from
          the export of electric grid technology, while retaining the
          benefits it receives from the analytics based on smart grid
          consumption analytics and uses this data to stay ahead AND
          help promote the level of stability that makes it all
          possible.

### Interactions b/w the Smart Grid and Real Estate Prices

- there are predictable dynamics in real-estate that result from the
  availability and qualities of smart-grid infrastructure as well as
  incentivizations inherent in the economics of infrastructure
  installation.
  - these are especially present in urban and high rise residential
    areas. Changes in infrastructure here have long-lasting
    consequences, so we're going to want to do this right, so the
    smart-grid platform empowers american industry across the world.
- a building's capacity for renewable energy production is correlated
  to surface area, so as the proportion of volume to surface area
  increases, the likelihood of balanced energy utilization drops
  rapidly.
  - whether this matters depends on whether fusion or alternatives
    like them become available. fusion will become the dominant form
    of energy production later in the 21st century, but the version
    and quality of smart-grid infrastructure for buildings will begin
    to matter regardless, especially if we expect incentivization from
    climate change policies like the Paris Agreement to actually make
    a difference.

- increased demand for smart grid in developed states
  - but also developing states, since they are either upgrading older
    gear and/or installing fresh electric grid gear

- changes to real estate (predictable) based on:
  - (1) renewables & specifics of real-estate
  - (2) potential of real-estate to be upgraded w/ smart grid tech
    - the specific rollout dynamics of such technology
  - (3) the upper bound on renewables wattage for a building
    - e.g. urban buildings have almost no capacity for wind (on top)
      and less capacity for solar, but still have capacity for
      biological-based renewables (though these often require
      sunlight/external energy)
  - (4) capacity for urban food production

- someone can create an event-driven purchasing strategy to profit in
  the billions from predictable changes in real-estate strategy
  - if you can influence policy as it crucially relates to
    real-estate, you can easily profit in the billions
  - but, someone making the wrong moves here could cost america
    trillions. this, however, does not mean that the selfish decisions
    here would necessary contradict america's own interests and
    incentives.

### water, irrigation and desalinization

- smartgrid/renewables become essential for agriculture and
  desalinization
  - many settled areas around the world are running out of water and
    will need to offset their lack of fresh water with desalinized
    water, but there just aren't cheap & efficient ways to do that
    without large amounts of renewable energy, like solar.
    - therefore, if you look at the differential in water consumption
      as a proportion of underground freshwater reserves remaining,
      you'll identify markets who will need renewable-powered
      desalinization in order to produce local food, etc.
  - opportunity for state-funded geoengineering projects, which will
    include those regions mentioned above.
  - an incredibly useful product would be one to consume energy &
    produce water for irrigation.
- desalinization will tend to lower sea-levels, which *raises* the
  proportion of pollutants to sea water, but may not be enough to
  counter polar ice melting.

# [Space: Economics and Evolution of Governance Mechanisms](#space-economics-and-evolution-of-governance-mechanisms)

Eventually, value added to society by smart-grid and consumer behavior
metrics may begin to surpass the value of oil, especially in an
economy with a altered set of fundamentals. What lubricates both
capacity and efficiency of product exchange? Oil. However, in an
information economy, there are more virtual products and information
is leveraged to make purchasing decisions.

3D printing and nano create radically a different economic situation.
At first, the economic response to commercialized space is strongly
affected by proximity to resources inbound from space and terrestrial
pricing of equivalent resources.


- mention the conflict theory article.
  - identify why space may lead to a post-post-westphalian transition

### access to space becomes critical to a renewables economy

- at least, until humanity has access to space, capacity for energy
  production requires space. this is true, almost first and foremost.
  - i.e. if you don't have space (surface area on earth) you can't
    produce large quantities of energy
    - this is why island nations with large
      [CZ](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/gcil_maritime.html) &
      [EEZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone)
      have both:
      - (1) capacity for wind (& solar? maybe ... dependends on
        engineering specifics i.e. durability)
      - (2) capacity for carbon cleanup by reducing quantities of
        dissolved CO2 via access to large swaths of ocean.
    - and by "first and foremost" i mean that the quantity of energy a
      nation or tract of land can produce is a (multiplicative)
      *product* of *at least* the area (or volume in some cases) of
      space available
  - the economic mechanics here are *similar* to that of food
    production. to produce food, you must first *at least* have
    land. no land no food.
    - but, with renewables, now land that can't be used for food can
      at least be used for energy production. this stabalizes the
      value of land for nations that have, until recently, been
      screwed by fate of geography & resource distribution.

- therefore, access to space becomes critical in an economy which is
  increasingly driven by resource availability and price
  - to this end, nano-based waste reclaimation becomes enticing 4
    countries w/ landfills
  - whether/when space elevator tech becomes available, then this
    real-estate becomes valuable
    - this tech is dependent on carbon nano-fibers
    - the valuable land here is equatorial land, which stands in
      contrast to trend whereby arctic and antarctic land becomes
      valuable for unexploited resources (this is a bit of a side
      trek)
      - but honestly, it'd be wise to hold off as long as possible
        before tapping those resources IF EVER
        - it's kind of like robbing santa claus (but not really)
        - would you rob chris cringle? it's really not that bad
          though. however, with better technology, humanity would be
          much better equipped to tap these resources without
          interfering with the environment, which is at least one
          reason why we should wait.

### Commercialized Space Travel's Influence on Large Scale Real-Estate Trends

- (from speculative history article)
- equatorial regions valuable as ideal locations for both:
  - geostationary space elevators
  - space launch locations
- and therefore, there is a gravitation towards the north/south
  poles for resources, followed by a counter-trend of gravitation
  towards the equator for both sending/receiving resources to/from
  space
- depending on the engineering specifics of space elevators, some
  equatorial regions may be more or less valuable than others
- there are also quasi-geostationary space elevators, augmented with
  basic propulsion.
  - these are easier to build because they don't require as much
    nano-tech.
    - i.e. solar sail + ion propulsion upwards, while dangling a
      space-elevator downwards, so it's always falling but always
      moving upwards.
      - combine this with a means of getting stuff 20km into the air
        and you have yourself a space elevator that doesn't need to
        overcome the tension requirements that are prohibiting us from
        obtaining one now
    - this isn't exactly a new idea, but it is likely that something
      like this will be the first kind of space elevator


### space-faring institutions establish sovereignty using transnationalism

- more on this....
- transnationalism is one of the most important concepts we can be
  feeling out right now. because it was new as hell to me (and a bit
  scary, actually!!!)
  - they need to be declared as transnational entities, politically,
    because of their massive cost structures and their need to
    flexibly reposition themselves in anticipation of unpredictable
    global economic trends

# [Trends in International Law are Gaining Momentum](#trends-in-international-law-are-gaining-momentum)

- international norms => policy on AI & usages & limitations
  - analogy for cyber/infowar w/ epidemic

### At Birth, Every Individual has a Tabula Rasa of Legal Rights/Obligations

- Every individual has a Nearly "tabula rasa" set of rights, at birth
  - that is, there are some
- As I understand an US Citizen or Individual's rights in
- arguments from the information warfare articles:

### Transnationals Should Always At Least Have Human Rights

- it seems it's possible for people to declared to have no rights,
  secretly. These people should always have some inalienable human
  rights.
-

### International Policy for IAC & NIAC, with respect to Transnationalism

- The architects of international policy and law on human rights
  missed a spot and it's a quite concerning...
- according to Harvard ILJ and/or US Naval War College, there are
  major differences in how sections of UN/Geneva policy apply to IAC's
  & NIAC's
  - i.e. IAC/NIAC: international & non-international armed conflicts
  - the Geneva Convention and UN Charter only require adherence to
    human rights norms for IAC's
    - the implementation for the international basis of human rights
      differs in IAC's vs. NIAC's
    - NIAC's basically aren't covered (not by certain sections of the
      geneva convention & UN charter that define the legal basis of
      those norms)
- this is why the concept of transnationalism is very scary
  indeed. it's the breakdown of the westphalian paradigm, which has
  held steadfast the notions themselves of statehood
  - the westphalian paradigm is what is responsible for those lines on
    a map that define a nation. as international law is concerned now,
    the only confusion that arises over the distinction b/w nations is
    when territory of a nation is disputed b/w nations.
  - i.e. nations are defined geographically iff the westphalian
    paradigm is accepted as a norm, but if/when it begins to break
    down, then the idea itself of statehood becomes something which is
    less clearly defined
    - With the westphalian paradigm, nations are geographically bound.
      you can be a Dutch citizen standing in the Netherlands and
      you're clearly a Dutch citizen standing on Dutch soil, where
      Dutch laws apply to you (local/provincial/federal)
      - for this Dutch citizen, some international law applies as well
      - but if this man travels to the UK, then clearly, the UK's laws
        begin to apply (and in some circumstances, the man's
        home-state's laws could also restrict his rights to some
        degree, even in the UK)

- the concept of transnationalism causes the westphalian paradigm to
  begin to break down. transnationalism makes it less clear how laws
  and treaty provisions apply.
  - if you have your citizenship revoked as a US citizen, what laws
    apply to you?
    - if this is for national security purposes, then would you even
      know whether your rights as a US Citizen have become forfeit?
      - you answered "yes, of course!" didn't you
      - are you sure? are you really sure that you would know your
        rights had been restricted?
  - according to some international law scholars (with whom i'm not
    sure I agree in principle, etc.)
    - transnationalism eventually evolves into postnationalism, which
      is kind of a globalist wetdream, but may also just be where the
      world has evolved by the 22nd century (or maybe the 23rd)
    - transnationalism is an *unbelievably vague* concept that can
      have very different meanings and legal implications, depending
      on the context.
  - as the westphalian paradigm begins to lose it's grip in the minds
    of those who hold power in nations, then this vague notion of
    transnationalism begins to manifest itself as an "in between
    state" of "nation" and "non-nation"
    - it becomes less clear what a nation "is" and especially so when
      one realizes that almost every sane, well-learned person thinks
      of the United States as a "place" and not as a "legal entity"
      under the purview of some higher authority
- what provoked my exploration of this? the concepts of authority and
  legitimacy to international law/policy/institutions
  - what authority does an international institution actually hold?
    why? how can one compel such an institution to change its policies
    or their implementation, if they are claimed to be unfair?
    - there are tons of very good questions here, if you want to get
      your feet wet, with regard to international law.
    - i never expected myself to become interested in Military Law or
      Maritime Law, but I've downloaded the UN Law of the Sea treaty
      (unsigned by US) as well as the DoD's 1,200+ page review of US
      Military Law, as the DoD has interpreted it.
  - but once i dipped my toe into the waters of international law &
    transnationalism, hundreds of questions flooded into my mind.
    - suddenly, nothing was clear.

### International Regulation of Supply Chains

- There is a fantastic Harvard ILJ article on this specific issue,
  which is absolutely fascinating. In terms of novel-information
  density (i.e. the percentage of content new to me) this single
  article may have accelerated my general level of knowledge more than
  any other writing I've ever consumed.
  - that is, this single article stimulated my own imagination more
    than anything else I have ever read and did so in terms of each:
    - number/kind of specific fields covered and the quantity/quality
      of new information
  - that International Supply Chain article isn't the only such
    article I've consumed in the past 3 months which has accelerated
    my acquisition of knowledge to personally unknown levels.
- TODO: what about it?
  - how is it difficult? how does international supply chain
    regulation affect cost structures and the incentivization of
    corporate behavior?

# Transnationalism

### TransNatl: In the context of the Westphalian Paradigm

- transition from the
  [westphalian paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty)
  could end up being very messy: politically, culturally, and
  economically.
  - some of the people architecting this know it, to varying degrees
  - this takes place b/w 2015-2050
    - if approached in the right way (i.e. WITH *COMMUNICATION* and
      *TIME*) then it's probably not that bad


### UN As "root" in the network of subgraphs of power structures

- this is a perspective i'm using to feel out my own understanding of
  international law & institutions
  - UN as "root" in the network of subgraphs of power structures
    - not that it's "root" in terms of authority
      - a la linux ~~ super-user
    - but root as in uppermost in totality
- reference harvord international law journal idea about
  transnationalism and the "multi-hub" architecture of overlapping
  transnational soveriegnty (i think)
  - but, with this perspective, then authority becomes shared/tiered
    and there are overlapping degrees (& tiers) of sovereignty
    - this is already happening by the way, but there are good and bad
      ways to transition into such a state
      - i.e. it may take centuries for this to occur "naturally"
      - literally centuries

### international trade agreements

- the three T's trade agreements are an example of such an overlapping
  structure of sovereignties, but i'm just not sure that's the right
  idea
  - there may be no greater power than the power to regulate trade
    - EVERYTHING RELATES TO COMMERCE
      - and possibly descends from commerce

- 3 T's Trade agreements below the UN to establish dominance over
  trade to stifle the pheonomenon of "plurality" and complexity begot
  from plurality in series of Bilateral Trade Agreements
  - this was just an idea i was feeling out by imagining UN as "root"
    and these three tiered, overlapping degrees of sovereignty
    descending from it (relating to the harvard ILJ multi-hub paper)
    - however, i am not, in any way, saying this is the way it should
      be or even trying to put this out there (though i am, i guess)
      - i don't think we should go dissolving notions and
        implementations of sovereignty
      - like i said, these kinds of trends take centuries


### TransNatl: In the context of Trade/ISDS & Federal Law

- ISDS
  - US Code
  - TPP/TKIP
  - Saudi Law (the 9-11 bill)
    - this law was written in a VERY dubious manner
    - and passed like 97-1 !!!
    - POSSIBLE MEDIA BAIT-AND-SWITCH ... IMO
    - yeh, i'm not even !@#$'ing kidding read that bill
  - National Security Laws
  - trade & treaty agreements

### examples of multi-hub (overlapping) international agreements

- these kinds of agreements can act as subgraphs in a multi-hub
  architecture of global institutions
  - again, i'm not saying this is how it should be. i'm mostly trying
    to explore these concepts, so i can more properly conceptualize
    them

- trade: NAFTA/TPP/TTIP
  - eughh...
- regional policy agreements (environmental/industrial/etc)
- technology/IP agreements
- strategic/military
- and more, no doubt

### NAFTA/TPP Chapter 11

- how do the ISDS clauses differ? do they both cover non-state
  individuals?
  - what status do non-enemy combatants have?
    - IMO, if you don't have the rights of a citizen, you are not a
      citizen, but you should still fall under the authority of NAFTA
    - and therefore, if THE GOVERNMENT PROVABLY DEPRIVED YOU of
      opportunities by abusing law and skirting on human rights
      issues, you should be able to SUE THE FUCK OUT OF THEM IN AN
      INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION SUIT
    - particularly, if your business is owned by an individual who is
      not a citizen and was intended to be used as a launching pad for
      opportunities of which you were provably and forcibly deprived,
      you should be able to SUE THE FUCK OUT OF THE AMERICAN
      GOVERNMENT ... maybe
      - obviously, you're going to need a really good lawyer. like a
        dozen of them, which sucks, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SUBJECTED
        YOU TO PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE AND DEPRIVED YOU OF ECONOMIC
        OPPORTUNITIES
        - *so basically, your life better be a great goddamn charity
          case, because otherwise you are shit out of luck.*

# Global Geopolitical Analysis

### South China Sea

- china's motivations for action include expansion of geopolitical
  boundaries to fuel several decades of conflict.
  - this change with geopolitically destabalize the entire oceanic
    region! and also, china, which for most of its history, has only
    cared about china, geographically
    - that's an oversimplification, but for a very long time, conflict
      there has been contained to that region (AFAIK. i'm not a
      scholar on asiatic history)
- i can't really elaborate on this

### Russia/Ukraine

- reference articles on russia

### Middle East

### Balancing It Out

Because opportunities are not being so stagnated in South America and
Africa, we should be establishing strong ties in these places. China
is. We can't let China outpace our diplomacy in Africa because Africa,
as made obvious above, is a major source large-scale demand for
investment and infrastructure products. Therefore, Africa is going to
increase sharply in significance from 2020 through 2050, economically
and politically. Africa is going to remember who helps them out
through this time when they start investing in infrastructure like
never before.

India is also incredibly important in the global economy because they
are a nation of one billion powering itself through an industrial
transformation. The dynamics of this transformation differ greatly
from that of China's industrial transformation because India can
supply both ends of the supply/demand equation and is much more likely
to be able to help themselves through this. China fueled it's decade
long stint of double digit GDP growth with American consumerism and
American debt. India doesn't need to do that, but needs access to
Asian markets through the South Sea. This global shift in the economy
is going to make Singapore much more relevant, although the benefits
of this may fall moreso to China if they pull off this South Sea
bullshit.

  automation
  - it's a good idea to promote economic stability in the context of
    the changed that the 21st century economy will undergo via 3D
    printing, etc.
  - however, the challenge is codifying it into law in a way that is
    fair, simple and not government micromanagement of the economy.
    - that's not to say it's impossible or impractical, just that it's
      a challenge
