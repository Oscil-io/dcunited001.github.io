# 2020's: trends to anticipate

- TODO: move to a draft
- possibly it's own blog post
- increased demand for smart grid in developed states
  - but also developing states, since they are either upgrading older
    gear and/or installing fresh electric grid gear

- changes to real estate (predictable) based on:
  - (1) renewables & specifics of real-estate
  - (2) potential of real-estate to be upgraded w/ smart grid tech
    - the specific rollout dynamics of such technology
  - (3) the upper bound on renewables wattage for a building
    - e.g. urban buildings have almost no capacity for wind (on top)
      and less capacity for solar, but still have capacity for
      biological-based renewables (though these often require
      sunlight/external energy)
  - (4) capacity for urban food production

# climate change

### Personal thoughts on climate change

Carbon dioxide is mostly meaningless in itself. It's a red herring and
a kind of a straw man. Pollution is the real problem, with downstream
effects on hierarchical, interdependent biological systems.

### danger of tax-funded monetization of pollution cleanup when the beneficiaries are those who caused the problems

- those who profited off the creation of these problems should not be
  the ones draining the tax coffers getting rich cleaning them up.

### Climate Change influences policy around the world

- developed states adapt first and export new tech to developing
  states (incentivized by demand for data(!) and demand for
  development of these states)
- smart grid tech provides fabric of metrics to measure
  usage/purpose and is essential for accurate assessment of carbon
  tax offsets
- states with space and capability, but no industry leverage
  carbon offsets(?)
  - with paris accord
  - therefore, island nations with large swaths of shallow/placid
    CZ(contiguous zone) and EEZ(Extended Economic Zones) can use the
    space to produce energy or generally reduce carbon for
    "production" that is essentially valuable to the world
    - if the world decides to set up such an artificial
      international institution to reflect this as a norm
- developing states begin to develop faster, which should fuel
  economic growth the world over
  - BUT WE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT AFFORD A CRASH RIGHT NOW

### The Smart Grid and the Importance of Stability in Developing Nations

  - some-thing like pulse-width shift between digital/analog
  - the AC/DC divide pushes from consumer electronics to homes, cars
    and higher order containments of DC electronics systems with
    capacity for dynamic power managment where current carries power
    AND data.
    - this shift creates trillions in demand for replacement of
      electric grid infrastructure *worldwide* gradually across three
      decades
    - the mechanics of this flux of demand rippling through the global
      economie affect industrialized nations differently than
      developing nations with less infrastructure
      - the nations with more infrastructure to replace do it more
        slowly, which creates a need to gradually shift to new
        infrastructure, requiring backwards compatability.
        - this requirement for backwards compatibility limits the
          payoffs to infrastructure updates, which could mean that
          undeveloped nations are more likely to benefit more quickly
        - in the end, we all end up with mostly the same set of
          capabilities from upgraded smart grid infrastructure, but
          less developed nations are better positioned to receive
          these benefits faster with less cost and less design
          constraints.
        - therefore, the flux of demand will tend to strongly impact
          developing nations, as they get higher payoffs for cheaper,
          as long as there is some threshold of stability.
        - therefore, if the united states can leverage its authority
          as an international power player to compel others to help
          foment stability in these nations, then we can
          simultaneously position ourselves to help supply that
          demand. The demand is a product of the expectation of
          permanent stablity in these nations.
        - therefore, the US helps provide stability and profits from
          the export of electric grid technology, while retaining the
          benefits it receives from the analytics based on smart grid
          consumption analytics and uses this data to stay ahead AND
          help promote the level of stability that makes it all
          possible.

### Carbon Tax redistributes (some) wealth, but on a fair basis

- as much as i am inherently suspicious of the idea of an artificial
  institution, whereby actions only have value if they reflect
  international norms...
  - this provides the global economy with a mechanism for liquidity
    displacement and therefore stability
    - i was thinking about this last night, the integral of liquidity
      displacement in global finance is incredibly important as a
      measure of the total displacements and movements of wealth.
      - therefore, if one wants to make money, one must observe global
        economic trends to identify/predict major liquidity movements
        and take slices of such movements (for fun AND profit)
      - i.e. every time major amounts of money exchanges hands, one
        can take a percentage of those transactions by:
        - being in the right place,
        - at the right time,
        - with the right ideas
        - and the right amount of money
    - but it's all based on strips of liquidity from major liquidity
      displacements (i.e. all based on observing the integral of the
      ~absolute~value~ of liquidity movements between major nodes in
      the graph of economic players)
      - lulz ... math

### mechanisms for economic stabalization

  - (circuits that establish *natural* balance-restoring feedback
    loops in global economic liquidity/wealth transfers)
    - THIS IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR RESPONSIBLY APPROACHING THE
      DRAMATIC TECHNOLOGY SHIFTS (i.e. SINGULARITY)
  - my point is that providing circuits in the global economy whereby
    (some) of the major liquidity redistributions can be diverted back
    into the hands of PEOPLE and to add value to people's lives is
    incredibly important for global economic stability
    - the point is not to forcibly redistribute wealth
    - the point is to architect systems whereby everyone shares wealth
      because all people, or at least ~representatives~ of people
      around the world) are essentially equivalently invested in the
      global economy
    - so, if one pictures a major liquidity displacement or value
      displacement in the global economy as a shifting of wealth from
      one group to another, then it helps if there are "circuits" that
      ensure when this happens, some of that wealth (naturally NOT
      forcibly) flows back into the hands of the people
      - or at least back into the hands of people who will trustibly
        provide value for others, so that no one is left behind
   - and the carbon tax, when implemented in the right way, provides
     an appropriate mechanism for this because adopting these values
     as international norms fuels demand for technology that moves the
     world in the right direction IMO
     - WHILE *naturally* redistributing the wealth into the hands of
       PEOPLE and NATIONS around the world
     - those who traditionally can't participate on the global
       economic stage because they lack the space or resources (or
       etc.) to fuel an industrial revolution can now participate in a
       different way that still adds value to the world
  - however, as a libertarian, i am just all-in-all distrustful of
    such artificial international institutions
    - this is partially bc such rules and such mechanisms add value
      only through mechanisms WHICH DEPEND SOLELY ON PEOPLE'S BELIEFS
      - which is what i mean by a purely artificial mechanism
      - this is not necessarily bad, but something people need to
        understand so everyone is on the same page.

- TODO: include thoughts on bill gate's idea to tax some form of
  automation
  - it's a good idea to promote economic stability in the context of
    the changed that the 21st century economy will undergo via 3D
    printing, etc.
  - however, the challenge is codifying it into law in a way that is
    fair, simple and not government micromanagement of the economy.
    - that's not to say it's impossible or impractical, just that it's
      a challenge

### carbon tax provides insights into global economic trends

- carbon tax provides insights into global economic trends, by
  leveraging the smart grid to help humanity understand how people
  consume resources, qualitatively and quantitatively
  - this is also something everyone needs to understand so we're all
    on the same page
  - this is where the money is, *BY THE WAY*
    - and i'm going to continue publicizing all that i can until
      someone helps me build something
      - because apparently i haven't demonstrated enough value to
        prove myself worthy of praise and respect and opportunity.
      - ahem, sorry, not sorry
- these metrics depend on the features and level of data, integration
  and global product penetration.
  - the higher these qualities are optimized, the greater the degree
    of value that is added to society
- it could be that the degree of value added to society by metrics
  begins to surpass the value of oil.
  - that is, the value-added by the capacity and quality of
    information exchange begins to exceed that added by oil (or
    capacity and efficiency of product exchange)

### carbon tax institution w/ some mechanisms for taxation/oversight

- another thing that makes my libertarian side a bit nervous is the
  authority that is delegated to such an international institution.
  - the international authority to measure correlates with the
    collection high-value data
    - this, amoung other things, requires a huge amount of trust
  - this institution represents the ability to transition authority
    for a means of taxation to an international institution
    - at least, to a degree never before see
    - to me, unless most properly implemented, this represents a
      threat to sovereignty not just to america, but to every nation
      on earth
      - it actually scares me a bit
  - not only is the data on resource utilization/demand dangerous, but
    so is the capacity for macro & micro economic shenanigans
    - i don't think very many on the left or right have thought about
      this issue in this way, actually
      - to many, it's a matter of right and wrong, with respect to the
        environment or the economy.
      - to me, it's incredibly more complex than that. it's a matter
        of ethical risk and sovereignty

### access to space becomes critical to a renewables economy

- at least, until humanity has access to space, capacity for energy
  production requires space. this is true, almost first and foremost.
  - i.e. if you don't have space (surface area on earth) you can't
    produce large quantities of energy
    - this is why island nations with large
      [CZ](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/gcil_maritime.html) &
      [EEZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone)
      have both:
      - (1) capacity for wind (& solar? maybe ... dependends on
        engineering specifics i.e. durability)
      - (2) capacity for carbon cleanup by reducing quantities of
        dissolved CO2 via access to large swaths of ocean.
    - and by "first and foremost" i mean that the quantity of energy a
      nation or tract of land can produce is a (multiplicative)
      *product* of *at least* the area (or volume in some cases) of
      space available
  - the economic mechanics here are *similar* to that of food
    production. to produce food, you must first *at least* have
    land. no land no food.
    - but, with renewables, now land that can't be used for food can
      at least be used for energy production. this stabalizes the
      value of land for nations that have, until recently, been
      screwed by fate of geography & resource distribution.

- therefore, access to space becomes critical in an economy which is
  increasingly driven by resource availability and price
  - to this end, nano-based waste reclaimation becomes enticing 4
    countries w/ landfills
  - whether/when space elevator tech becomes available, then this
    real-estate becomes valuable
    - this tech is dependent on carbon nano-fibers
    - the valuable land here is equatorial land, which stands in
      contrast to trend whereby arctic and antarctic land becomes
      valuable for unexploited resources (this is a bit of a side
      trek)
      - but honestly, it'd be wise to hold off as long as possible
        before tapping those resources IF EVER
        - it's kind of like robbing santa claus (but not really)
        - would you rob chris cringle? it's really not that bad
          though. however, with better technology, humanity would be
          much better equipped to tap these resources without
          interfering with the environment, which is at least one
          reason why we should wait.

### space-faring institutions establish sovereignty using transnationalism

- more on this....
- transnationalism is one of the most important concepts we can be
  feeling out right now. because it was new as hell to me (and a bit
  scary, actually!!!)
  - they need to be declared as transnational entities, politically,
    because of their massive cost structures and their need to
    flexibly reposition themselves in anticipation of unpredictable
    global economic trends

### water, irrigation and desalinization

# Misc

### fusion

- "game-ending. if you get fusion, you win the game." 'nuff said

### supply chain "dimension"

- supply chain dimension of the American & Global Economies
  - reference arguments from article on regulating conflict minerals
    trade in african nations
  - elaborate on mechanics/dynamics of shifting supply chains
    - especially in the context of novel materials/fabrication tech

# Law and Rights of Individuals in Inter/National Law

### At Birth, Every Individual has a Tabula Rasa of Legal Rights/Obligations

- Every individual has a Nearly "tabula rasa" set of rights, at birth
  - that is, there are some
- As I understand an US Citizen or Individual's rights in
- arguments from the information warfare articles:

# Trends in International Law are Gaining Momentum

- international norms => policy on AI & usages & limitations
  - analogy for cyber/infowar w/ epidemic

### International Policy for IAC & NIAC, with respect to Transnationalism

- The architects of international policy and law on human rights
  missed a spot and it's a quite concerning...
- according to Harvard ILJ and/or US Naval War College, there are
  major differences in how sections of UN/Geneva policy apply to IAC's
  & NIAC's
  - i.e. IAC/NIAC: international & non-international armed conflicts
  - the Geneva Convention and UN Charter only require adherence to
    human rights norms for IAC's
    - the implementation for the international basis of human rights
      differs in IAC's vs. NIAC's
    - NIAC's basically aren't covered (not by certain sections of the
      geneva convention & UN charter that define the legal basis of
      those norms)
- this is why the concept of transnationalism is very scary
  indeed. it's the breakdown of the westphalian paradigm, which has
  held steadfast the notions themselves of statehood
  - the westphalian paradigm is what is responsible for those lines on
    a map that define a nation. as international law is concerned now,
    the only confusion that arises over the distinction b/w nations is
    when territory of a nation is disputed b/w nations.
  - i.e. nations are defined geographically iff the westphalian
    paradigm is accepted as a norm, but if/when it begins to break
    down, then the idea itself of statehood becomes something which is
    less clearly defined
    - With the westphalian paradigm, nations are geographically bound.
      you can be a Dutch citizen standing in the Netherlands and
      you're clearly a Dutch citizen standing on Dutch soil, where
      Dutch laws apply to you (local/provincial/federal)
      - for this Dutch citizen, some international law applies as well
      - but if this man travels to the UK, then clearly, the UK's laws
        begin to apply (and in some circumstances, the man's
        home-state's laws could also restrict his rights to some
        degree, even in the UK)
- the concept of transnationalism causes the westphalian paradigm to
  begin to break down and (at least, to me) it is not very clear what
  laws apply where.
  - if you have your citizenship revoked as a US citizen, what laws
    apply to you?
    - if this is for national security purposes, then would you even
      know whether your rights as a US Citizen have become forfeit?
      - you answered "yes, of course!" didn't you
      - are you sure? are you really sure that you would know your
        rights had been restricted?
  - according to some international law scholars (with whom i'm not
    sure I agree in principle, etc.)
    - transnationalism eventually evolves into postnationalism, which
      is kind of a globalist wetdream, but may also just be where the
      world has evolved by the 22nd century (or maybe the 23rd)
    - transnationalism is an *unbelievably vague* concept that can
      have very different meanings and legal implications, depending
      on the context.
  - as the westphalian paradigm begins to lose it's grip in the minds
    of those who hold power in nations, then this vague notion of
    transnationalism begins to manifest itself as an "in between
    state" of "nation" and "non-nation"
    - it becomes less clear what a nation "is" and especially so when
      one realizes that almost every sane, well-learned person thinks
      of the United States as a "place" and not as a "legal entity"
      under the purview of some higher authority
- what provoked my exploration of this? the concepts of authority and
  legitimacy to international law/policy/institutions
  - what authority does an international institution actually hold?
    why? how can one compel such an institution to change its policies
    or their implementation, if they are claimed to be unfair?
    - there are tons of very good questions here, if you want to get
      your feet wet, with regard to international law.
    - i never expected myself to become interested in Military Law or
      Maritime Law, but I've downloaded the UN Law of the Sea treaty
      (unsigned by US) as well as the DoD's 1,200+ page review of US
      Military Law, as the DoD has interpreted it.
  - but once i dipped my toe into the waters of international law &
    transnationalism, hundreds of questions flooded into my mind.
    - suddenly, nothing was clear.

### International Regulation of Supply Chains

- There is a fantastic Harvard ILJ article on this specific issue,
  which is absolutely fascinating. In terms of novel-information
  density (i.e. the percentage of content new to me) this single
  article may have accelerated my general level of knowledge more than
  any other writing I've ever consumed.
  - that is, this single article stimulated my own imagination more
    than anything else I have ever read and did so in terms of each:
    - number/kind of specific fields covered and the quantity/quality
      of new information


- that International Supply Chain article isn't the only such
  article I've consumed in the past 3 months which has accelerated
  my acquisition of knowledge to personally unknown levels

# Transnationalism

### TransNatl: In the context of the Westphalian Paradigm

- transition from the
  [westphalian paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty)
  could end up being very messy: politically, culturally, and
  economically.
  - some of the people architecting this know it, to varying degrees
  - this takes place b/w 2015-2050
    - if approached in the right way (i.e. WITH *COMMUNICATION* and
      *TIME*) then it's probably not that bad


### UN As "root" in the network of subgraphs of power structures

- this is a perspective i'm using to feel out my own understanding of
  international law & institutions
  - UN as "root" in the network of subgraphs of power structures
    - not that it's "root" in terms of authority
      - a la linux ~~ super-user
    - but root as in uppermost in totality
- reference harvord international law journal idea about
  transnationalism and the "multi-hub" architecture of overlapping
  transnational soveriegnty (i think)
  - but, with this perspective, then authority becomes shared/tiered
    and there are overlapping degrees (& tiers) of sovereignty
    - this is already happening by the way, but there are good and bad
      ways to transition into such a state
      - i.e. it may take centuries for this to occur "naturally"
      - literally centuries

### international trade agreements

- the three T's trade agreements are an example of such an overlapping
  structure of sovereignties, but i'm just not sure that's the right
  idea
  - there may be no greater power than the power to regulate trade
    - EVERYTHING RELATES TO COMMERCE
      - and possibly descends from commerce

- 3 T's Trade agreements below the UN to establish dominance over
  trade to stifle the pheonomenon of "plurality" and complexity begot
  from plurality in series of Bilateral Trade Agreements
  - this was just an idea i was feeling out by imagining UN as "root"
    and these three tiered, overlapping degrees of sovereignty
    descending from it (relating to the harvard ILJ multi-hub paper)
    - however, i am not, in any way, saying this is the way it should
      be or even trying to put this out there (though i am, i guess)
      - i don't think we should go dissolving notions and
        implementations of sovereignty
      - like i said, these kinds of trends take centuries


### TransNatl: In the context of Trade/ISDS & Federal Law

- ISDS
  - US Code
  - TPP/TKIP
  - Saudi Law (the 9-11 bill)
    - this law was written in a VERY dubious manner
    - and passed like 97-1 !!!
    - POSSIBLE MEDIA BAIT-AND-SWITCH ... IMO
    - yeh, i'm not even !@#$'ing kidding read that bill
  - National Security Laws
  - trade & treaty agreements

### examples of multi-hub (overlapping) international agreements

- these kinds of agreements can act as subgraphs in a multi-hub
  architecture of global institutions
  - again, i'm not saying this is how it should be. i'm mostly trying
    to explore these concepts, so i can more properly conceptualize
    them

- trade: NAFTA/TPP/TTIP
  - eughh...
- regional policy agreements (environmental/industrial/etc)
- technology/IP agreements
- strategic/military
- and more, no doubt

### NAFTA/TPP Chapter 11

- how do the ISDS clauses differ? do they both cover non-state
  individuals?
  - what status do non-enemy combatants have?
    - IMO, if you don't have the rights of a citizen, you are not a
      citizen, but you should still fall under the authority of NAFTA
    - and therefore, if THE GOVERNMENT PROVABLY DEPRIVED YOU of
      opportunities by abusing law and skirting on human rights
      issues, you should be able to SUE THE FUCK OUT OF THEM IN AN
      INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION SUIT
    - particularly, if your business is owned by an individual who is
      not a citizen and was intended to be used as a launching pad for
      opportunities of which you were provably and forcibly deprived,
      you should be able to SUE THE FUCK OUT OF THE AMERICAN
      GOVERNMENT ... maybe
      - obviously, you're going to need a really good lawyer. like a
        dozen of them, which sucks, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SUBJECTED
        YOU TO PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE AND DEPRIVED YOU OF ECONOMIC
        OPPORTUNITIES
        - *so basically, your life better be a great goddamn charity
          case, because otherwise you are shit out of luck.*

# South China Sea

- china's motivations for action include expansion of geopolitical
  boundaries to fuel several decades of conflict.
  - this change with geopolitically destabalize the entire oceanic
    region! and also, china, which for most of its history, has only
    cared about china, geographically
    - that's an oversimplification, but for a very long time, conflict
      there has been contained to that region (AFAIK. i'm not a
      scholar on asiatic history)
- i can't really elaborate on this
