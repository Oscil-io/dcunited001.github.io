# [Space: Economics and Evolution of Governance Mechanisms](#space-economics-and-evolution-of-governance-mechanisms)

Eventually, value added to society by smart-grid and consumer behavior
metrics may begin to surpass the value of oil, especially in an
economy with a altered set of fundamentals. What lubricates both
capacity and efficiency of product exchange? Oil. However, in an
information economy, there are more virtual products and information
is leveraged to make purchasing decisions.

3D printing and nano create radically a different economic situation,
which isn't covered in these posts.  At first, the economic response
to commercialized space is strongly affected by proximity to resources
inbound from space and terrestrial pricing of equivalent resources.

- mention the conflict theory article.
  - identify why space may lead to a post-post-westphalian transition

### access to space becomes critical to a renewables economy

- at least, until humanity has access to space, capacity for energy
  production requires space. this is true, almost first and foremost.
  - i.e. if you don't have space (surface area on earth) you can't
    produce large quantities of energy
    - this is why island nations with large
      [CZ](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/gcil_maritime.html) &
      [EEZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone)
      have both:
      - (1) capacity for wind (& solar? maybe ... dependends on
        engineering specifics i.e. durability)
      - (2) capacity for carbon cleanup by reducing quantities of
        dissolved CO2 via access to large swaths of ocean.
    - and by "first and foremost" i mean that the quantity of energy a
      nation or tract of land can produce is a (multiplicative)
      *product* of *at least* the area (or volume in some cases) of
      space available
  - the economic mechanics here are *similar* to that of food
    production. to produce food, you must first *at least* have
    land. no land no food.
    - but, with renewables, now land that can't be used for food can
      at least be used for energy production. this stabalizes the
      value of land for nations that have, until recently, been
      screwed by fate of geography & resource distribution.

- therefore, access to space becomes critical in an economy which is
  increasingly driven by resource availability and price
  - to this end, nano-based waste reclamation becomes enticing 4
    countries w/ landfills
  - there's a procession of real-estate trends that emerge as various
    space technologies become viable
  - whether/when space elevator tech becomes available, then this
    real-estate becomes valuable
    - this tech is dependent on carbon nano-fibers
    - the valuable land here is equatorial land, which stands in
      contrast to trend whereby arctic and antarctic land becomes
      valuable for unexploited resources (this is a bit of a side
      trek)
      - but honestly, it'd be wise to hold off as long as possible
        before tapping those resources IF EVER
        - it's kind of like robbing santa claus (but not really)
        - would you rob chris cringle? it's really not that bad
          though. however, with better technology, humanity would be
          much better equipped to tap these resources without
          interfering with the environment, which is at least one
          reason why we should wait.

### Commercialized Space Travel's Influence on Large Scale Real-Estate Trends

- (from speculative history article)
- equatorial regions valuable as ideal locations for both:
  - geostationary space elevators
  - space launch locations
- and therefore, there is a gravitation towards the north/south
  poles for resources, followed by a counter-trend of gravitation
  towards the equator for both sending/receiving resources to/from
  space
- depending on the engineering specifics of space elevators, some
  equatorial regions may be more or less valuable than others
- there are also quasi-geostationary space elevators, augmented with
  basic propulsion.
  - these are easier to build because they don't require as much
    nano-tech.
    - i.e. solar sail + ion propulsion upwards, while dangling a
      space-elevator downwards, so it's always falling but always
      moving upwards.
      - combine this with a means of getting stuff 20km into the air
        and you have yourself a space elevator that doesn't need to
        overcome the tension requirements that are prohibiting us from
        obtaining one now
    - this isn't exactly a new idea, but it is likely that something
      like this will be the first kind of space elevator


### space-faring institutions establish sovereignty using transnationalism

- more on this....
- transnationalism is one of the most important concepts we can be
  feeling out right now. because it was new as hell to me (and a bit
  scary, actually!!!)
  - they need to be declared as transnational entities, politically,
    because of their massive cost structures and their need to
    flexibly reposition themselves in anticipation of unpredictable
    global economic trends



# [Trends in International Law are Gaining Momentum](#trends-in-international-law-are-gaining-momentum)

- international norms => policy on AI & usages & limitations
  - analogy for cyber/infowar w/ epidemic

### At Birth, Every Individual has a Tabula Rasa of Legal Rights/Obligations

- Every individual has a Nearly "tabula rasa" set of rights, at birth
  - that is, there are some
- As I understand an US Citizen or Individual's rights in
- arguments from the information warfare articles:

### Transnationals Should Always At Least Have Human Rights

- it seems it's possible for people to declared to have no rights,
  secretly. These people should always have some inalienable human
  rights.
  - they do: refugee rights

#### Circumvention of Genevaless NEC status via an annex-by-proxy

- here is presented a hypothetical international law framework for
  circumventing blacked-out, memory-holed status of non-enemy
  combatants through an annex-by-proxy process
  - are there more notes to this? the point to this idea was to create
    a means by which allys of the US could help NEC's in the US
    while technically not aggressing against the US
    - but without more notes, i can't remember what the rest of this
      was. ahh adderal...
  - a federated non-nation would be created internationally that would
    enable people to petition to declare some land annexed by this
    non-nation
    - this is a non-traditionally defined nation: basically a
      federation of loosely affiliated exclaves

### International Policy for IAC & NIAC, with respect to Transnationalism

- The architects of international policy and law on human rights
  missed a spot and it's a quite concerning...
- according to Harvard ILJ and/or US Naval War College, there are
  major differences in how sections of UN/Geneva policy apply to IAC's
  & NIAC's
  - i.e. IAC/NIAC: international & non-international armed conflicts
  - the Geneva Convention and UN Charter only require adherence to
    human rights norms for IAC's
    - the implementation for the international basis of human rights
      differs in IAC's vs. NIAC's
    - NIAC's basically aren't covered (not by certain sections of the
      geneva convention & UN charter that define the legal basis of
      those norms)
- this is why the concept of transnationalism is very scary
  indeed. it's the breakdown of the westphalian paradigm, which has
  held steadfast the notions themselves of statehood
  - the westphalian paradigm is what is responsible for those lines on
    a map that define a nation. as international law is concerned now,
    the only confusion that arises over the distinction b/w nations is
    when territory of a nation is disputed b/w nations.
  - i.e. nations are defined geographically iff the westphalian
    paradigm is accepted as a norm, but if/when it begins to break
    down, then the idea itself of statehood becomes something which is
    less clearly defined
    - With the westphalian paradigm, nations are geographically bound.
      you can be a Dutch citizen standing in the Netherlands and
      you're clearly a Dutch citizen standing on Dutch soil, where
      Dutch laws apply to you (local/provincial/federal)
      - for this Dutch citizen, some international law applies as well
      - but if this man travels to the UK, then clearly, the UK's laws
        begin to apply (and in some circumstances, the man's
        home-state's laws could also restrict his rights to some
        degree, even in the UK)

- the concept of transnationalism causes the westphalian paradigm to
  begin to break down. transnationalism makes it less clear how laws
  and treaty provisions apply.
  - if you have your citizenship revoked as a US citizen, what laws
    apply to you?
    - if this is for national security purposes, then would you even
      know whether your rights as a US Citizen have become forfeit?
      - you answered "yes, of course!" didn't you
      - are you sure? are you really sure that you would know your
        rights had been restricted?
  - according to some international law scholars (with whom i'm not
    sure I agree in principle, etc.)
    - transnationalism eventually evolves into postnationalism, which
      is kind of a globalist wetdream, but may also just be where the
      world has evolved by the 22nd century (or maybe the 23rd)
    - transnationalism is an *unbelievably vague* concept that can
      have very different meanings and legal implications, depending
      on the context.
  - as the westphalian paradigm begins to lose it's grip in the minds
    of those who hold power in nations, then this vague notion of
    transnationalism begins to manifest itself as an "in between
    state" of "nation" and "non-nation"
    - it becomes less clear what a nation "is" and especially so when
      one realizes that almost every sane, well-learned person thinks
      of the United States as a "place" and not as a "legal entity"
      under the purview of some higher authority
- what provoked my exploration of this? the concepts of authority and
  legitimacy to international law/policy/institutions
  - what authority does an international institution actually hold?
    why? how can one compel such an institution to change its policies
    or their implementation, if they are claimed to be unfair?
    - there are tons of very good questions here, if you want to get
      your feet wet, with regard to international law.
    - i never expected myself to become interested in Military Law or
      Maritime Law, but I've downloaded the UN Law of the Sea treaty
      (unsigned by US) as well as the DoD's 1,200+ page review of US
      Military Law, as the DoD has interpreted it.
  - but once i dipped my toe into the waters of international law &
    transnationalism, hundreds of questions flooded into my mind.
    - suddenly, nothing was clear.

### International Regulation of Supply Chains

- There is a fantastic Harvard ILJ article on this specific issue,
  which is absolutely fascinating. In terms of novel-information
  density (i.e. the percentage of content new to me) this single
  article may have accelerated my general level of knowledge more than
  any other writing I've ever consumed.
  - that is, this single article stimulated my own imagination more
    than anything else I have ever read and did so in terms of each:
    - number/kind of specific fields covered and the quantity/quality
      of new information
  - that International Supply Chain article isn't the only such
    article I've consumed in the past 3 months which has accelerated
    my acquisition of knowledge to personally unknown levels.
- TODO: what about it?
  - how is it difficult? how does international supply chain
    regulation affect cost structures and the incentivization of
    corporate behavior?

# Transnationalism

### TransNatl: In the context of the Westphalian Paradigm

- transition from the
  [westphalian paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty)
  could end up being very messy: politically, culturally, and
  economically.
  - some of the people architecting this know it, to varying degrees
  - this takes place b/w 2015-2050
    - if approached in the right way (i.e. WITH *COMMUNICATION* and
      *TIME*) then it's probably not that bad


### UN As "root" in the network of subgraphs of power structures

- this is a perspective i'm using to feel out my own understanding of
  international law & institutions
  - UN as "root" in the network of subgraphs of power structures
    - not that it's "root" in terms of authority
      - a la linux ~~ super-user
    - but root as in uppermost in totality
- reference harvord international law journal idea about
  transnationalism and the "multi-hub" architecture of overlapping
  transnational soveriegnty (i think)
  - but, with this perspective, then authority becomes shared/tiered
    and there are overlapping degrees (& tiers) of sovereignty
    - this is already happening by the way, but there are good and bad
      ways to transition into such a state
      - i.e. it may take centuries for this to occur "naturally"
      - literally centuries

### international trade agreements

- the three T's trade agreements are an example of such an overlapping
  structure of sovereignties, but i'm just not sure that's the right
  idea
  - there may be no greater power than the power to regulate trade
    - EVERYTHING RELATES TO COMMERCE
      - and possibly descends from commerce

- 3 T's Trade agreements below the UN to establish dominance over
  trade to stifle the pheonomenon of "plurality" and complexity begot
  from plurality in series of Bilateral Trade Agreements
  - this was just an idea i was feeling out by imagining UN as "root"
    and these three tiered, overlapping degrees of sovereignty
    descending from it (relating to the harvard ILJ multi-hub paper)
    - however, i am not, in any way, saying this is the way it should
      be or even trying to put this out there (though i am, i guess)
      - i don't think we should go dissolving notions and
        implementations of sovereignty
      - like i said, these kinds of trends take centuries

- complexity of bilateral trade agreements leading to a "deadlock" in
  ISDS settlements and reduced flexibility in policy.
  - this leads to a situation similar to early 20th century Europe,
    where secret agreements between nations led to poorly informed
    policy decisions
  - ISDS is complex and leads to a degridation of sovereignty by
    locking out legislature-directed policy in lieu of policy directed
    by interests of foreign investors and multinations

### TransNatl: In the context of Trade/ISDS & Federal Law

- ISDS
  - US Code
  - TPP/TKIP
  - Saudi Law (the 9-11 bill)
    - this law was written in a VERY dubious manner
    - and passed like 97-1 !!!
    - POSSIBLE MEDIA BAIT-AND-SWITCH ... IMO
    - yeh, i'm not even !@#$'ing kidding read that bill
  - National Security Laws
  - trade & treaty agreements

### examples of multi-hub (overlapping) international agreements

- these kinds of agreements can act as subgraphs in a multi-hub
  architecture of global institutions
  - again, i'm not saying this is how it should be. i'm mostly trying
    to explore these concepts, so i can more properly conceptualize
    them

- trade: NAFTA/TPP/TTIP
  - eughh...
- regional policy agreements (environmental/industrial/etc)
- technology/IP agreements
- strategic/military
- and more, no doubt

### NAFTA/TPP Chapter 11

- how do the ISDS clauses differ? do they both cover non-state
  individuals?
  - what status do non-enemy combatants have?
    - IMO, if you don't have the rights of a citizen, you are not a
      citizen, but you should still fall under the authority of NAFTA
    - and therefore, if THE GOVERNMENT PROVABLY DEPRIVED YOU of
      opportunities by abusing law and skirting on human rights
      issues, you should be able to SUE THE FUCK OUT OF THEM IN AN
      INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION SUIT
    - particularly, if your business is owned by an individual who is
      not a citizen and was intended to be used as a launching pad for
      opportunities of which you were provably and forcibly deprived,
      you should be able to SUE THE FUCK OUT OF THE AMERICAN
      GOVERNMENT ... maybe
      - obviously, you're going to need a really good lawyer. like a
        dozen of them, which sucks, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SUBJECTED
        YOU TO PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE AND DEPRIVED YOU OF ECONOMIC
        OPPORTUNITIES
        - *so basically, your life better be a great goddamn charity
          case, because otherwise you are shit out of luck.*

# Global Geopolitical Analysis

### South China Sea

- china's motivations for action include expansion of geopolitical
  boundaries to fuel several decades of conflict.
  - this change with geopolitically destabalize the entire oceanic
    region! and also, china, which for most of its history, has only
    cared about china, geographically
    - that's an oversimplification, but for a very long time, conflict
      there has been contained to that region (AFAIK. i'm not a
      scholar on asiatic history)
- i can't really elaborate on this

### Russia/Ukraine

- reference articles on russia

### Middle East

### Balancing It Out

Because opportunities are not being so stagnated in South America and
Africa, we should be establishing strong ties in these places. China
is. We can't let China outpace our diplomacy in Africa because Africa,
as made obvious above, is a major source large-scale demand for
investment and infrastructure products. Therefore, Africa is going to
increase sharply in significance from 2020 through 2050, economically
and politically. Africa is going to remember who helps them out
through this time when they start investing in infrastructure like
never before.

India is also incredibly important in the global economy because they
are a nation of one billion powering itself through an industrial
transformation. The dynamics of this transformation differ greatly
from that of China's industrial transformation because India can
supply both ends of the supply/demand equation and is much more likely
to be able to help themselves through this. China fueled it's decade
long stint of double digit GDP growth with American consumerism and
American debt. India doesn't need to do that, but needs access to
Asian markets through the South Sea. This global shift in the economy
is going to make Singapore much more relevant, although the benefits
of this may fall moreso to China if they pull off this South Sea
bullshit.

# Misc

### Universal Real ID Measures Render Cover Identities Nearly Impossible

- once countries stabalize systems like Real-ID, this manufactuing
  cover identities that other countries can't validate nearly
  impossible
  - further, social media data can be sifted to identify false
    identities because every forged identity will have an inconsistent
    level or quality of data associated with it
  - it becomes very difficult to create this data without your
    opponents being able to identify possible spies
    - which is why sociocultural pushes for people to restrict usage
      of social media has been important thus far.
      - enough low-data social media accounts increases implicit cover
        for actual spies

### fusion

- "game-ending. if you get fusion, you win the game." 'nuff said

### supply chain "dimension"

- supply chain dimension of the American & Global Economies
  - reference arguments from article on regulating conflict minerals
    trade in african nations
  - elaborate on mechanics/dynamics of shifting supply chains
    - especially in the context of novel materials/fabrication tech

- structure of entities/costs/markets in the medical industry
  - in context of research, change in regulation to facilitate faster
    research and faster time-to-market
  - in the context of miracle treatments, turning formerly untreatable
    illnesses into trivially treated ones. Or rendering prohibitively
    expensive treatments into worthlessly broken profit machines.
  - it makes a big difference on the size of health care in proportion
    to other units in the American and global economies.
- the tale of asclepius, who almost cured every disease and was thus
  struck down my zeus, who feared the immortality of man.
  - people have been aware of the problems inherent in the economics
    of medicine for a long, long time.

- TODO: include thoughts on bill gate's idea to tax some form of
  automation
  - it's a good idea to promote economic stability in the context of
    the changed that the 21st century economy will undergo via 3D
    printing, etc.
  - however, the challenge is codifying it into law in a way that is
    fair, simple and not government micromanagement of the economy.
    - that's not to say it's impossible or impractical, just that it's
      a challenge


# Universal Basic Income

> I'm not trying to win a popularity contest here.

UBI is attractive because it appears to meet certain inevitable needs.
Automation will eventually create sky-high unemployment rates, thereby
triggering social unrest. However, the second and third order effects
of UBI's implementation are catastrophic, so it is incredibly unwise
to assume UBI to be an inevitable economic development. It is not the
need for UBI that is exigent, but the need to handle unavoidably high
rates of unemployment.


Why do you hear so much from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs about UBI?
Because they recognize the effects their products will unavoidably
have on labor markets and are wise enough to position themselves in
anticipation. Computational complexity of specific problems determines
the degree to which automation affects the economy, as well as this
trend's timing, pacing and completeness. Additionally, the
availability and applicability of quantum computing causes a second
major wave in the trend of automation.

### The Employer of Last Resort

The correct answer is an option for universal service. That is, the
government becomes the employer of last resort. This solution avoids
product-classification, artificial regulation of markets, the
complexity of dual currency and all the resulting economic distortion.

...


### Product Classifications and Restriction of UBI Expenditures

UBI turns into a big-government nightmare. It just doesn't work
without classifying products as approved or restricted for UBI
purchases. It also requires infrastructure for monitoring purchases
and reprimanding abuses of UBI income. Without restricting UBI
expenditures, there will be individuals and groups who will siphon
away the liquidity.

...

### The Lobbyists Win

What results? A massive incentive for government lobbying to
reclassify products.

### Regulation and the Vulnerability of Democracy to Subversion

- regulatory frameworks can be manipulated via suggestion or outright
  subversion, amplifying inefficiencies in tightly regulated markets
- this leads to a less competitive domestic economy, compared to other
  players in the global economy.
  - manipulating regulatory rules and the institutions that create
    them is a weapon in economic warfare. this weapon becomes more
    powerful as the degree of amplification that second and third
    order effects via regulatory rules have on markets.
  - additionally, the number of regulatory rules needed in a UBI
    system grows as the system evolves.

### Pseudo-Barter Systems

Because the range of products that can be purchased with UBI is vastly
greater than with food stamps, an incentive for virtualize bartering
emerges, where one trades approved products for unapproved products.

### UBI, as it is implemented, is like a Dual Currency

The system of product classifications essentially creates
an economic system with two currencies. Instead of a simple dollar
*for all debts, public and private*,

# UBI is Catastrophic to Capitalism

Capitalism essentially harnesses the same math behind machine learning
to create evolutionary dynamics. These "reified maths" form the
invisible hand that confers advantage to the best marketed, best
formulated or best packaged products. Free market systems reduce
inefficiencies in an economy, delivering more value to citizens
domestically and making the economy more competitive globally.

A poor implementation of UBI will trigger a collapse of capitalism.
Captilism isn't capitalism at all when an authority artificially and
severely restricts choice. This places enormous power in the hands of
regulators in Washington and the lobbyists who court them. The
regulators decide who wins and who loses in a market and they are
inept at doing so. The scale of inefficiency increases which causes an
aggregate increase in prices across all types of products, since any
product on the economy has a list of component products. So, price
increases are higher for the consumer because those products are
higher up the food chain, so to speak.

This dynamic creates a feedback loop between the mechanisms for
estimating the amount of UBI required and the amplification that UBI
regulation has on both product prices and market efficiency.



### How Automation Affects the Labor Markets

The perceived and actual ROI of employment roles depends on the degree
to which each role's tasks can be automated. For roles involving a
more complicated arrangement of tasks, the ability to completely
automate that role is inherently diminished. The structuring of roles
to task types changes as the labor markets evolve. Generally, if an
employment role involves a simpler set of task types, that role can be
automated away more quickly. If the set of task types is more complex,
there is a greater need for General AI (AGI). For each task type, the
complexity of the solutions nearly completely determines its potential
to be automated.

- 

It's a common assumption, but mental labor is not safe. In fact, these
are some of the easiest and most effective roles to automate. For
roles involving mental labor, a trend will be to automate stages in
the role's decision making process, exposing vital data points in a
user interface. From there it's mostly thumbs up or thumbs down: the
employee in the mental labor role makes decisions as data is presented
to them. This essentially harnesses as
[dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction),
which is required for mitigating computational complexity in machine
learning.

With respect to dimensionality reduction, the curse of dimensionality
is not kind to humanity in the age of automation, where it before
allowed us to solve problems which would otherwise be intractible. For
almost any task type, if the most complete analytical solution is
intractible, there is almost certainly an efficient formulation
involving clustering and dimensionality reduction. This forms the
basis of a tractible analytical approximation to the original
solution.

Of course, there is no actual connection between the two. But without
needing to understanding the connection, a computer can identify
seemingly uncorrelated variables which can be use to construct an
approximate solution. The more data, the more accurately its
construction of approximated solutions can be leveraged.

What that common assumption fails to grasp is the computational
capacity of the human brain, which still outpaces the sum of
computational capacity from all supercomputers on Earth. While user
interface for the human brain is weak and requires years of
conditioning, someone in a mental labor is essentially performing many
of the same tasks that computers would. The human brain is
particularly good at identifying and correlating arbitrary data, which
provide data-processing shortcuts to some solution.

A task type that forms a major dependency of AI-driven businesses is
in the data itself: data science, data processing infrastructure and
user interface. In this way, task types like these will be needed at
ever-increasing rates, but eventually, software, data-science and
infrastructure can all be automated. If someone lacks the equivalent
of a master's degree in either math or a field where math is strongly
applied, they are unlikely to be useful for data-science.
