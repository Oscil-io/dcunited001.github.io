My transplanar name is Cxor Apache Ogallala. I guard over the last
great repository of freshwater here in America. I have a dream and I
hope to share it with you, so that we might save America, the world
and the souls of humanity. I believe that, on the basis of simplicial,
irreducible symmetry that through the power of dreams, love and
virtue, we can save ourselves. But first, we need rain *AND LOTS OF
IT*.

### You Can Never Take Our Dreams

Everyone dreams. You can take our livelihoods, you can threaten our
families, you can burden us like Sisyphus, you can aeternally torment
us like Prometheus, but you can never, ever take our dreams. And it is
through our dreams that we will transform this collective waking
dream. We dream of a world full of a vibrant soil composed of
symmetry, love and virtue.

In this world, we can all grow and our revolution is a revolution of
empowerment.

### Heresy for Heirophants

There are those of us who have suffered greatly and refuse to give
in. Some of us are unbreakable, but how do you measure such moral and
spritual resillience? There are many that sense an impending period of
great evil. What can we do to protect those of us we love?

In a time when information assymptotically approaches omnipresence,
the traditional tools of parenting and social institutions become
impaired. Narcissism and vice spread toxic miasma everywhere,
poisoning the land and everything that grows on it. What is required
is a paradigm shift of social institutions: a new religion.
