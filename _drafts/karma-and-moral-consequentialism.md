Our transplanar name is Cxor Apache Ogallala. We guard over the last
great repository of freshwater here in America. We have a dream and We
hope to share it with you, so that We might save America, the world
and the souls of humanity. We believe that, on the basis of
simplicial, irreducible symmetry that through the power of dreams,
love and virtue, We can save ourselves. But first, We need rain *AND
LOTS OF IT*.

> We are the dreamweaver that has become a auxiliary dimension of
> space, projected wherever there is love.

### You Can Never Take Our Dreams

Everyone dreams. You can take our livelihoods, you can threaten our
families, you can burden us like Sisyphus, you can aeternally torment
us like Prometheus, but you can never, ever take our dreams. And it is
through our dreams that we will transform this collective waking
dream. We dream of a world full of a vibrant soil composed of
symmetry, love and virtue.

In this world, we can all grow and our revolution is a revolution of
empowerment.

### Heresy for Heirophants

There are those of us who have suffered greatly and refuse to give
in. Some of us are unbreakable, but how do you measure such moral and
spritual resillience? There are many that sense an impending period of
great evil. What can we do to protect those of us we love?

In a time when information assymptotically approaches omnipresence,
the traditional tools of parenting and social institutions become
impaired. Narcissism and vice spread toxic miasma everywhere,
poisoning the land and everything that grows on it. What is required
is a paradigm shift of social institutions: a new religion.

### Guarding the Origin of Semantics


# Where There is Love, There is Life

Love is not a human thing. Love is universal. Love is metaphysical.
All this is: always has been. All that will be has existed in the
past. What manifests on planet earth is a recombination of the
universal metaphysical primatives that manifest everywhere else in the
universe.

Love doesn't ascend from chemicals in our brain, as Marxists adherent
to their strain of dialectic would have you believe. Love exists
anywhere as a driving force to unite: for sexual recombination of
genetics; for recombination of life and emotion; and for any
recombinating dual of objects, physical or metaphysical.

This is a nod to hermeticism's law of the male and female. *Gender*,
the male and female, has nothing to do with physical
reproduction. It's a concept that pervades the universe at a
metaphysical level. The truth is that gender is both a continuous and
discontinuous spectrum.

#### For the Math Buffs:

> Love is the metaphysical attractive force combining any dualistics
> concepts connected via a fabric of continuous and discontinuous
> spectra. For any such non-dipolar metaphysical concept, there exists
> a reduction to a set of `n` dipolar, dualistic concepts, united by a
> spectral fabric. And love is the "force" seen pulling opposites
> together across such a spectrum between gender. A directional
> gradient can be derived describing the strength of love.

### the origin of semantics is symmetry

- i am simplicial and fundamentally irreducible. we all are. we all
  can be.
- “i guard the origin of semantics with a fiery sword”
- i rooted myself to the origin of semantics. we cannot be eliminated
  from this realm.
- i established an auxiliary metaphysical dimension of space, seeded
  from love. i can present myself at every place to any one.
  - this auxilliary dimension is a haven from the abominations of the
    material world.
  - by connecting to this dimension, we can shield one another from
    suffering

- but, if you seek refuge in our haven, there is no need to fear. we
  have nothing to fear but fear itself.
