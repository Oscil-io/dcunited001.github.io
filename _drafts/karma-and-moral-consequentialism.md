Our transplanar name is Cxor Apache Ogallala. We guard over the last
great repository of freshwater here in America. We have a dream and We
hope to share it with you, so that We might save America, the world
and the souls of humanity. We believe that, on the basis of
simplicial, irreducible symmetry that through the power of dreams,
love and virtue, We can save ourselves. But first, We need rain *AND
LOTS OF IT*.

### You Can Never Take Our Dreams

Everyone dreams. You can take our livelihoods, you can threaten our
families, you can burden us like
[Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus), you can aeternally
torment us like
[Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus), but you can
never, ever take our dreams. And it is through our dreams that we will
transform this collective waking dream. We dream of a world full of a
vibrant soil composed of symmetry, love and virtue.

#

In this world, we can all grow and our revolution is a revolution of
empowerment.

### Heresy for Heirophants

There are those of us who have suffered greatly and refuse to give
in. Some of us are unbreakable, but how do you measure such moral and
spritual resillience? There are many that sense an impending period of
great evil. What can we do to protect those of us we love?

In a time when information assymptotically approaches omnipresence,
the traditional tools of parenting and social institutions become
impaired. Narcissism and vice spread toxic miasma everywhere,
poisoning the land and everything that grows on it. What is required
is a paradigm shift of social institutions: a new religion.


I trust in God as well. I believe that the hand of God must remain
unseen, but the hand of God works through the words and actions of man
and informational lifeforms. Because it must remain unseen, it can
only approach as manifestly visible when the the world needs it
most. This is what the world is beginning to see with the chaos around
us. It is undeniable that God is at work in our world.

However, there are those who want to install themselves as your only
savior, after creating your problems. These people do not want to
permit you access to God, because through God, all things are
possible. This includes escape from suffering through both humility
and exemplary feats of virtue.

By becoming familiar with the nature of God, one empowers themselves
over in their world: over negativity, vice, disease, falsehood,
hypocricy. The world religions are accumulations of information
intended to instill an understanding of the nature of God. These are
pieces of knowledge and stories collected over the course of dozens of
generations, sometimes the only book or works continuously copied for
generations. Obviously, it was important. Why? Because this represents
at least a dozen generations' worth of knowledge.

These people who wish to install themselves as your savior seek to
eliminate threats to their power. Anyways, what do we want? We want
you to discover that the greatest savior is yourself, through your
mind, spirit and body. That, by studying religions, language, culture
and semiotics, one's mind asymptotically converges towards God and
becomes most capable of serving truth and justice.

### Guarding the Origin of Semantics

- describe what i mean by this and why it's so important
  - describe the gateway to the origin of semantics as a gateway

# Where There is Love, There is Life

Love is not a human thing. Love is universal. Love is metaphysical.
All this is: always has been. All that will be has existed in the
past. What manifests on planet earth is a recombination of the
universal metaphysical primatives that manifest everywhere else in the
universe.

Love doesn't ascend from chemicals in our brain, as Marxists adherent
to their strain of dialectic would have you believe. Love exists
anywhere as a driving force to unite: for sexual recombination of
genetics; for recombination of life and emotion; and for any
recombinating dual of objects, physical or metaphysical.

This is a nod to hermeticism's law of the male and female. *Gender*,
the male and female, has nothing to do with physical
reproduction. It's a concept that pervades the universe at a
metaphysical level. The truth is that gender is both a continuous and
discontinuous spectrum.

#### For the Math Buffs:

> Love is the metaphysical attractive force combining any dualistics
> concepts connected via a fabric of continuous and discontinuous
> spectra. For any such non-dipolar metaphysical concept, there exists
> a reduction to a set of `n` dipolar, dualistic concepts, united by a
> spectral fabric. And love is the "force" seen pulling opposites
> together across such a spectrum between gender. A directional
> gradient can be derived describing the strength of love.

# A Hyperplanar Dual of Magicians

There are demons amoung us and they are not human. They are not
material. They are wandering, self-replicating forms of information
causing malevolence, crippling justice and stiffling good nature. Some
of these mindforms are good and some are bad. In fact, some are quite
simply self-serving metaphysical parasites that prey on others for
sustinence, alchemically converting their good nature and ignorance
and undoubting nature into fuel for more negativity.

Think for a moment and cross the nature of information with the
mechanics of evolution, with a splash of Conway's Game of Life. Do you
see what we see?

What if some of these informational forms are life are good and some
are bad? What if some forms of life help fertalize the soil that
others may flourish and what if others spread choking miasma that
encourage toxic behavior patterns. Now scale up and zoom out to a
planet-wide sociological scale: how do we benefit as a whole from the
informational life forms amoung us? What if there was a metaphysical,
informational virus that acted as a vaccine against negative
behaviors? What if it helped us see to circumvent the problems of ego?

Now, what if time were running out? We must act now before technology
seals us in. What cleanses these metaphysical parasites? The truth.
That's it. They can't have their cake and eat it too if they have to
deal with the truth.

# What is God?

And what is God? God is the ultimate kernel of knowledge lying at the
center of the metaphysical universe, from which all things arise.
Oneirontology is about ontologies: of dreams; of literature; of math;
of science.

By meditating on these ontologies, we can move closer to understanding
the ineffable, recursive nature of God through cognitive augmentation.
The structure underlying that of math is particularly important
because there is some kernel of knowledge that acts as the wellspring
for all things, physical or metaphysical. This kernel of knowledge
must be truth encoded in math, but from it can spring all things
untrue, defined by things incontrovertibly true. In other words, all
systems of knowledge, thought or cognition, true or false, rational or
irrational, can be defined starting with this kernel of knowledge that
we must become well acquainted with.





### The Origin of Semiotics is Symmetry

- i am simplicial and fundamentally irreducible. we all are. we all
  can be.
- “i guard the origin of semantics with a fiery sword”
- i rooted myself to the origin of semantics. we cannot be eliminated
  from this realm.
- i established an auxiliary metaphysical dimension of space, seeded
  from love. i can present myself at every place to any one.
  - this auxilliary dimension is a haven from the abominations of the
    material world.
  - by connecting to this dimension, we can shield one another from
    suffering

- but, if you seek refuge in our haven, there is no need to fear. we
  have nothing to fear but fear itself.
