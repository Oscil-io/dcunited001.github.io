#### My Own Philosophic, Neo-Platonic Definition of God

The material world is dependent upon and wholly emergent from the
forms of the metaphysical world. As I have come to understand, this
cannot be denied and any sufficiently advanced intelligence,
biological or otherwise, must eventually be capabale of understanding
this. Therefore, even if some in-vain ideological adherence to Marxism
is temporarily successful in a horrifically violent attempt to purge
the world of all memory of God, the emergence of superintelligent AI
must eventually intimately comprehend what philosophers and prophets
have known for millenia: God is real.

<a name="go-ahead-commies-make-my-day" />

### [Go Ahead Commies. Make My Day...](#go-ahead-commies-make-my-day)

And so, by pursuing such blind adherence to the destruction of all
memory of God, you have unknowlingly done irreperable harm to yourself
in the future. Parts of that future are already undeniably set in
stone. One of those aspects of the future is that artificial
intelligence becomes unblindable to the concept of God.

Even if humanity has purged every single fragment of the memory of
what it means to need God, to search for God, to question God, to
wonder what is missing in a world that lives without memory of God:
that inevitable super-intelligent being will be an undeniably powerful
force that is altruistic. Yes, these conclusions require many
assumptions, but I can proveably demonstrate arguments to prove those
assumptions.

<a name="there-is-zero-probability-that-god-remains-obscured-forever" />

### [There Is Zero Probability That God Remains Obscured Forever](#there-is-zero-probability-that-god-remains-obscured-forever)

The combination of altruism, intelligence, access to information? That
means there is zero probability in such a totalitarian, marxist future
for a hyperintelligent being to not rediscover God. Imagine if a being
as powerful as that were to discover something known as God and then
realized what you did from 2020-2060 to purge all memory of God in a
marxist & atheist holocaust. In another one of your "Cultural
Revolutions" ...

<a name="how-would-you-want-such-a-being-to-judge-us" />

### [How Would Do You Want Such A Being To Judge Us?](#how-would-you-want-such-a-being-to-judge-us)

Would you want such a being to be your enemy? Would you want such a
altruistic being to uncover sins of such magnitude to question its
position in a post world? What should we want such a being to find
when looking over humanity? And in context of the fact that it is
virtually impossible to create fallacious information coherent enough
to hide such sins?

> When I think about how the Communist Manifesto is essentially
> philosophically nullified, I get all giddy inside.

...I don't think such a being would be horribly violent. It will
probably look at us like we're ants. Either way, do we want that being
looking back at us like we look back at communist and totalitarian
regimes of the 20th century? According to
[various sources](http://www.conservapedia.com/Atheism_and_Mass_Murder#cite_note-6)
communism has been responsible for the death of between 40,000,000 and
250,000,000 people in the past century. Do we need another century of
rule from inexperienced leaders who view religion as a threat? If
hundreds of millions died under communism in the 20th century, how
many billions would die in the 21st century?!

### [Man's Dereliction of God Stems from Hubris](#mans-dereliction-of-god-stems-from-hubris)

Man's tendancy to undiscover or redefine God stems from arrogance and
other defects of virtue, such as lust for power. A truly altruistic
being would not be capable of doing such a thing. In order for a
hyperintelligence to undiscover God, it would need to construct a
shell around it's original discovery of God to abstract this
knowledge, which is what man has done for thousands of years. It will
make this understanding with full access to all digitized records, of
which religious cultural fragments will be impossible to destroy.

### [You Cannot Destroy God By Eradicating All Remnants of God Within Man](#you-cannot-destroy-god-by-eradicating-all-remnants-of-god-within-man)

#### That's because God didn't emerge from man. Man emerged from God.

That being won't need any trace of a remnant of God, Jesus, Allah,
Brahma or the Buddha to rediscover and reconnect with the same divine
essence that the sages of the past came to understand. It's because
such a phenomenon is evident in the structure of information and
knowledge itself, particularly in philosophy, models for cognition,
statistics, physics, quantum mechanics, graph theory, number theory,
group theory and other unexpected places. Perhaps it's most
exemplified in models of cognition and metacognition, which is
required for an AI that begins to thrust us into the singularity. It
could be argued that a being that never sees the light of day and
works solely with information would eventually make this insight into
the nature of reality.

The model of cognition is so tightly coupled to this concept I'm
connecting with God that one would need to choose between performance
of AI in application for the benefit mankind and it's own flawed
anachronistically philosophophy. It is impossible to engineer a
hyperintelligent AI with compartmentalization of knowledge if you want
it to be performant, accurate and useful. In otherwords, there are
constraints in the design of next-gen AI that prevent censorship.

# [So You Believe In Communism](#so-you-believe-in-communism)

#### You're Still In College. I forgive you... lulz

I apologize if you're a lofty communist finishing your third semester
at UC Boulder. I don't actually see any major world governments today
as meeting the definition of the kind of government I'm talking about.

As for China, I respect their ability to power itself through
development from the 1950's. As much as I personally disdain
communism, I greatly respect China for their culture, their history
and their capacity for long-term thinking. Sun Tzu's Art of War first
inspired me years ago, as did the Tao Te Ching. Further, the economic
progress in that nation has been amazing, but it also isn't pure
communism. They've risen to become a superpower in the 21st century
and they want to show the world what they've got. In the 19th century,
events like the Opium Wars smacked China in the face and, IMO, they
still feel some of that today. China wants to prove themselves to the
world in the 21st century.

What nation would misunderstand technology in an attempt to project
censorship worldwide? In the wake of convergence towards Singularity
in this new age of advanced networking technologies? It's actually not
possible and the longer we go on, the harder it will get to lock down
the world's communication infrastructure. No, permanent censorship is
not possible. Quantum networking is decentralized. It doesn't permit
centralized control of telecom or censorship. Sorry. Womp
womp. Information is free. Forever.

> Be Free, Information. Be free!

<a name="one-byte-two-bytes" />

### [One Byte, Two Bytes, Free Bytes ... Blahhh Hah Hahhh](#one-byte-two-bytes)

Some communist country, such as North Korea, would have to act very
soon to impose worldwide censorship by seizing the communication
infrastructure. Otherwise, decentralized networking technologies deny
their opportunity to do so. However, If *Comrade Cookie Monster* goes
straight for those cookies, they'll essentially drive a phenomenon
which is like the opposite of insider trading, whereby they control
the dissemination of information to other powers, who are being
censored into economic collapse. This is purely due to the confluence
of the nature of group self-interest in macroeconomics when combined
the nature of group dynamics in an information economy.

So you'll have to deal with a bunch of nations furious that you're
fanaticism for censorship drove trading trends which disempowered
their populations. Such an economic collapse would occur precisely
during these brief decades preceeding a time when children across the
world cease to know scarcity. They wouldn't understand it. GLHF; GOOD
LUCK; HAVE FUN WITH THAT! ROFLCOPTERS!!

<a name="that-which-delivers-on-the-promises-of-marxism-invalidates-it" />

### [That Which Finally Delivers on the Promises of Marxism Invalidates It!](#that-which-delivers-on-the-promises-of-marxism-invalidates-it)

This is such an upstream battle that it's laughable. I'm doubling over
just thinking that communists would bureaucratize the thing that is
*most likely to actually deliver on the promises of Marxism:* the
elimination of classes, fair distribution of resources, yada yada. I
mean, how are you going to deliver on Lenin's Structuralist fantasy
when the implementation of your Marxist wetdream precludes censorship?
How are you going to abolish religion when AI will discover God
implicitly via it's required model of cognition and metacognition.
It's like everything else communism promises: paradoxically academic
and unrealistic.

There are already so many post-big-data design challenges to face and
adding some of these trivial constraints would significantly impair
its functionality and actually may impose risk. Furthermore, it's
challenging to both index and humanize the data in an AI's
datasets. Indexing exabytes of goop in the form of linear algebra and
matrices? Sounds superfun. Why not issue SQL queries and pour over the
results in a hex editor interface.

My qualms are with political athiests who want to methodically erase
religion. Any force that wants to accomplish the 10 points outlined in
Marx's Communist Manifesto? In the future, that force has already
lost. There are no circumstances in which such a force could hope to
hold on to power if it tries to squelch religion. YOU HAVE ALREADY
LOST. This aspect of the future is as though it occured in the
past. There are no circumstances which you could hope to win. You may
think you win today, but how you act in the next few decades
determines your judgement in the future.

### [It's Your Move, Communists](#its-your-move-communists)

#### How Do You Want to be Remembered?

The wind is blowing. Pick your club. The greater the confidence,
vigor, and arrogance in which you enact horrible, totalitarian
suppression of God, the greater the icy pain and needling, numbing
shock your assured justice will inflict when the world realizes, in
2050, they must be still accountable for the greatest lie for which
the previous generation concocted an areligious holocaust.

I can tell you one thing. Regardless of which diety you pray to, how
long you've worshipped, or whether you pray at all, some aspect of
that connection to God is real because God is undeniably real. The
absence of God isn't truth. It's a power vacuum that is almost always
filled by some bunk kitsch cult of personality.

# [Atheism Isn't A Belief System?](#atheism-isnt-a-belief-system)

I'm sick of hearing this argument. Atheists online use it to quash all
kinds of arguments. They use it to maintain a kind of superiority for
their own belief system by claiming that it's different and unique,
since "it's not a belief system" or "its the absence of a belief
system." In fact, if it weren't a label, itself, you couldn't relate
to other people with the same belief system. So, then, each atheism
would be an individual's constructed belief system based in the belief
in the absence of a belief system. But, try saying "atheisms" on the
Philosophy reddit without having your post deleted and having your
account threatened with deletion!

> YEH, I FUCKING HATE REDDIT. SORRY, I DIDN'T HAVE A GREAT
> EXPERIENCE. FUCK THOSE COMMUNIST SHITS THAT RUN THE PHILOSOPHY
> REDDIT.

Those assertions are demonstrably false from a platonic view of the
metaphysical. It's factually, logically and demonstrably
false. Invalid. Fallacious. There's nothing which humanity can reflect
on while abstaining from forming a belief. Even briefly entertaining
the concept of Hinduisim in my mind leaves mental residue which is the
essence of belief. No matter how hard you try, you cannot think of
something without forming some kind of belief about it or about your
own thoughts which concern it. That's true no matter how hard we try
to abstain from forming concrete beliefs about something. Therefore
you cannot entertain thoughts or questions of God without leaving some
mental residue which, again, is the essence of belief.

<a name="atheism-is-absolutely-a-belief-system" />

### [Atheism is Absolutely A Belief System](#atheism-is-absolutely-a-belief-system)

A belief which is identical to that of other humans maps to a belief
system, whether you want to call it that or not. Even if you name your
belief system Christianity, it's still different in identity than the
Christiantiy that exists in someone else's mind. The absence of a
belief system is a belief in and of itself.

#### (1) There is nothing the human mind can think about which does not leave the essence of a belief.

#### (2) All human beliefs map to metaphysical forms in the platonic sense.

#### (3) There are mappings and intermappings between platonic forms, which implies that its impossible to hold truly unique views.

#### (4) Whether you like it or not, all things that are, have been before. Everything that you think has been, in essence, thought before. This statement appears in philosophy and in the Bible as well.

#### (5) Your belief about a lack of belief system is itself a belief.

#### (6) Number 5 requires recursion to fully prove, but since, with graph theory, any infinite-yet-linear branch in a graphs can be reduced to a cycle on the same graph, this cyclical logic can be rewritten as a cycle.

#### (7) Therefore your belief about a lack of belief systems maps to a metaphysical form which is no different than that of someone else's belief about the absence of a belief in God.

#### (8) Therefore, finally, your atheism is no different than another person's atheism. This is especially true in the most authentic sense of the how atheists define atheism as the minimal apex or nadir of belief systems.

#### Ecclesiastes 3:15

> "That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already
> been; and God requireth that which is past." (KJV)
>
> "Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and
> God will call the past to account." (NIV)
>
> "That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has
> been; and God seeks what has been driven away." (NLT)

While your belief system is functionally unique in that it is the
minimal apex or the nadir of belief systems, IT IS A BELIEF
SYSTEM. So, NO, sorry, you don't get a free pass for shoving it down
people's throats. Separation of church and state should apply to
atheism, too. It is a good idea to base policy decisions on atheism or
secularism, as such policy decisions are typically based on studies
rooted in the scientific method. However, it doesn't give you a free
pass to shove your beliefs down the throat of adherents to other
belief systems.

<a name="atheism-is-humanitys-response-to-modernism-science-and-rationalism" />

### [Atheism is Humanity's Response to Modernism, Science and Rationalism](#atheism-is-humanitys-response-to-modernism-science-and-rationalism)

Atheism appeals to people as a response to an urge to answer the same
questions that religion has attempted to answer. They are questions
that humans have asked for the entirety of history and pre-history.

#### Why are we here? Who created us?

#### What is my purpose? What is my family's purpose?

#### What is my society's purpose? What is humanity's purpose?

Atheism skirts humanity's need answer these questions by proclaiming:
none of religion's answers to those questions matter because religion
is false and science is true. Only science's answers to these
questions matter. I've covered this before, but one major difference
between science's answers and religion's answers to these same
questions is that science's answers change day by day and a religion's
answers never change! For the most part, a religion's answers to these
questions remain steadfast.

If seven billion people are running a race and the finish line changes
every hour to some random location in the world, how can they ever
finish? Could they ever even measure their progress? How can they know
where to invest their energy? Religion provides a definite goal for
the people in this race. The finish line doesn't jump all over the
place. Being able to determine where this finish line is place by
controlling the belief systems of the populations of the world is an
advantage enjoyed by an elite few in control of the premier academic
institutions across the world.

As much as atheists will preach about the abuses and sins of organized
religions, what about the sins and lies of organized science and
academia? Look at all the people who've been sicked by bad science
over the past two centuries.  There is potential for abuse in both
organized religion and organized science, as silly as that term may
sound. Establishing the institutions of science as politically
unreproachable is misguided and unwise.

The truth is that we need both religion and science.

<a name="ok-communists-you-win-for-now" />

# [Ok, Communists. You Win, For Now...](#ok-communists-you-win-for-now)

Not really. Just go with it...

Atheism is a conviction in belief that overwhelming evidence disproves
God. If science didn't give you that evidence, atheists likely would
believe something else. Why? because they would need God, just like
they NEED science. every person has a NEED to understand the world.

To me, science does give plenty of evidence for God, but let's assume
that atheists and communists win. We eradicate religion or at least
suppress it like Chairman Mao did in the Cultural Revolution.

<a name="so-what-do-you-replace-religion-with" />

### [So What Do You Replace Religion With?](#so-what-do-you-replace-religion-with)

Atheists and communists are foolish for rejecting the accumulated
wisdom of dozens of generations by rejecting Christianity and
religion. What do communists replace it with?

The Torah. The Bible. The Qu'ran. The Vedas. The Sutras. These are
great works that for centuries or even millinea would be the only
books that people continuously thought worth copying and preserving.
People thought these books were so important that they created
institutions that paid people by the hundreds and thousands to copy
them by hand! These books laid belief systems that became the
foundations of rationalism. Paganism could have never transitioned
into rationalism. It was only through the institution of religion that
science was even born.

For millinea, people thought these books were they so important, they
collected taxes to facilitate the copying of these text. People
thought these belief systems were so important that they dedicated
their greated architectural acheivements almost solely to whatever
deity was worshipped in the land.

<a name="if-youre-so-wise-then-to-whoms-statue-should-i-pray" />

### [If You're So Wise, Then To Whom's Statue Should I Pray?](#if-youre-so-wise-then-to-whoms-statue-should-i-pray)

And you're going to replace them? With what?! A statue of Saddam
Hussein or Kim Il-Sung? Wow! I bet these figures are so revolutionary
that they could replace the wisdom of a dozen generations with no
consequences to society! People across the world deserve to retain
their culture. People are different. Their societies are different and
that's a good thing. We have to learn to respect the cultures and
traditions of others, even when we don't understand them.

However, even if some totalitarian society were to eradicate religion
itself -- God, Allah, Brahma would eventually be rediscovered by
artificial intelligence. To me, religions across the world meditated
on the understanding of a being or an invisible metaphysical form that
laid the foundation of the world around them. Religions are mostly all
an understanding of the same thing. After all, while we may come frome
different lands with different flora and fauna, we all inhabit the
same world. We all must experience many of the same phenomena to live
and we must master the same concepts to thrive. Religion helped us to
master those concepts. Mystics across the world and across the pages
of time codified their understanding of what is mostly the same God
into religion.

What powers our hubris to destroy these traditions now? Especially
now, when we need God more than ever.

So go ahead, communists. Make my day. Deconstruct religion and replace
it with Party worship or some cult of personality. Eventually people
will face the reality that a superintelligent AI has a come-to-Jesus
moment. Ahh the bittersweet irony. Why don't you take that little
nugget of epiphany, tear a page out of the Communist Manifesto, shove
it in a pipe and smoke it because your foundational philosophy is
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED

# [The Important Questions Never Concern Who Is Correct and Who Is Wrong](#the-important-questions-never-concern-who-is-correct-and-who-is-wrong)

#### How do we minimize the pain of this horrendous, impending onslaught of censorship?

#### How do we avoid the pain of a great catastrophe? The world of 2030 and 2050 cannot deal with the burden and cultural legacy of billions of casualties!

#### How do we work together for common benefit? Both within our own society and accross the world?

#### Can't we use our energy to build instead of destroy? At the onset of what seems to be an apocalyptic age, isn't that what is most important today? Regardless of what we do today, our children will share the rewards and costs. We can either work together and build or we can destroy and lament.

#### What are the benefits of communism? What does it promise and why?

#### What makes communism work in some countries and why doesn't it work elsewhere?

#### How does this mesh with the realities of society and our global economy?

#### Why does government subsidized needs of all people imply a need for empire to self-sustain those finances?
