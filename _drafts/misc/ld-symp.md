Lafora Disease

- caused by Lafora Bodies: aggregation of abnormal polyglucosans
  - these are insoluable, so glial cells cannot remove them
  - the lafora bodies also aggregate all over the body
  - but neural lafora bodies present symptoms first
- Lafora Bodies aggregate in glial cells (neurons) but not astrocytes
  - astrocytes produce a much higher amount of glucosans
  - and apparently have the ability to dispose of it
  - glial cells do not produce as much, but apparently lack the ability to dispose of the mutant polygucosans
    - there is likely purpose behind the difference in astrocytes’ and glial cells’ functionality here
    - that is, a genetically engineered “cure” to dispose of glial cells may go horribly wrong
    - a bit depressing, eh? 
- there’s a connection between this disease and Easter Island
  - rapamycin (sirolimus) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirolimus

==================
TREATMENT
==================

activities
- exercise!! especially cardio! 
  - improved blood flow will help the brain & immune system deal with damage
  - so, in the short term, exercise will greatly improve symptoms
  - however, in the long term, exercise *may* slowly contribute to the accumulation of lafora bodies
  - avoid over-exertion 
- regular sleep!

diet (perhaps most important, as it reduces the momentum of disease progression)
- get your energy from fats and triglycerides, 
  - instead of receiving energy from sugar & carbs
- reduced sugar intake!! 
  - sugar => glycogen 
  - glycogen + phosphorus => hyperphosphylated glycogen => Lafora Bodies
  - need to ensure that sugar intake is consistent.  
  - it is the fluctuating levels of sugar that will lead to lafora bodies!
- control, but don’t eliminate phosphorus
- control, but don’t eliminate potassium
  - potassium apparently contributes to glycogenolysis
  - potassium is necessary for regular muscle functioning
- cease nicotine consumption (and consumption of other excitotoxic drugs)

- [Ketogenic Diet (Wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet)


active drugs:
- anti-epileptic drugs to reduce seizures
  - though i’m not sure if reducing epileptic symptoms would really address the cause
- astralagus to promote autophagy ?? wait, does it actually do this?
  - not sure if this does this in the right way
  - or if this even penetrates the brain (it should, at least indirectly, though i’m not sure)
- huperzine and other smart drugs to trigger release of NGF
  - this should be combined with drugs triggering increased autophagy
  - and should help reduce effects of dementia
- Brain Awake seems to help, a lot
  - though this is a low dose herbal combo
  - it’s a great replacement for red bull — it contains high levels of B-vitamins
- Gingko OR Vinpocetine to improve cerebral blood flow
  - this improves access to brain for the other drugs & herbs
  - too much vasodialation is a bad thing

- adderal MAY help address fatigue (also might harm)

indirect drugs & herbs:
- omega-3 supplements (reduces neurodegenerative effects)
- vitamins & supplements
- turmeric + curcumin
- antidepressant may help deal with depression resulting from dementia
- bacopa

- (NVM, won’t work) promote autophagy by activating mTOR through production of rapalogs in specific areas
  - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3182203/
  - rapamycin may cross the blood brain barrier
  - …. rapamycin activates mTOR, which *inhibits* autophagy
- promote autophagy in brain
  - possibly by inhibiting mTOR
- combine with smart drug (huperzine)
  - autophagy may cause further symptoms, but combining with NGF-drug like huperzine may help

inducing autophagy by rapamycin before, but not after, the formation of plaques and tangles amerliorates cognitive deficits
- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3182203/
- i thought rapamycin would activate mTOR and **suppress** immune activity …

nanoparticles coated in rapamycin attach to mTOR (where mTOR is more highly expressed?)
- https://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/26497.aspx
- doing so increases the likelihood that autophagy will be triggered
  - i postulate this is bc mTOR’s autophagy-inhibiting effects will be inhibited
  - because mTOR can’t be activated
- additionally, autophagy may attach to nanoparticles to help clear debris … maybe
- found this info by looking at sirolimus’ wiki page (muscular dystrophy in mice)

systemic lupus erythematosus in mice/humans
- mTOR also plays a role in this disease

==================
TODO
==================

determine the connection between lafora bodies & glycogenolysis
- what is the purpose of glycogenolysis? 
- how would potassium/phosphorus intake affect glycogenolysis

identify the symptoms of lafora body accumulation in other parts of the body

how does glycogenesis induce myoclonus
- does myclonus cause a disease like this to progress?

search for causes of other PME’s.  
- can a PME be induced?

Wild-type laforin induces autophagy by inhibiting mTOR in a TSC2-dependent manner. 
- Loss of laforin in LD activates mTOR and inhibits autophagy.
