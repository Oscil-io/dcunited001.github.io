Workplace bullying 
========================

obviously, not everything i've listed has happened TO me.
- but most everything listed IS possible or useful to a manipulator in some way.
- it's also VERY VERY important that I state not all of this is career related.  this results from my life experience.
- however, i have A LOT of experience with A LOT of VERY DIFFERENT people.  people from all over the US, in all different social classes.
- difference by income distribution: mega rich people are often conniving. poor people have a robin hood complex.
- but it's not fair to make this judgement. it doesn't matter what demographic, it contains manipulative people.
- parents, family or friends are manipulative.
- much of this behavior i describe is exhibited by drug dealers and organized crime.

it is important to note that most people 
- do not behave this way and are genuinely interested in others' best interests
- do not have the experience or the social model to manipulate people without burning themselves

normalizing sociopathic behavior:
- game of thrones, blacklist, etc, etc
- mainstream media is normalizing this behavior and it's terrible!!

modeling social behavior
- applying category theory
- everyone has their own model of how social behavior works.  some are accurate, some are terrible.

what type of person would exhibit this behavior
- afraid of losing their job.
- seeking promotion or job security? weed out threats early and set yourself up for success
- just a fucking mean ass person
- (not trying to be ageist) but i have noticed that older people have more experience and a better social model, so when they exhibit this behavior, it's worse.  (30+)

levels of self-awareness in sociopathic behavior
- responsive - only happens when the person is in a bad mood.  no overall strategy
- premeditated - person seems to have every angle and condition thought out.  usually, this person is very good at chess.  but still, only thinks out certain subjects.
- pervasive - this person always seeks to line things up, so he can use them later.  always thinking ahead, just in case.

examples of behavior i experienced
- in relationships
- in jamskating
  - room at summerjam. unlockable.  room specifically reserved by organizers of summerjam
  - certificate errors immediately upon connection to hotel network at summerjam
  - certificate errors and slow connections to specific sites (GMAIL) at other hotels for skating events
  - suspected hacking back in 2005 due to the circulation of undisclosed information
  - one of my teammates was told that he would be doing NBA and College Basketballs
    - and all he had to do was be the thorn in my side and tear everything apart.
- in the workplace
- in the software industry
- in the entertainment industry
- in general life
  - malware loaded to randomly open porn tabs while you're browsing in a coffee shop
heir computer, so you can keep tabs on them.  this was heinously easy to do 10 years ago.

tactics for managers:
- unfairly distribute work.  make sure high effort, low reward, low visibility tasks are assigned to this person.
- assign work to this person, with their weaknesses in mind.  or pick a toolset for a project that includes mostly things they don't have experience with.
- "death by micromanagement" prohibit usage of specific tools require to complete the tasks you've assigned them. 
- this is a double whammy, because usually you can ensure someone fails.  and they might even outright disobey your orders.  


Just finished ‪#‎PartOne‬ on a series of articles on ‪#‎Bullying‬ in the workplace. Through this series, I will describe how ‪#‎PassiveAggressive‬ behavior is toxic to relationships in the workplace and why ‪#‎Sociopathic‬ behavior is rampant in America.

The reason why I'm posting this here is because in 2005, I was caught blindsided by these kinds of tactics in ‪#‎Jamskating‬. I had never experienced anything like it in my life up to that point. And I was introduced to this book 48 Laws of Power through people in Jamskating.
