More good examples of unsound advice promoted through mainstream media are: 
- Fast Food isn't so bad.  Just limit yourselfz when in the drivethru.  No time to eat healthy -- now get to work motherfucker! Kyaaa Kyaaa!!
- Trans Fats aren't too bad in moderation and besides -- and you won't even believe it's not butter!! LOLZ
- High Fructose Corn Syrup in soft drinks ain't tooo bad and phosphoric acids is goods for youz.  It cleans out ur pipez lol.  Literally.

This unsound advice instills incredibly damaging beliefs in Americans.  The above statements would irrevoccably piss off Nestle, Coca Cola and Pepsi.  Oh Noez -- the profit margins of multinational corporations are sacred!!  

Nevermind that it's **financially impossible** for Americans making less than 40K per year to feed themselves food that isn't garbage.  Oh, but how much money do you have to make to avoid feeding your children garbage?

-  why i could never be a coke dealer...

#### Now that we have government provided healthcare, we are even moreso at risk for economic warfare via healthcare!  

I don't want to get involved in a debate on healthcare, so I'm going to keep it short.  As a libertarian, from a philosophical standpoint, I don't believe universal healthcare is the right way to go -- mostly I'm afraid that we just don't have the money.  However, from a practical standpoint, this has alleviated a lot of unfair stress in many American lives and has provided a significant change to a system that was broken for so many years. 

The point that I do want to mention is -- **government provided healthcare provides the government a damn good incentive for encouraging Americans to be healthy!!**  No longer can they just sit back accepting funds from industry lobbyists which allow damaging chemicals and unhealthy food grind away at our nations health.
