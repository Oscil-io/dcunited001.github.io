### One of the first programs I wrote?

I eigth grade, I wrote a freaking **computer algebra program** ... *technically*.  Ok, really, it was just a calculator program to show your work step-by-step as you solved the quadratic equation.  OK, I didn't need it, but our teacher specifically told us we couldn't use a calculator *because we had to show our work.*  So *my inherint need to question authority* sparked my curiosity to wonder if I could write a program to do that.  And it turns out, it was very easy.  So I did it.  

Not really a big deal until you consider that this small program technically falls under one of the most challenging categories of computer programs: computer algebra and automated theorum proving.  Kinda funny, but not really. I did it on a graphing calculator.

### OK -- Enough About Me ...

I really need to stop getting off on tangents in my blog posts.  I had a ton of fun this weekend and it looks like everyone else did too.
