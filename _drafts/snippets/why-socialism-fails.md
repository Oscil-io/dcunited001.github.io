Why #Socialism fails: it requires a strong economy to provide
expensive benefits for everyone, yet culturally degrades the virtues
that create a strong economy.  This inevitably leads to the loss of
values and, eventually the wealth itself, that would lead such a
situation to be possible.  The best answer for governance is not
actually as straightforward as "sunshine, unicorns and icecream for
everyone."

Sorry, you're #Myopic - you're simply not thinking of the future.

Fortunately, the price of these problematic services (such as
healthcare) will plummet, regardless of public policy. However, it's
infuriating to see both of the following: the demagogue politicians
who promise such grand reforms, full-well knowing that these reforms
represent changing economics moreso than real change; and their
followers, ignorant of the true causes of their suffering, who foist
their chosen demagogues up as some kind of salvation, without
understanding that their ideology will soon be irrelevant.


What I'm trying to say: your politics are about as useful as an
umbrella in a hurricane. Far more powerful forces will determine the
course of policy over the next decade or two. The only question is
.....

- can i have your cornbread?
- who will control this newfound power and what will they do with it?
- ... ?
