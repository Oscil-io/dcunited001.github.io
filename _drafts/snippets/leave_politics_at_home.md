### Leave Politics at Home! For your own sake!!

I've never been one to push my beliefs on others, but I've also never hidden my political beliefs online.  I'm concerned that if American society keeps marching down the path of **totalitarianism**, then ultimately, this kind of sociopathic behavior is going to become institutionalized.  That is, if it's not already.  

What do I mean?  That a certain political faction -- either right or left, it really doesn't matter -- will gain power and utilize politics and divisive tactics to wedge moderates and opposition supporters out from income-earning positions.  **Especially** those who make political donations!

The thing about extremist politics is that it evokes extremist tactics.  You're going to find Occupiers and Tea Partiers who try to unfairly push out the opposing sad.  It's sickening and I hope it doesn't come to this, but if previous revolutions show you anything, this is what happens when radicals gain power!

I'm not kidding by the way. I have had this happen to me. Politics is divisive. If someone identifies your politics, they may not harbor ill-will towards your politics, specifically. But certain people will recognize this as a tool with which to isolate you at work, by identifying other people on the opposite side and then playing you against each other.
