It really sucks when you're so passionate about so many ideas and you'd like to be part of a group of people who has the time and interest to discuss them with you.  Instead, you're told that "it's too late" to learn this stuff and that you are "crazy" for even writing certain ideas down, when many of these ideas are revolutionary.  You start blogging about them, but you've been effectively censored on facebook, so your posts get no reach.  No one would recognize how your ideas are revolutionary anyways, because they're too complicated and you don't have the right three letters after your name. Instead, you watch as others build out and profit from ideas that you were years ahead on. Because you refuse to give into the situation, you're labeled "crazy" and "unrealistic" and at no time are you ever given the positioning you need to build something, regardless of how it would have benefitted your local community. And when you stand up for yourself, you're deemed an asshole.  The biggest problem the whole time was that you were not allowed to be independent, since you simply couldn't transport yourself from point A to point B on your terms.
