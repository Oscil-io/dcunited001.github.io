"Hi dc - This will take one second.
You recently began looking for jobs on AngelList.
How likely are you to recommend AngelList to other people looking for a new job?"

It really depends on whether this person seems like they want a job in an Startup.  If so, AngelList is *the best place* to find out about new opportunities with small to medium size startups, those with 10 to 50 employees.  

I'll describe a little bit more about how I've used AngelList in my job search.  However, I'm really writing this for myself.  I save snippets of text I write on the internet and I might edit it or add some of it to my blog.

One major feature that would make a job search a little easier on AngelList would be curated lists of companies that are hiring.  This would make it easier for me to sift through everything to find the right positions and companies for me.  Curated lists of hiring startups are probably already implemented on AL to some degree.

One more thing I can think of is that there are a lot of companies who just want to keep job postings active on their profile.  This is because they know that prospective employees searching through AngelList are probably higher quality than average.  However, there are companies I know who are not actively hiring for these positions, but if the right person came along they'd hire them.  I'm not really sure how you'd address this problem or whether it's really a problem at all.

One minor gripe I have -- and it's a good problem to have =] --there are so many startups on AngelList that it makes it difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Not really a problem with AL.  It's just that there are many new startups across the country and many of their markets/products/brands/purposes overlap.  That is, there are so many companies trying to do similar things that in order to identify those who are unique or those who are likely to be successful is very difficult.  And while it sounds bad saying it, getting a job with a startup that is ultimately going to struggle after a year is not where I want to be.  And I don't mind playing for the losing team, if I felt like I was working on something revolutionary with little chance of success.

So, for me, searching for jobs on AL -- and searching for jobs in general -- so far has been fairly difficult, since it takes so much time to identify a company that I feel comfortable with.  And maybe I'm not using the features in the most effective way.  

The last time I searched for jobs on AngelList, I spent a few hours briefly surfing through hiring companies.  I narrowed down the cities to those I want to work in, which is mainly NYC, SF, Denver & Tokyo.  If the company is not remote or in one of those cities, I'm not looking for it and this is because I want to move to an area with a great tech community.  

So first, I searched through companies on the startups page instead of looking at the jobs because I'm not just looking for a job, I'm looking for a company to commit myself to.  So here, I can identify small startups to which I feel like I can contribute by being creative, as well as landing a position with some of the best stock options by being one of the first 50 employees.

But then, I found that I couldn't narrow down the companies on the Startups page by location, so I searched each location that I'm interested in.  

Basically, I ended up building a list of 30 or 40 companies that caught my eye, which is promising for spending an hour or two.  They seemed unique, possibly revolutionary, would offer good work experience or would be great work environments.  Then, I needed to go through each company to make sure it seems like a great opportunity.  I have a list of things I review for each company and usually, less than 1% of companies meet this criteria, but each company takes at least an hour to research.  

This criteria includes the following
- Are their goals and practices in line with my values
- Is their business model ethical?  Is it viable?
- What other great things have the founders and early employees accomplished?
- For startups: how is their product unique?  Does it change the game?
- How many employees work here? What are the most vital roles going to be in this business?
- How can I play a part in this business?  Am I going to be a low level programmer with no input to the product?  Or am I going to be a high level early-stage CIO who has to do everything at blazing speeds? I may be cut out for some CIO positions, but not without being able to delegate most of the work.
- How am I going to grow here?  Is this business one where'd I'd like to stay for at least a year?  If not, move on.  It's not worth it for either party.  
- Or is this the kind of business where you'd want to stay for three or four years?
- And most important, is working for this business worth mostly giving up on all my startup ideas for one to three years?  If I'm going to commit to something, I'm going to commit to it.

Typically, on any job search, I'll usually sort jobs by most recent because I want to identify the companies who are actively searching and those opportunities where I can be one of the first applicants.  I feel like there are some sorting options I used last time that I can't find anymore

Also, it's important to note that I'm not an investor and while that's appealing to me, I don't have the chips to play, so I haven't used those features.  Additionally, I don't yet have a startup or product at the point where I feel it's appropriate to market it on AngelList.  

This is because, in my projects thus far, I'm usually the only person: I have to think of branding, marketing, business strategy, business model, etc.  All that **and** I have to be the sole developer -- and I'm not exactly the fastest programmer, especially when I'm constantly distracted by other roles.  Basically, if I don't yet have an MVP and I'm stuck in Roanoke, VA with little to no networking opportunities, then it might not be wise to start marketing my ideas on AngelList.  I already know what answer I'd get from investors -- show me what you've built -- that is, if I got any answer at all with nothing built.

I realize this is more than you asked for.  However, it should give you an idea of how I've used AngelList, what I'm looking for in your product and why I think it's great for finding positions at startups.
