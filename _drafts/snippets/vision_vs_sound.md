## Vision vs. Sound

From a phenomenological perspective, hearing is much more important than vision in convincing someone of the authenticity of an experience.  No matter how good the visual effects are in a movie, I can always tell they are grainy, if I look close enough.  I can always look closer and my mind can distinguish reality from fantasy.  I can begin to see the pixels and there are other aspects of the visual sense that make it easy to determine it's not real.  And with VR, if the response time is not fast enough, you'll notice a delay in your visual field as you move around.
​
​However, as a sense, hearing is completely different.  It's much harder for the mind to closely inspect audio and determine that it's not real.  If you watch a lot of anime, you'll notice that the best ones have the best sound work and that this added effort in audio really sets these apart.  When there's a ton of effort to spatially correlate what you see on screen with the audio you hear, this allows even animated works to begin to seem real.
​
​While perfect audio is incredibly expensive to attain, as you have to begin taking into account the added reverb of your surroundings, it seems like binaural audio will bring us much closer to that.
