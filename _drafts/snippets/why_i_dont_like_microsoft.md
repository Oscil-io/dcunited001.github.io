This is partially because new technologies are risky, but also partly because the .NET cabal here is strong.  [Insert statement about how homogeny encourages weakness]

I really hate saying what I just did about my hometown, but there it is.  *Fix it.*

### *And now:* a personal story about why I don't like Microsoft.

And also, I had to wait until 7th grade to learn to program for the first time.  And get this -- * **I FIRST PROGRAMMED IN BASIC** * ... **ON A FUCKING GRAPHING CALCULATOR!**  You @$$holes didn't include any free programming tools in Windows 3.1 -- yes, I'm that old.  My family wasn't rich enough enough to afford the only programming tools you offered. The same tools that your business practicies used to help monopolize software by forcing people to use your tools on your platform, practically the only platform available for consumers at that point, as far as I knew.

So -- *NO* -- I will probably never get over the fact that you delayed my entry to programming for almost a decade.  To be fair, I didn't exactly try hard enough as a kid.  But I would check out library books and try to code myself, but end up literally crying over the fact that I didn't know how to run the code I had written.

Why weren't free programming tools included with the early versions of Windows?  They were available but interfered with Microsoft's plans for world domination.  To be fair, their business practicies are getting better and it even looks like they're wholeheartedly embracing open source!
