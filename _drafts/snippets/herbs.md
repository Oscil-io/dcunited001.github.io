yeh but science can't actually prove that herbs work. there's plenty of herbs that are very active and very effective. but herbs are treatments which can't be easily quantified and science abhors this.

science is comfortable with prescription medications because they can be quantified. yet, that number -- the strength of the dose -- is very misleading. if you give 1000 people a drug orally and you don't control variables like stomach acidity, hydration, etc, then the actual blood concentration of that drug will vary wildly in that group of 1000.

but that's exactly why science attacks herbal medications: the concentration of active ingredients can't be known. conditions under which the herb grows and speciation cause wild fluxation in groups of active chemicals produced. herbs usually contain mutliple families of active chemicals instead of just one isolated active chemical. the grown conditions (soil ph, nutrients, hydration, etc) affect how the genetics of the herb are expressed and thus affects how these families of active chemicals are produced.

this makes herbs very difficult to study. **and because science doesn't have the tools to study herbs to make confident conclusions about their efficacy, science then claims they are absolutely worthless** -- which couldn't be farther from the truth. additionally, one can easily construct studies to make it seem that an herb failed to be effective by controlling the herbs growth conditions so that they don't produce active chemicals.

herbs are basically biotechnology -- in many cases, it's almost exactly what we're trying to reproduce by genetically engineering yeast and plants.
