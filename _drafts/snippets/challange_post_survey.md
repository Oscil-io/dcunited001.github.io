### Why do you want to showcase your software?

I have a lot of projects on my Github that i've worked on.  Github is a great place to show programmers the code that you've worked on.  However, it's not so great to showcase work for non-programmers, since they often have no idea what they're looking at.  And usually, these are the people initially filtering job applicants.  

So if you want to get a job interview, it's great to have blog posts about projects you have worked on.  However, my Github profile has way too many half-completed or barely started software projects.  So when I apply to jobs, I like to include links of three or four projects in particular that showcase my creativity.  

Even if I were to send someone a link to my blog, they might be overwhelmed with the number of posts I've made and miss the diamonds in the rough, so to speak.

But ChallengePost is a great place to showcase projects and include pictures -- and pictures are worth a thousand words.  It's less about how you've done something and more about briefly showing someone the projects that you pride yourself on.  You can add details which succinctly explain why you are proud of this work and what makes it different.  And someone else can get a picture of how creative you are.

### Who did you share your Portfolio with? Why?

i haven't actually shown my portfolio to anyone yet.  i need to add a few projects.  I think I'm going to continue filling it out with a few more projects and then I can link it in job applications.  

if i'm trying to find a group of talented hackers to work with at a hackathon, then i could show my ChallengePost so they could see why i'm worthy.

I can also link it on my blog.  This is great because now I don't really have to complete all these half-finished technical blog posts I've written =) Especially when they'd mostly be blog posts concerning something that has already been written about.  It's much easier for me to blog about philosophy and hypothetical economic systems and sci-fi critiques and real-life applications of math and... well, things that are fun to write about.

### How would you improve Portfolios?

I haven't used the product enough to really say.  however, i'll explain what i like so far.  i originally heard about challenge post at Hack4CO in Colorado, i believe.  however, it wasn't until last weekend when i attended the MLH event VT Hacks when i decided it'd be worthwhile to fill out my profile.  

i like the markdown and the suggested sections for descriptions of projects.  that kind of forethought means that everyone's descriptions are going to be a little better because they're all more likely to address the details of projects which help communicate ideas to other people.

i like the fact that you can quickly import projects from Github.  this is great, but i found that the software didn't really automatically do anything when i imported from Github. However, I'm not sure that there would be anything automated you can do with this, which you could be sure to work well and be relevant 100% of the time.  It's a great suggestion for new users though: what could I import from my Github to showcase here?

i also like the Staff Picks, Trending Projects and Built with X sections.  The tags you can use to describe projects and discover other projects based on technologies is great.  And the information you include on projects is all succinctly defined so that it's well-defined and applicable in Big Data and Reporting later on.

So i'm having a hard time thinking of features to improve Portfolios.  However, i think that's a good thing!  Also, I believe that web applications should remain simple and just do what they're good at.  Anyone can add more and more features to a product, but that hurts a product's brand, as it becomes less clear what that product is meant to do.  It's important to expand your product, but more important to do it in the right way.

I'm just checking "visit to our office in NYC" because free beer is awesome.  I'd love a free trip to NYC lulz.. But i'm wary of the free lunch.  If you want my input, email/chat is probably fine, but I'd need to use your product more to give you anything useful.  Just saying, since you asked .. kinda lol
