I'm getting ready to blog about how over-consumption of sugar/HFCS during youth alters the patterns of gene expression for children. When you're young, your body seeks to establish these patterns of gene expression, which have a far greater impact on your metabolism/etc than your genes themselves!! 

By the way, gene expression is like a probability based program with feedback loops. It's highly variable and highly dependent on your diet, metabolism and environment.

While this sounds complicated, the problem is the way in which we market JUNK FOOD to kids. Similar to how tobacco was marketed towards kids, they end up "choosing" to consume extremely unhealthy foods before they are able to understand what they are doing or how they have addicted themselves. 

This ends up tuning their genes in such a way that predisposes them for obesity, as well as other physical and mental health problems. Once these patterns of gene expression are set during youth, they are very, very difficult to change. Some changes can occur during adulthood and usually require changing diet for at least one month, in the very least. Sometimes these patterns may require years of change in diet/exercise/environment in order to change.

epigenetics is a **paradigm shift** in medicine. understanding how genes function together and how diet/nutrition/exercise affect gene expression will mean that medicine finally learns just how wrong they have been over the past few decades! bad science and malnutrition is fueling health crises across our country, which have the capacity to ultimately bankrupt us.

No one wanted to listen to me over the past decade, but it turns out that I'm correct. Like almost every single time. And I'm the same guy that your beloved marijuana prohibition policies would have rotting in jail! The cumulative effects that I have faced from your failed policies have very nearly ruined my life! When all I have been trying to do is call attention to unjust policies and corrupt science that are ruining our nation.
