Ancient forms of math

some guy in the 16th century supposedly invented logarithms? come on, ancient people weren't stupid. they had to know how to permute a function's arguments to arrive at the logarithm. we assume most math was invented in europe in the 16th-18th centuries and that's dumb. for example, indians in the 14th century were doing stuff with derivatives, infinite series and possibly stuff paralelling the Runge-Kutta method. there's no way you can do that math and not know what a !@$#'ing logarithm is.

IMO, ancient greeks were far more advanced in math than we give them credit for. however, they probably didn't do much with algebra, calculus, etc because that's computationally expensive and not useful to ancient people, as it's mostly applicable in science. however, there are forms of math these ancient peoples would have to have known about. i need to do more research and reading on the subject to develop a more informed opinion.
