 Wireless Battery Powered Headphones

One aspect of wireless battery-powered headphones is that [i think...] you don't need a headphone amp to enjoy the full sound -- since it would be stupid for the manufacturers to not have the battery to output the proper amperage! And this seems to be the case, since my Beats sound completely different than other headphones i've worn. They seem to be missing crisp mid-upper range though.

Although the sound is digital, the convenience is overwhelming. If you're complaining about digital audio and you're not using these in studio GTFO honestly. lulz.

I've got the Wireless Studio Beats and I enjoy them, though the specs on beats aren't as great as Sennheisers for the same price. I got in a lil argument with some friends about this on facebook though. They claimed that Sennheiser Open Ear Momentums weren't that great because they are closed ear & not open ear ... WTF? I've never heard that. 

All I know is that I've looked up the detailed stats for Momentums and nearly every other headphone from the $300 to $700 range and NOTHING COMPARED! The 30hz & 300hz square wave reproduction is just about as good as you can get for $400! Other stats are great, too.

And my friends were busting on the Beats. I actually enjoy my Beats, though I realize they're not the best. But I purchased the black on black color, so that it's harder to recognize that I'm wearing beats, lulz. Oh and some of these guys are Full Sail students & grads. So of course, I'm the fucking idiot. LULZ again.
