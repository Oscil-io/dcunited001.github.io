In a 21st century ‪#‎Totalitarian‬ ‪#‎Society‬, you will see an orchestrated effort to influence people's minds using the techniques of ‪#‎Occupational‬ ‪#‎Therapy‬ to achieve the injustices described in this article. Certain groups of people will be labeled, isolated, pushed out of work and restricted from participation in society, online and IRL. This may sound impossible, but is actually easier to accomplish than it seems, as it's not too different than fascist regimes and cultural revolutions in the 20th century. Sounds crazy, doesn't it? So does the NSA's surveillance apparatus.
