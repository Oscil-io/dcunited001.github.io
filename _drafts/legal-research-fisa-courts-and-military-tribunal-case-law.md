excerpt: "
That's right, they out there fuckin' Lady Libery down by the harbor
and everyone in Manhattan can hear that bitch screaming, but because
she's got a bag on her head and she's asphixating from the gag in her
throat, it's OK. It's OK folks. She probably likes it. Lady Liberty's
turnin blue in the face and somebody's running a train on her and
everyone knows it, but ... it's OK?

# Fisa

- questions:
  - what are the differences


### [Fisa (pre-2008)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act_of_1978_Amendments_Act_of_2008)



### Fisa (post-2008)

- it's what Bush set up on his way out
  - seems to have shaken things up quite a bit.
  - I wonder which interests had control over this at the time. I
    can't remember how I felt on the FISA reform.
- Section 702 seems to be controversial
  - many cases and analyses that very recently are challenging FISA

### FISA Misc


From Wikipedia:

> The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act makes it illegal to
> intentionally engage in electronic surveillance under appearance of
> an official act or to disclose or use information obtained by
> electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act knowing
> that it was not authorized by statute; this is punishable with a
> fine of up to $10,000 or up to five years in prison, or both

Ok, yeh, that's a big deal. Because there are government authorized
actions in my case in which it would appear the government is
frightening disorganized and unaware of it's own actions. And
therefore, with regard to unauthorized wiretapping via overeager
"employees" in front organizations, either it is:

- incompetent, unaccountable or malici

Furthermore, this unauthorized action combines with the
[State Action Doctrine](http://www.conservapedia.com/State_action_doctrine)
from the 14th Amendment: basically DHS or the Military or the feds can
do anything they want through a front organization.  Because the 14th
Amendment only *restricts* the Federal Government's actions with
regard to official *government-sanctioned entities*, then if you can't
PROVE it, it doesn't matter how some *supposedly
non-government-sanctioned entity* treats you or deceives you into
artificially limiting your rights. Unless you can connect the dots b/w
that organization and the government, they are free to abuse those is
very sinister ways.

### [State Action Doctrine (14th)](http://www.conservapedia.com/State_action_doctrine)

[State Action Requirement](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/state_action_requirement):

# Bankruptcy Law:

Because bankruptcy contains the word bank and implies a loss of money,
of course you already know that it's magically treated differently law
processed in other courts. Why? Because you damn well know those
bastards are gonna get their money and if they don't, then they gonna
make sure you pay. I think ... anyways, I don't know.

Actually, bankruptcy's probably set up this way for reasons that only
occur during time of major social shift, economic calamity or
war. Because, again, those guys gonna get their money and no matter
what, the people that went out of business or whatnot have to go
through bankruptcy.

This was the grounds for challenging some points in the ANS cases,
Marshall v. Marshall, etc. Eventually, the question of which courts
had jurisdiction: either *some courts* or the *bankruptcy courts*. In
some cases, it significantly impacts things in a magical way. For
example, if the prosecution wants to be dicks about evidence
discovery or something.

Say it's the guy from Scarface. No, better: it's the guy from Blow,
but he didn't go to jail. He made a ton of money, but wait -- yeh,
actually he went to jail because they busted him in the US because
they thought he had a ton of cocaine, but all he had was a bunch of
money. Like millions of dollars and a yacht & a beachouse.

So they seize all of it, but the cops are dirty and realized that they
can fuck over the Blow guy & act like it never happened, but still
pursue legal action through courts. The Blow guy, George Jung, has
documentation for his assets that the DEA doesn't know about, but they
don't realize it and think they belong to some other entity, which is
why they figured they could snatch it and no one would second guess
shit. Well, they didn't realize George was wise like that. They
figured he was just some coke kingpin. they definitely don't want
people to find out what they did, so they suppress evidence discovery
of facts relating to the case, including what the DEA knew and when.

Well, yokes on y'all. George gets the DEA to run down several legal
strategies which solidify their stance on *facts* in the case to
courts and to the record. They didn't realize George knew
international and monetary law like that, but he's a coke dealer and a
good one too. The coke dealers that survive have the best legal
advice. So George forces them to choose arguments they can't back out
of, then George Jung declares bankruptcy in his clean business in the
US which owned all the assets via some convoluted holding structure
set up with several companies ... that unfortunately connect back to
his illegal drug kingpin activities, but George is pissed. He doesn't
care. He just wants justice at this point and they seized his
yacht. Yeh, the one with the helipad and the replica
[Focke-Achgelis Fa 223](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focke-Achgelis_Fa_223). They
don't just make those things. No, the intellectual property for those
was seized by the Office of Alien Property Control after WW2 and blah
blah blah.

Anyways, now that the government's been forced to play cards, they
picked a strategy, thinking they could win and now can't back out. So
George finally shows his by flipping out the bankruptcy, which is
legit because the feds forced that company underwater and far into the
red by seizing it. They might as well have burnt it to the
ground. Employees had no idea what was coming and it was actually
clean because it was set up under a pseudonym tied to a Swiss holding
bank or some shit. Some real Jordan Belfort shit, but somebody had a
big mouth and then someone else told the feds they could get away with
it. But then the feds didn't find anything. At this point they're just
trying to keep all that water from sinking their boat. They knew what
they did was wrong, but they just can't admit it. It's not the only
wild card George has, but he's tired of getting fucked with and the
people in "jail" haven't really been treating him right either.

Anyways, Bankruptcy's the international/financial law equivalent of
flipping the table and it only works in specific circumstances, AFAIK.
And it might not work, even then. As it is, bankruptcy's not really a
good move, ever. I don't really know why or how it works out. I just
know that it seems like it would piss financial people off and if you
use it to further legal means ...  well, now you've pissed those
people off too. And they really didn't think they were going to lose
like that. They had their eye on that yacht for a long time and were
sure it was a slam dunk.

All I know is that, in my own personal circumstances... it really
parallels the last 45 minutes of the Big Short. The bankers never
though they'd lose, but when they started to, it turns out that a few
of the bankers from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs secretly stacked
the deck because they feared that exact "impossible" situation that
would never happen. They did so secretly because as the movie showed,
none of those bankers were aware of the Credit Default Swap as a legal
financial structure for hedging against mortgage defaults. That means
whatever those Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bear Sterns,
etc. bankers set up was either instituted at the last minute under
false pretenses or it was cleverly hidden. Worse, the banker's
undisclosed CDS options pre-empted the payout for the investors, which
almost bankrupted those guys. And worse still, even after that, the
big banks and investment firms were bouncing their assets around in a
sad shell game.

It really highlights the truth that underlies all contracts: whoever
has the pen, the paper and the lawyers wins. If one party has all
access to that and you have none, then you're not going to win. Under
almost all circumstances, you just don't stand a chance.

# [Independent Council (OIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Office_of_the_Independent_Counsel)

### Watergate

- [Saturday Night Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre)

### [Ethics in Government Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_in_Government_Act)

- forced public disclosure of financial and employment history of
  public officials and their immediate family
- the law was passed in 1978, years after Watergate and the Sat. Night Massacre

### [Morrison v Olson (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison_v._Olson)

- first case where the OIC was challenged in the USSC, but was smacked
  down 7-1 with Scalia dissenting.
  - dissenting argument was that the OIC paralleled the fourth branch
    of the government
    - even though IMO there is clear potential for abuse if, say,
      Nixon were to have influence over or knowledge of the Watergate
      prosecution.
  - counterargument was that OIC was technically part of the Executive
    Branch: *"Instead, even though the President could not directly
    fire an Independent Counsel, the person holding that office was
    still an officer of the Executive branch, and not under the
    control of either the U.S. Congress or the courts"*

### Kenneth Starr


### Replaced by Office of Special Council (DOJ OSC)



# Cases

### [Marshall v Marshall (2006)]()

- The supreme court decides in ANS's favor on some of the issues
  - this original USSC case resolved some of the questions presented
  - but didn't resolve all the questions handed up from 9th Circuit



### [Stern v Marshall (2011)]()

- Anna Nicole Smith dies from heart attack before her case was completed
  - big surprise there, considering the nature of the case
  - it really looks like that's kind of the norm here.
- Stern continues the case after her death
  - to follow up on further questions handed up from 9th circuit court
  - because apparently what's important here isn't a dead widow's
    protracted suffering after losing her husband, it's making a point
    about bankruptcy technicalities.
