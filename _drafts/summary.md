- mention importance of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning classes & Dan
  Boneh's Crypto classes on teaching me the math fundamentals to
  envision anything beyond the basics.
  - if it hadn't been for Coursera and free education expanding my
    mind, I never would have gotten anywhere.
  - at the same time, i would have prefered the academic experience or
    at least a more social experience, but that just doesn't work for
    me.  explain? or cut?

- section on business pursuits and
- move this to about me? i at least need a link from the top
  - the problem with my site and the content is that it is not
    navigable. there's no discovery, aside from the tag cloud, which
    needs to be adjusted...
  - there's no way for people to discover what is relevant to them
  - it's almost a blessing that i'm able to write about so many
    topics. this makes it easy to market from one standpoint and hard
    to market my writing/blog from another standpoint
    - on one hand, i can post as many links as i want, rotating
      through various channels
      - i'll never exhaust my content and my channels. EVER!
    - i can consistently generate sessions and high (10:00-30:00)
      average session times!
      - however, this takes quite a lot of work
    - on the other hand, a visitor to my website is mostly unable to
      sort through to find the stuff that is interesting to them
      - or identify what i've written and why.
      - that's kinda the purpost of this. it's an overview of the
        things i've written. and in less than 4,000ish words people
        get an overview of the better content.

## Thanks For Reading!

Anyways, I deal with people who are just going for the legs
basically. They want to make me unsure of myself by insulting me and
deriding my work, all while preventing me from having the opportunity
to connect with others. Someone recently attacked me for being proud
of the fact that I’ve published 45,000 words on my blog since
July. That’s ridiculous. She attacked me by saying that the definition
of “published” requires some authority to bless the content for
“publication.” I don’t care if anyone publishes my writing. It’s just
some random person discrediting me by attacking my ideas, hoping that
no one else will give them a chance. We went back and forth on
Facebook until there were 200 comments LMAO. Why would they waste the
time?

I’m self-taught, so my style and form isn’t “academic.” The only
philosophy book I’ve completely read is The Republic. I got halfway
through Ethics. I know my writing has problems, but my ideas are
original AFAIK. Some of them are anyways or at least they could be. My
point is, the ideas behind my writing are interesting. They are
fascinating, if I may say so myself. Sometimes, these ideas mirror
some that have been discussed ad infinitum. And sometimes they are
completely original and worthy of at least criticism!
