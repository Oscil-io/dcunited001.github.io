Human civilization is currently undergoing (a paradigm shift) of
cultural flux, precipitated by modernization, globalization and the
Singularity. Does this shift imply an opportunity for the next major
belief system to establish the semiotic foundation of human thought
for the next astrological age? Yes, it does. However, this is not an
opportunity. It's a necessicity and something that must be handled
with care (and) unparalleled foresight. We must revise semiotic
frameworks used by humanity (...)

- trying to design teleological connections by weaving semiotics
  together
  - TODO: more about teleology
  - the idea of engineering semiotics and semiotic mappings to produce
    particular teleological qualtiies in the world. this becomes more
    difficult as cultural change accelerates, which is why studying
    cultural universals and the ways in which our life adapts to
    technology is (crucial). (reword this?)

- the paradigm of probabilistic computing when applied to mythos as
  compressed semiotic information.
  - the mythos gives us a large collection of ideas and beliefs that
    can be applied in various ways, each creating impressions in
    believers and tending to evoke imitation from believers
    - it's no different than how a genomic program is probabilistic
      computation: each imitated belief can be randomly executed,
      altering the environment to change the distributions determining
      the rates of execution of each (idea or idea-type) encoded into
      the religion or belief system
      - idea/belief/practice/custom
  - type theory so that the semiotic elements comprising a compressed
    mythos are applicable to many more situations
    - that is, with a more liberal interpretation of religious text,
      one gets a wider lens of applicable situations for a given
      element of the text

- the evolutionary dynamics of mythos

How do we adapt our culture to the (fundamentally different cultural
paradigm created by modernization)

- This post covers specific systems of signs and symbols often used as
  semoitic binding points for myths.

- "the prophecy"
  - grab content from 'parapets of alexandria'
  - materialization of the metaphysical emerges in the physical at an
    exponential rate because of the convergence of information via the
    internet, the degree of interconnectedness in the 21st century and
    the speed at which an idea travels.
  - that is, the degree of influence that a simple idea has is
    unmeasureably greater now than it was a century ago. this
    phenomenon will only become more prominent.
- this is why we must become more familiar with the nature of ideas,
  the phenomenon of an
  [egregore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore) and recognize how
  the quickening manifestation of ideas influences reality.
- this phenomenon has existed from time immemorial, but today
  influences the world in a fundamentally different way, which
  necessitates handling information and ideas in an (equally different
  way.)

# [Semiotic Binding Points in the Human Condition](#semiotic-binding-points-in-the-human-condition)

Any set of signs common to a culture, nation or region can be
overlayed and mapped with multiple meanings.

- This is true of signs to a varying degree of frequency... wtf?
- Of particular interest:
  - the propensity for similar maps to arise between geographically
    distinct cultures to produce similar maps
  - also, are there roles that need to be satisfied or are often
    satisfied between different cultures.
  - these two phenomena combined are another reason that world
    religions share so many common traits.
    - ... my brain.. .wtf

### [Astrology, Commerce, Agriculture and Architecture](#astrology-commerce-agriculture-and-architecture)

Perhaps the most constant set of signs in the semiotic sense,
astrology was the only (stratum) of phenomena found to be completely
constant to pre-historic man. The weather was seasonal and
varied. Children were born young and died before old age. Previous
generations left their mark, but it faded fast. Stories and myths
could be lost. Even the earth changed from time to time, but the stars
were the only thing that never, ever changed, though it would have
been difficult to verify to any degree of certainty. The pursuit of
understanding the inner workings of celestial bodies -- their
usefulness in regard to navigation and determining geography and
eventually in profiting from commerce -- doubtlessly inspired
measurement, quantification, the transmission of knowledge, and its
maintainance.  Around the time we began to explore more complicated
verbal language, how would one explain to someone else the constant
nature of stars? How would someone prove that? How can one prove
something in the physical world is constant without measuring it?
Those questions likely lead us to pursue monolithic works and
eventually architecture. Anything which broke from the constant nature
of the stars would have been perceived as incredibly important.
e.g. planets and supernovae.

Furthermore, as a set of signs, astrology is unique across the world
.. to a degree. The northern and southern hemispheres experience
things differently and different stars are visible at different points
in the year.

The developments of primordial astrology, commerce, agriculture and
architecture were incredibly important to humanity's development from
a phenomenological perspective. Each of these represent a paradigm
shift in humanity's understanding of how we related to the world.
Astrology represents our ability to make measurements. Commerce
represents our ability to understand need and desire, to coordinate
human activity and to intentionally precipitate social hierarchy, and
to reward innovation. Agriculture represents a paradigm shift in how
we could live and separated humanity from limiting its food source to
that provided by nature and thus, eliminated many constraints on our
suitable geographic environments.  Architecture represents a
transformation in how humanity relates to our world: we began to see
the effects or greatness of those who came before us; we developed an
understanding of legacy and perhaps some kind of dominance over death;
we understood that we could separate ourselves from the dangers of the
natural world. After these four elements came the economic need for
written language and law.

### [Math and Science](#math-and-science)

Another set of fairly or very constant signs are mathematical and
scientific truths and laws, though these didn't arise quite as early
as those signs from astrology. These require a priori knowledge to
have much significance or the capacity for transmission without
communication. If you learn enough and look often enough, you'll find
that everything is more than it seems at the surface. What lies
beneath can be very useful, but is often confusing and more trouble
than its worth.

#### [Gene Ontology](http://www.geneontology.org/), powering bioinformatics and oncological data science

![A Visualized Genetic Ontology](/img/posts/2017-02-14-oneirontology-engineering-cultural-touchstones-for-mythos/gene-ontology.jpg)

- scientology's use of an ontological perspective based on science as
  a pattern language.
  - they're like the fucking Mensa Mafia.

<a name="architypical-events-in-human-history" />

### [Architypical Events in Human History](#architypical-events-in-human-history)

- the creation of the world
  - and the proposed solution to the problem of evil
  - every religion needs to explain a beginning, somehow
    - even tribal societies passed down oral traditions of a
      beginning.
  - because the story of a beginning is itself a universal facet of
    human culture, then it itself is a symbol.
- calamitous events (Noah's Flood, etc)
  - Noah's Flood is a deep rooted architypical event which serves to
    provide each new generation with an understanding that humanity &
    civilization are impermanent. In the Judeo-Christian tradition,
    the story of Noah's Flood reminds us that we exist at the grace of
    God.

### Architypical Events/Phenomena in the Human Experience

- birth and death
  - everyone has a birth
  - everyone has a death
  - everyone can relate to these things
  - and ... everyone has a v-card
- hunger & thirst
- virginity (& purity)
- right and wrong

### Human Relationships (Family/Friendship)

- family relationships are shared by almost everyone.
  - lack of father/mother/parents produces some of the
    highest-magnitude shifts in a person's psychology
    - lack of presence or loss of a parent produces similarly dramatic
      shifts in a person's psychology
  - those relationships are at least known to everyone
    - father, mother, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, grandparents
    - they might mean different things to different people in various
      cultures, but the presence of these signs as mapple in terms of
      semiotics is universal
  - and family relationships are a set of symbols with profound
    strength.
    - even if someone is reading about the father/mother of Zeus or
      Persephone or Heracles, there is a subtle profundity influenced
      by factors such as family relationships which molds the lens
      through which we experience those stories

- perhaps distubingly, this is a set of symbols which could be erased!
  - think Brave New World, where children have state imposed family.
    - artificial reproduction supplants familial relationships of
      biological origin
  - Orwellian assaults on family are real. A tyrannical government
    will leap straight for the corrosion of the family as the
    strongest set of relationships in nearly every individual's life
    - this isn't new: it was life-as-usual in Greek Sparta
      - some Spartan's were separated from their family at birth and
        raised as ruthless soldiers
  - we are seeing this to some degree now and we need to be prepared
    because an overreaching government evolving towards tyranny *will*
    seek to undermine family.
    - it's not methodic or systematic now, but it very well could be.
    - God help us if we let tyrants get away with it!!

### Animals & Animal Behavior

- local fauna

### Plant Life And Medicene

- local flora

#### Medical Uses, Geographic Distribution, Cultural Significance and Plant Interaction

#### Agriculture

### Psychology & Psychiatry

- in the case of modern society, psychology and psychiatry can be
  mapped in to a language.
  - this is really what the occult and system of magick were about.
  - creating systems that could map to features and phenomena in the
    human mind, in an attempt to control them.

### Weather Events

- rain, drought, etc
- these are less likely to be completely universal, but there
  presence/absence is mappable via semiotics.
  - and again, for millenia, people have reached for mythology as a
    means of explaining these phenomena.
    - even if they believed a myth about the Great Flood in the Epic
      of Gilgamesh to be false, they still derived useful information
      from mythology about that event or about flooding and how it
      could affect people
      - therefore a total assault on religion or an extinction of
        mythology/religion will lead to a humanity that is inherently
        less equipped to deal with life, people, cultures and events
        (common & rare)

### Health/Disease/Anatomy



### Human Behavior

- emotions, emotional progressions
- eating, sex, things that every person must do
- passage of time: "Day"

### Misc Phenomena

... Everybody Poops


# Ragnarok

Still, Ragnarok is more than this (TODO: edit to update
connective). It is pre-literary futurism. It shows that the ancients
knew far more than they are given credit.  Ragnarok symbolizes the end
of the world as we know it. Like most other apocalypse myths from the
age of Pisces, the end of the world symbolizes the changes introduced
from exponential population growth.

During Ragnarok, the Norse Gods return one final time. In this myth,
Thor struggles against Jormungand, a snake streching around the
world. This snake is an Ouroborosian symbol, which is critical in
composing an interpretation of what Jormungand represents. Ouroboros
is a snake that grasps its own tail. It's a symbol found in many
esoteric traditions and one that represents a group dynamic where the
strong devour the weak for sustenance and to cleanse the group of
weakness. It's pretty evil.

###

However, theres another meaning to Jormungand, which lies closer to
another interpretation of Ouroboros: the global economy. But first, if
the snake has curled around the world, then it would be impossible for
the Nords to be unaware of the spherical shape of the world or at
least the possibility. And, as the stewards of Thule and Hyperboria,
*constantly travelling in and out of the Arctic Circle*, the Nords
were perhaps the people *most* aware of the spherical shape of the
world. The Nords were *well-versed in navigation* and *travelled from
close to the Arctic Circle to close the the equator. **It would be
impossible for the Nords to navigate their corner of earth while being
unaware of the spherical shape of the Earth**.

###

The previous sentence should be read as: if you know anything about
navigating with 15th century technology, Columbus was a cover story
for incidental genocide. The ignorance of Columbus is the greatest lie
of Western history. The degree to which this lie has been spread
through Western history tells you a lot about the quality and
trustworthiness of historical records themselves: they don't account
for secret and top secret information. Why would the West lie about
America and keep it secret from the time of
[St. Brendan the Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan)?
Because the West didn't want the rest of the world to know that North
America was ripe for the picking. Again, why? Because western maritime
navigability was inferior until the era before the Renaissance.

###

So... Columbus is a lie, partly to cover genocide. *WOOPS WE DIDN'T
MEAN TO!!* ... It was an "accident" and nothing more. Do you feel any
better? What about the rest of history? How many teachers in America
will look you in the eye and tell you the story of Columbus? So,
before this is all finished, the rest of the Illuminati's secrets will
be revealed. And no, this ain't no !@#$'ing Youtube documentary.

Talking about the Illuminati is a great way to immediately discredit
yourself, especially if you are correct. The "Illuminati" always knew
that the time would could when all their sins throughout history would
be out in open air in front of everyone. It's not like they didn't see
it coming. And it's not like they can't justify their dirty laundry:
they all know what they've done and they hate themselves for it. It's
a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.

Just to be clear: the Illuminati's guilt is an unfortunate dependency
of the stability of society. The only way for their sins to remain
undiscovered in a time of unprecedented free information exchange is
if they burn the whole system down, hording technology for themselves
for total dominance over mankind ad infinitum. Self-restraint is
appropriate when discussing the Illuminati because when you finally
realize how they work and how prevelant they are through society, you
will be terrified.

You can't learn about linguistics and semiotics without learning what
they have done with human culture, but you will never really know who
they are because they are everywhere. To most people, their level of
control over culture is unfathomable and appears supernatural. It is
not. The Illuminati are obsessed with knowing who is getting close to
being capable of learning or being dangerous. They watch certain
fields of knowledge. If you get close, they will insert themselves
into your life and co-opt your soul. They will choke you off first,
then try to buy you off, then try to destroy anything and everything
around you if you do not cooperate.

### Ragnarok Was Pre-Literary Futurism

- TODO: some of this is necessary as an example of well-architected
  cultural compression/archival through myth
  - but these ideas are terribly organized

The goal of Ragnarok was to preserve culture so that it could be
triggered later in an event-driven manner. The story is

IMO, when modernization threatens to homogenize all culture and
Jormungand symbolizes global trade. As Jormungand stretches across the
world, this represents fully globalized trade routes and the liquidity
that ebbing around the world.

A time when trade becomes global and when modernism threatens to
homogenize all culture.

  - the authors of Ragnarok wrote it down (in the Poetic Edda?) during
    a time of cultural turmoil
  - in other words, they knew their culture would disappear and that
    the Christian persecutions of western Europe would spread
    northward.
    - to some degree the most influential Nords may have been in
      agreement with utilizing Christianity to solidify Europe against
      Islam and any other major cultural movements from the Middle
      East.
    - these people were aware of Islam (again, they fought in the
      greatest road trip of the middle ages: the 2nd Crusades, circa
      end of 11th century)
      - they even brought back islamic jewelry from the middle east,
        which apparently baffled archaeologists for some time. there
        was a ring with arabic inscriptions found at a nordic burial
        site or something.

### Europe has always been obsessed with geopolitical cultural unity

- amoung others with political influence at the time -- think
  pre-Charlemagne Gaul (~7th century) through Medici Italy
  (15th century)
  - they would have been aware that, as long as Europe remained
    culturally united on the basis of Christianity, it would be much
    more capable of handling external threats, regardless of the
    consequences of internal conflict.
  - but the second that Islam crept in the back door (via
    people's minds, etc) and gained significant geopolitical
    foothold from within Europe, this would be a major
    problem.
    - this is because of the geopolitical and economic situation
      during the dark/middle ages: Europe's imports/exports were
      tightly coupled to trade in the middle east.
    - as long as Europe and the Middle East remained geographically
      and politically independent, that trade fostered prosperity in
      both Europe and the Middle East
      - but if either Europe or the Middle East were to obtain
        complete dominance over the region, that balanced &
        well-intentioned prosperity would give way to a system whereby
        either:
      - Europe becomes isolated & impovershed or the Middle East loses
        the ability to profit from Silk Road trade in its region
        - the entireity of 5,000 years of history can be accurately
          summarized by simply looking at the Silk Road, the economics
          of each region trading on it, and the politics of whoever
          controlled specific regions of it

### Neo-Ragnarok
