<h1 class="text-center font-title">Ideas</h1>

<p>Here's a list of ideas I've had over the past decade or so.  Some of them I've started, but most I haven't had the time or the money to pursue.</p>

<h2>Top Ideas</h2>

<h3>Social Music Production (2011)</h3>
<p>Backup and version control for hardware & software configs</p>
<p>Share configurations with users from around the world</p>
<p>Learn how to create better config's using your synthesizers, drumkits, amps, mixes, etc.</p>
<p>Rate and Comment on other's music configurations</p>
<p>Currently worked on by Splice.com (2014)</p>
<p>Still have ideas to compete with splice</p>

<h3>Github for Music Production (2011)</h3>
<p>Collaborate on music production productions with more than just Dropbox</p>
<p>Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software businesses are quickly adding social features to their products</p>
  <p>- But they're doing it wrong.  They're forcing users to commit to their DAW Software and locking users into their ecosystem</p>
<p>This project is currently worked on by Blend.io (2013)</p>
  <p>- Blend.io's mistake is using Dropbox because Dropbox doesn't have enough extensibility</p>

<h2>2014</h2>

<h3>Song Request App for my family's skating rink (July 2007)</h3>
- Used Ruby on Rails 1.2
  - Used de.licio.us and script.aculo.us for AJAX
- The kids on Friday and Saturday night loved requesting songs using the application
  - Which I ran on my laptop and the DJ computer
- Didn't know anything about startups at this point
- So i didn't know where to go from an alpha product: 
  - How to develop the product further
  - Or how to pursue Angel Investment funds
- I also didn't realize how much money Ruby Developers made
- Wanted to launch this project in rinks across the country
  - in order to collect data on music that the 10-15 year old market wanted to listen to
  - also thought about launching in other venues, like bars and restaurants
- Did not want to monetize by accepting money per request
