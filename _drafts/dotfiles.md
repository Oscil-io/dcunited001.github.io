- why alterant, dotfiler and ellipsis are good
- why yadm, homeshick, vsch, dotbot,s.u.s. don't really make the cut
  - gnu stow replaces most of these
- ideally dotfiles & management tools should:
  - be written in bash. this is hard.
  - have minimal dependencies.  
    - imo, one binary depency is ok. helps if it's installable by apt-get or something
      - one *stock* python dependency is ok too, i guess
  - be very quick to install
  - should not make me think about how to maintain them
    - unless it's a clever methodology that makes sense and doesn't introduce too much complexity
  - should be deployable to multple platforms
    - it should handle multiple devices for each platform well
    - it should do so stupidly
  - configs should be composable
    - this is useful when constructing per-platform configs
    - dotfiler seems to do this very well
    - i'm toying with the idea of composable templates that are rendered on deploy
      - this seems overly complicated though, as changes require a rebuild
      - but may couple nicely with terminal profiles and per-project configs
  - custom yaml formats are right out, unless they really add value
    - if you can write yaml for something, you can write a shell script
    - alterant is yaml that adds value, it's basically rake for dotfiles
      - i still wouldn't store my encrypted anything in a public repo though
    - yaml almost certainly introduces a language like
  - should take per-project configs into account
    - for long-term projects, this is very useful
  - i really like the managers that have per-project or per-topic repos
    - i prefer submodules, even though it's added complexity
  - repo's should be shareable (this is why i like submodules)
  - configuration should be easily discoverable
  - should leave your shell with a fast startup time
    - and minimal configuration.  i'd rather not have every alias and every function enabled.
- ideas:
  - containerization using docker?
    - construction of per-project containers?
    - i just really don't like the idea of all my languages and all my scripts/functionality
      - being available at all times on my shell
