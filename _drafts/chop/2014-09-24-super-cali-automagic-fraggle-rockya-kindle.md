Try saying that five times fast -- LOL

### I'd love to read your New Age article

But I just don't have time!  Magic metahealing and crystal metaphysics are just going to have to wait.
 I know, I'll add it to my [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) list.  
 
### What's Pocket? 

The Pocket app is great for that; it lets you build a list of articles to read later.  20-page manifestos, 
whatever it is -- you don't have time for it?  add it to your Pocket and read it later!

Pocket's free and has a 
[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj?hl=en)
so you can save a blog post for later with the click of a button.  Pocket also reformats the articles, so they're 
easier to read on an iPad or iPhone.  

> Easier to read?  Isn't that what the Kindle was designed for?  Optimal reader happiness!
> Yes, Pocket and Kindle are a match made in heaven.

This is great -- it's like it's meant to help me read my *RSS feeds* on my *Kindle*.

However, Amazon doesn't particularly want to facilitate you reading **free articles** online, when they're the 
largest online bookstore! Amazon want their users attention and reading time directed towards books.  That Amazon sells.  
Makes sense right?

> Sad face :(
 
### Why don't you just read them on your tablet or smartphone?

But, if you're like me and love the Kindle's anti-glare eInk, then you won't end up reading articles on Pocket 
very often.  However, I don't find Kindle fun to use for extended reading sessions and I just don't use it
as often as I'd like.

I mostly don't use my Kindle very often because the awesome 
[Reauthored Kindle DX cover](http://www.reauthored.com/products/kindle-dx-book-case) that I bought a few years ago 
turned out to be much bigger, bulkier and heavier than I thought.  A case made out of a book would probably work much
better for tablets that are smaller, since the weight of the case was the biggest problem: it was hard to hold it up
for more than 10 minutes.

### So here's my vision for reading articles online:

I sort through my RSS reader and generate a list of articles I want to read, perhaps using a service like Pocket.  When
I found one I want to read, I push a button in the app or in my browser and voila! it's converted to a more 
readable format: ads removed and whatnot.  And then -- and here's the automagic part -- it's sent to my Kindle.

And here's the important part: I should not have to expend a single iota of thought, effort or time in getting them to my
Kindle.  I shouldn't have to break out a PDF converter and a USB cable.  And most importantly: I should not have to 
*even* **think** about how it gets from the web to my Kindle.  I should *just* **know** that it's going to be there
when I have a break to read some articles.

> Fun Fact: did you know Amazon's Kindle DX will **only** transfer files using the USB cable that was included with it.
> Convenient, right?

### A new Caliber of eBooks.

Thankfully, I've just discovered [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/), an app that -- among other great features for 
eBooks -- **watches** *RSS Feeds from the net* and **syncs them** *to your Kindle* on a schedule.  Since Pocket offers 
an RSS feed 

Of course, one drawback of Calibre -- there's a few days of lag between the articles' published date and the date 
they're available to read on your Kindle.  This lag time depends on how often you schedule Calibre to pull down.

### Sounds great! How do I set up Caliber?

1. Create a [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) account and get it set up.
1. Install Pocket's Browser Extension.  
  [Click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj?hl=en) 
  for Chrome's extension.
1. Ensure that your Pocket account does not password protect access to your RSS feed.  Unfortunately, the Python
  library that Calibre uses to fetch the RSS articles will run into an error if you try to use a password in the URL.
1. Note the `Pocket RSS Feed URL`, so you use it in the Calibre application later.
1. [Download](http://calibre-ebook.com/download), install and open Calibre.
1. Press the down arrow beside "Fetch News" and select `Add a custom news source`.
1. Enter a `Recipe Title`, the `Number of Days` to pull down, and the `Maximum Number of Articles` with which to limit 
  the Pocket RSS feed.  Note that the Pocket RSS feed already has a maximum of 25 articles.
1. Enter the `Feed Title`, enter the `Pocket RSS Feed URL`, then click `Add/Update Recipe`.

So reading Pocket articles or artcile

However, I've recently discovered a better way to read those articles.  And it's automated, too.  I actually tried this a few years ago, but it didn't really work out at that time, for some reason.

There's another app called Caliber that 

Well that's great, but I found I just never checked my Pocket account to read those posts.
