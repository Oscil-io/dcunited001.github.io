Anyone have any way to completely ‪#‎Block‬ ‪#‎Facebook‬ on a laptop? it's easy for me to avoid when I can easily set restrictions on when I do and do not access your website. But when it's ever present and all I have to do is hit CMD-T, F, Enter and I'm back on, i tend to waste time, all day every day.
The method needs to fit these conditions:
1) doesn't rely on parental control software
2) doesn't rely on DNS at the WiFi router (in other words i don't want lock down the network, just my laptop)
3) doesn't affect facebook login for other web apps
I used to have an easy way to do this: simply alter the ‪#‎Hosts‬ file to redirect ‪#‎DNS‬ requests from facebook to twitter. I could turn FB on and turn it of at will. But now this doesn't work with Chrome, i think because of how it redirects DNS requests.
Oh and Facebook -- It's so incredibly obnoxious that your business model is dependent on distracting people, keeping them on your website and draining their productivity. For example, FB can tweak it's newsfeed algorithms to advertise your posts heavily, immediately after it detects that your activity on mobile apps and browsers has ceased. Because advertising your posts will more likely result in notifications (that you'll receive on your phone) this means that you are likely to jump right back on FB after you log off. ITS FUCKING OBNOXIOUS.
