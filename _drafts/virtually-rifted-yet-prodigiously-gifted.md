it's really easy to map identical spaces in VR
- think your local coffee shop that has an extra space that's
  identically mapped to another space and because they're identical,
  they can be mapped together across the world
  - this is great, except for the constraint on exact dimensions,
    which imposes problems with availability. That's not hard to get
    around, but this is a good starting point for understand how VR
    and AR experiences can be shared
  - customers can get coffee, food and snacks, then connect across the
    world with virtual and augmented experiences.
  - some of the sensors required for streaming 3D video would be
    expensive, so there may be a need for small businesses to provide
    these early on.
    - yet this sounds a lot like telepresence, which didn't catch on
      in many areas because of the high equipment cost.
    - for a few sets of VR goggles and the computers necessary, it
      might cost between $5,000 and $20,000 to equip a room in 2018,
      but i'm pulling those numbers out of the air
- there's an important point about where the true value in the VR/AR
  industry is. I'm leaving that out, i'll cover it in the article on
  VR/AR business.

#### transformations on identical spaces

in local interactions in a virtual space, objects within that space
can be transformed to appear to each person to morph into a new
object. so, you could transform a pencil into a blowgun and then the
pencil adopts the functionality of that object. or you can turn a book
into a floating platform. this is another reason augmented reality is
so much more interesting than virtual reality.

The objects could either be read into a 3D mesh or already be
recognized. from here, sensors in the room could track these objects
and they will appear transformed into a new object and seen the same
by each person. Or there could be slight variations in appearence
depending on the current experience's rules.

The objects can be read into a 3D mesh and tracked easily. Or the 3D
mesh could already be known additionally, if the objects in them are
mostly identical, then transformations can be applied to them.

This involves a lot of category theory, which can be used to help
define the types of 3D objects a particular object could be
transformed into. So, cup-like objects could be transformed into
things that look or function similar to a cup. A pencil can be
transformed into things shaped similarly to a pencil. If something is
transformed too drastically, then it's motion/action might not appear
natural. This isn't easy by the way, but it presents an interesting
challenge that ... well ... more to come later. This all requires a
ton of energy and computing power.

#### mapping non-identical spaces

this is much more interesting than mapping identical spaces and it
drastically lowers the barrier to a functional virtualized experience
shared across the globe. so if you require identical spaces, that kind
of sucks, doesn't it? what if your coffee shop can't create a space of
just the right dimensions.

(more here)

you can map adjacent rooms in your house to one space to other virtual
rooms
- or you can be in a single room and map these logical transitions to
  other spaces
  - if you've mapped adjacent rooms ...
    - then you can walk from room to room and this triggers a
      transition
      - you can specify which transition with a gesture or something

- VX/AX can be rendered for the space they are presented in
  - this is similar to the 6th layer of OSI model/Responsive CSS

this cuts down on the requirement for rooms of specific geometry
- your applications know how to render things in various geometries in
  some way which is not overly complicated.

- experienced can be shared on non-identical surfaces
  - "you, a friend and your coffee tables"
  - it recognizes that you can load this VX/AX on this flat area of
    your coffee table. or the activity or experience could be loaded
    into other constraints.
    - so in this way, floating apps or activities would have less
      limitations, but these would seem more "real" if they were
      "docked" in relation to some

CSS-like language to determine how these activities bind to their
surfaces or docking points.
- has something similar to media queries which allows these to expand
  their bounds to fit spaces of different sizes





#### multi-room mappings

mapping multiple physical rooms to multiple virtual spaces


it's much more affordable to wire together a single room with a set of
sensors that can enable applications.





#### hyperlinked spaces

whereas the internet was all about hypermedia and hypertext, VR/AR are
all about hyperlinked spaces. or they could be... it's hard to
tell. one thing is certain, there will be continual change in VR/AR as
the tech rolls out. (more in the business article)

so instead of clicking on a space, you just trigger a more complicated
action that transfers you to another virtual space.

- what is the equivalent of the browser for VR/AR?
  - url routing schemes for virtual spaces
- mapping virtual spaces onto physical spaces,
  - either identical and not identical



- hyperlinked spaces
- turning your house into a virtualized environment
- mapping experiences to non-identical spaces




#### sharing virtual experiences

basically loading shared virtual experiences on a table in a coffee
shop or something.

## Part 2: VR Business

UI/UX is voice, gesture & object-functional (better word for this?)
- so these are more realistic interactions


whether or not people choose text over virtual telepresence depends on
how the user interfaces facilitate quick, dynamic interactions
- people have a tendancy to want to limit the signals from
  face-to-face or voice interactions to just text because:
  - there's less anxiety
  - text can be asynchronous


is there a way to make virtual telepresence asynchronous without
overburdening the user with UI/UX
- if so, then users are more likely to use this. or at least the
  effect limiting voice/video usage would be downplayed
  - object/gesture/voice

================

you could either map adjacent rooms in your house
- to adjacent virtual rooms

or you could just be in a single room and just like
- define these logical transitions to virtual spaces

but if you’ve mapped adjacent rooms in your house to other virtual rooms
- you’ll be in one room in your house and you’l like enter like one room in your house,
- you’ll transition into another virtual space that’s rendered for the room you’re stepping into

if you're wearing your goggles and and you’re be like walking through a door
- and you’ve already triggered the application to like
- transition to the next hyperspace or metaspace or whatever you want to call it
- and as you maek that transition in your room,
- it makes that transition to the next hyperspace or whatever

#### 8:00 - 9:20 clear?

and so multiple people can interact in rooms with like completely different geometry
- you don’t like have to have an identical VR room to interact with other people
- so if you have a table .. let’s say you have a coffee table and a couch
- and so does your friend!

then you can sorta sit across from each other
- and bc you both have coffee tables, they might not look alike
- the program recognizes this as a surface that you can kinda put things on
- and it’s like flat and kinda large and it something that you sit in front of
- the program recognizes that you can share an experience on this coffee table
- i mean, it’s really two coffee tables, right?

but it recognizes that you can load this virtual experience
- maybe it’s a game, maybe it’s a visualization of data, you know
- it just recognizes that your coffee table is a good place to put this
- or is a place where thiese activities can be run, or whatever
- maybe it doesn’t need to be constrained like that

9:20 -

as long as the virtual activities can be rendered to fit each person’s room
- or to fit the environment that the user wants to load it on

by the way, if you’re a programmer and you already hate dealing with css media queries
- then you’re probably going to hate dealing with this stuff.
- bc each room in your house will need to be mapped to another room
- and each kind of virtual activity will ahve it’s own requirements
- and will … map to different services and different rooms variously

but it seems like there could be some kind of CSS-like language that adapts these uhh..
- i envision these activities loaded via XML or some kind of markup language
- but these activites might be loaded by some other language altogether.
- but there should be some kind of CSS-like languages that like ….  !$#@!

=============

(10:20)
12:15 -

so enough with the XML and CSS stuff for now
- i’m gonna get back to that in just a second
- but i want to go back to mapping like uh phsical spaces in VR/AR

because like each room in your house is mapped to another virtual room
- you can transition form one virtual room to another
- by just walking into another room in your house
- or you can map virtual spaces to other spaces wihtin a single physical room

so in addition to mapping multiple physical rooms to multiple virtual spaces
- and sharing those virtual spaces amoung non-identical rooms
- you can trnasition form virtual space to virtual space
- by defining certain apertures within a single physical room

so you define an aperture , like an opening.
- where you can liek walk towards this
- and once you walk towards it
- that allows you to use some kind of UI
- taht allows you to decide where you’re going to go next

so, basic example. you just walk towards the aperture

13:50 - 14:30 (??)

so you would like approach this aperture in your physical room
(keep) - that would allow you to sorta warp to virtual spaces
#### and suddenly your movements aren’t like one-to-one with your current space

(cut)
so using these apertures, you could map physical spaces
- to a kind of virtualized hyperspace

(keep, move)
and this is going to be much easier —
- and it’s going to be alot harder to map like multiple physcial rooms
- to VR/AR or whatever

it’d be much easier and much more affordable to map a single space
- to a kind of hyperspace using these kind of apertures
- to transition between different spaces


—— 15:00 - 15:15 (cut)

and as you approach the aperture, you know, graphcis or UI elements
- let you know which spaces you would transition to
- and how you would transition to them

—— 15:15 -   (move)

so like one idea i have in mind for transition users between various spaces
- would be like, you approach the aperture,
- if you turn left, you enter one vr room
- if you turn right, you enter another.
- if you back up, you cancel the interaction

and so like, your like literally
- it would be like you’re approaching the aperture
- and it opens or somthing, maybe it looks liek a brick wall, like secret passageway or something

you approach it, as you turn left, in VR, your movement would accelerate,
- down a spiral stairwell or something
- and you would like find yourself in another virtual space that looks similar

and if instead you turn right, a similar thing would happen
- but you would take another transition and it would send you to a different space

and it would be something sorta like be stuckin the lost woods from zelda
- you could go anywhere, but you could never really leave

## Hardware Market Dynamics

for hardware (especially), software, & platforms
- customer expectations of product
- consumption dynamics (...?)
- customer segmentation & revenue streams
  - whether products are marketable to businesses or just consumers

#### Customer expectations of product

these questions kind of repeated for hardware/software/platforms
- what is a VR product? what is an AR product?
 - what do you need to buy? why?
 - how does a customer know?
- especially in terms of how this is going

## Platform(s) - Market Dynamics


## Software(s) - Market Dynamics



customer expectation at the moment is that your VR goggles are like
some kind of [barely] portable computer monitor with a stereoscopic 3D
display. the danger here is that, if the products change so fast, then
consumer *adoption and satisfaction* suffer greatly. if adoption
suffers, you can't build a sizeable platform, which limits developer
appeal -- they can't monetize.  these apps are going to be expensive!
programming is going to be HARD and require lots of MATH. from what i
know, that's out of reach for many developers.

THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS.... and i'm sure
Google/Apple/Microsoft/Facebook/Oculus have thought of this, but
actually, the system stacks against the consumer and the tech giants
battle it out for the first chunk of market share and completely FUCK
THE MARKET... the thing is? some of these companies have less of an
incentive to embrace VR than others (i'm looking at you facebook and
google) WHY? why don't you fucking ask someone that can answer that
question? oh yeh, that's right, there aren't very many people who
can... (rewrite lulz) alexa can probably answer that question. i'll
answer it if you double my net worth! it'll cost you SIXTY CENTS...
