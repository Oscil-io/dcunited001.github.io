#### mapping identical spaces

it's really easy to map identical spaces in VR
- think your local coffee shop that has an extra space that's
  identically mapped to another space and because they're identical,
  they can be mapped together across the world
  - this is great, except for the constraint on exact dimensions,
    which imposes problems with availability. That's not hard to get
    around, but this is a good starting point for understand how VR
    and AR experiences can be shared
  - customers can get coffee, food and snacks, then connect across the
    world with virtual and augmented experiences.
  - some of the sensors required for streaming 3D video would be
    expensive, so there may be a need for small businesses to provide
    these early on.
    - yet this sounds a lot like telepresence, which didn't catch on
      in many areas because of the high equipment cost.
    - for a few sets of VR goggles and the computers necessary, it
      might cost between $5,000 and $20,000 to equip a room in 2018,
      but i'm pulling those numbers out of the air
- there's an important point about where the true value in the VR/AR
  industry is. I'm leaving that out, i'll cover it in the article on
  VR/AR business.

#### transformations on identical spaces

in local interactions in a virtual space, objects within that space
can be transformed to appear to each person to morph into a new
object. so, you could transform a pencil into a blowgun and then the
pencil adopts the functionality of that object. or you can turn a book
into a floating platform. this is another reason augmented reality is
so much more interesting than virtual reality.

The objects could either be read into a 3D mesh or already be
recognized. from here, sensors in the room could track these objects
and they will appear transformed into a new object and seen the same
by each person. Or there could be slight variations in appearence
depending on the current experience's rules.

The objects can be read into a 3D mesh and tracked easily. Or the 3D
mesh could already be known additionally, if the objects in them are
mostly identical, then transformations can be applied to them.

This involves a lot of category theory, which can be used to help
define the types of 3D objects a particular object could be
transformed into. So, cup-like objects could be transformed into
things that look or function similar to a cup. A pencil can be
transformed into things shaped similarly to a pencil. If something is
transformed too drastically, then it's motion/action might not appear
natural. This isn't easy by the way, but it presents an interesting
challenge that ... well ... more to come later. This all requires a
ton of energy and computing power.

#### mapping non-identical spaces

this is much more interesting than mapping identical spaces and it
drastically lowers the barrier to a functional virtualized experience
shared across the globe. so if you require identical spaces, that kind
of sucks, doesn't it? what if your coffee shop can't create a space of
just the right dimensions.

(more here)

you can map adjacent rooms in your house to one space to other virtual
rooms
- or you can be in a single room and map these logical transitions to
  other spaces
  - if you've mapped adjacent rooms ...
    - then you can walk from room to room and this triggers a
      transition
      - you can specify which transition with a gesture or something

- VX/AX can be rendered for the space they are presented in
  - this is similar to the 6th layer of OSI model/Responsive CSS

this cuts down on the requirement for rooms of specific geometry
- your applications know how to render things in various geometries in
  some way which is not overly complicated.

- experienced can be shared on non-identical surfaces
  - "you, a friend and your coffee tables"
  - it recognizes that you can load this VX/AX on this flat area of
    your coffee table. or the activity or experience could be loaded
    into other constraints.
    - so in this way, floating apps or activities would have less
      limitations, but these would seem more "real" if they were
      "docked" in relation to some

CSS-like language to determine how these activities bind to their
surfaces or docking points.
- has something similar to media queries which allows these to expand
  their bounds to fit spaces of different sizes





#### multi-room mappings

mapping multiple physical rooms to multiple virtual spaces


it's much more affordable to wire together a single room with a set of
sensors that can enable applications.





#### hyperlinked spaces

whereas the internet was all about hypermedia and hypertext, VR/AR are
all about hyperlinked spaces. or they could be... it's hard to
tell. one thing is certain, there will be continual change in VR/AR as
the tech rolls out. (more in the business article)

so instead of clicking on a space, you just trigger a more complicated
action that transfers you to another virtual space.

- what is the equivalent of the browser for VR/AR?
  - url routing schemes for virtual spaces
- mapping virtual spaces onto physical spaces,
  - either identical and not identical



- hyperlinked spaces
- turning your house into a virtualized environment
- mapping experiences to non-identical spaces




#### sharing virtual experiences

basically loading shared virtual experiences on a table in a coffee
shop or something.
- move to another section?


#### examples of virtualized AR experiences

- create a puzzle for you and friends to solve
  - some things are better in real reality though


#### stress advanced math skills

- Linear Algebra
- Category Theory & Algebraic Geometry

## Part 2: VR Business

UI/UX is voice, gesture & object-functional (better word for this?)
- so these are more realistic interactions


whether or not people choose text over virtual telepresence depends on
how the user interfaces facilitate quick, dynamic interactions
- people have a tendancy to want to limit the signals from
  face-to-face or voice interactions to just text because:
  - there's less anxiety
  - text can be asynchronous


is there a way to make virtual telepresence asynchronous without
overburdening the user with UI/UX
- if so, then users are more likely to use this. or at least the
  effect limiting voice/video usage would be downplayed
  - object/gesture/voice

================

you could either map adjacent rooms in your house
- to adjacent virtual rooms

or you could just be in a single room and just like
- define these logical transitions to virtual spaces

but if you’ve mapped adjacent rooms in your house to other virtual rooms
- you’ll be in one room in your house and you’l like enter like one room in your house,
- you’ll transition into another virtual space that’s rendered for the room you’re stepping into

if you're wearing your goggles and and you’re be like walking through a door
- and you’ve already triggered the application to like
- transition to the next hyperspace or metaspace or whatever you want to call it
- and as you maek that transition in your room,
- it makes that transition to the next hyperspace or whatever

#### 8:00 - 9:20 clear?

and so multiple people can interact in rooms with like completely different geometry
- you don’t like have to have an identical VR room to interact with other people
- so if you have a table .. let’s say you have a coffee table and a couch
- and so does your friend!

then you can sorta sit across from each other
- and bc you both have coffee tables, they might not look alike
- the program recognizes this as a surface that you can kinda put things on
- and it’s like flat and kinda large and it something that you sit in front of
- the program recognizes that you can share an experience on this coffee table
- i mean, it’s really two coffee tables, right?

but it recognizes that you can load this virtual experience
- maybe it’s a game, maybe it’s a visualization of data, you know
- it just recognizes that your coffee table is a good place to put this
- or is a place where thiese activities can be run, or whatever
- maybe it doesn’t need to be constrained like that

9:20 -

as long as the virtual activities can be rendered to fit each person’s room
- or to fit the environment that the user wants to load it on

by the way, if you’re a programmer and you already hate dealing with css media queries
- then you’re probably going to hate dealing with this stuff.
- bc each room in your house will need to be mapped to another room
- and each kind of virtual activity will ahve it’s own requirements
- and will … map to different services and different rooms variously

but it seems like there could be some kind of CSS-like language that adapts these uhh..
- i envision these activities loaded via XML or some kind of markup language
- but these activites might be loaded by some other language altogether.
- but there should be some kind of CSS-like languages that like ….  !$#@!

=============

(10:20)
12:15 -

so enough with the XML and CSS stuff for now
- i’m gonna get back to that in just a second
- but i want to go back to mapping like uh phsical spaces in VR/AR

because like each room in your house is mapped to another virtual room
- you can transition form one virtual room to another
- by just walking into another room in your house
- or you can map virtual spaces to other spaces wihtin a single physical room

so in addition to mapping multiple physical rooms to multiple virtual spaces
- and sharing those virtual spaces amoung non-identical rooms
- you can trnasition form virtual space to virtual space
- by defining certain apertures within a single physical room

so you define an aperture , like an opening.
- where you can liek walk towards this
- and once you walk towards it
- that allows you to use some kind of UI
- taht allows you to decide where you’re going to go next

so, basic example. you just walk towards the aperture

13:50 - 14:30 (??)

so you would like approach this aperture in your physical room
(keep) - that would allow you to sorta warp to virtual spaces
#### and suddenly your movements aren’t like one-to-one with your current space

(cut)
so using these apertures, you could map physical spaces
- to a kind of virtualized hyperspace

(keep, move)
and this is going to be much easier —
- and it’s going to be alot harder to map like multiple physcial rooms
- to VR/AR or whatever

it’d be much easier and much more affordable to map a single space
- to a kind of hyperspace using these kind of apertures
- to transition between different spaces


—— 15:00 - 15:15 (cut)

and as you approach the aperture, you know, graphcis or UI elements
- let you know which spaces you would transition to
- and how you would transition to them

—— 15:15 -   (move)

so like one idea i have in mind for transition users between various spaces
- would be like, you approach the aperture,
- if you turn left, you enter one vr room
- if you turn right, you enter another.
- if you back up, you cancel the interaction

and so like, your like literally
- it would be like you’re approaching the aperture
- and it opens or somthing, maybe it looks liek a brick wall, like
  secret passageway or something

you approach it, as you turn left, in VR, your movement would accelerate,
- down a spiral stairwell or something
- and you would like find yourself in another virtual space that looks similar

and if instead you turn right, a similar thing would happen
- but you would take another transition and it would send you to a
  different space

and it would be something sorta like be stuckin the lost woods from zelda
- you could go anywhere, but you could never really leave

# VR/AR: Business & UI (title?)

## App Ideas

- which apps leverage Business/UI aspects?
  - or show how an app today might fail tomorrow because of changes in
    user interactions


#### UI-Driven Economics of Data




#### Hardware Economics

- mention that product/platform complexity will cause VR to suffer serious setbacks
  - if hardware require for apps is vastly different from platform to platform or app to app
    - this becomes incredibly confusing/frustrating/expensive for consumers
    - and drastically increases the cost of software development
- alters demand for other computing products
  -

### What is a VR product? What is an AR product?




## Who are the consumers of a VR/AR product?


###



# Market


## Hardware Market Dynamics

for hardware (especially), software, & platforms
- customer expectations of product
- consumption dynamics (...?)
- customer segmentation & revenue streams
  - whether products are marketable to businesses or just consumers

#### Customer expectations of product

these questions kind of repeated for hardware/software/platforms
- what is a VR product? what is an AR product?
 - what do you need to buy? why?
 - how does a customer know?
- especially in terms of how this is going

## Platform(s) - Market Dynamics


## Software(s) - Market Dynamics



customer expectation at the moment is that your VR goggles are like
some kind of [barely] portable computer monitor with a stereoscopic 3D
display. the danger here is that, if the products change so fast, then
consumer *adoption and satisfaction* suffer greatly. if adoption
suffers, you can't build a sizeable platform, which limits developer
appeal -- they can't monetize.  these apps are going to be expensive!
programming is going to be HARD and require lots of MATH. from what i
know, that's out of reach for many developers.

THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS.... and i'm sure
Google/Apple/Microsoft/Facebook/Oculus have thought of this, but
actually, the system stacks against the consumer and the tech giants
battle it out for the first chunk of market share and completely FUCK
THE MARKET... the thing is? some of these companies have less of an
incentive to embrace VR than others (i'm looking at you facebook and
google) WHY? why don't you fucking ask someone that can answer that
question? oh yeh, that's right, there aren't very many people who
can... (rewrite lulz) alexa can probably answer that question. i'll
answer it if you double my net worth! it'll cost you SIXTY CENTS...



==================================================


## VR/AR: Killer Apps

- VR App: 4D Rubik's Cube
  - seems like a good way to display how to depart from reality

- 4D VR Rubik's Cube w/ Hardware
  - could use OLED screens or LED's to update colors for the fourth
    dimension
  - also, traditional rubik's cube is like a 3D cube with surface
    rotations.
  - there's another possibility 3D cube with segment
    rotations, where each cube on a smaller scale rotates about its
    axis and there's no surface rotations


### VR Psychology/Sociology are Killer Applications for Academia

so... it turns out that VR/AR are fantastic for academia, sociology
and psychology.

#FalseMemory studies: streaming 3D VR overlaying a slightly modified
reality makes 4 good methodology 4psych memory ...

something along these lines would be great for psychology studies on
memory. also, keeping track of the real world with an immersive 3D
virtual world in context is an interesting, but unnatural challenge
for the brain.

e.g. #2 a table in front of someone has 12 red cubes & 3 fake red
cubes that look identical. a robotic arm performs a shell game ... the
interactions with the cubes are identical and the participant must
keep track of which ones are real/fake.  plot twist: the participant
must get a drink of water and remove himself from the setting for a
brief distraction.

e.g. #1 participant is in mostly empty room and must remember the
location of several real items randomly located through the room,
while trying to complete some virtual activity where the real items
are artificially erased from the activity.  this is good because it
could be a VR/AR game with a score and everyone knows games with
scores are quantifiable activities.

furthermore, #quantizable feedback includes #EyeTracking
#Accelerometer data. and also some means of reading #FacialExpressions
and translating them data. facial expressions are like mandatory for
VR. if your VR doesn't read/convey facetracking to apply to an avatar,
then you lost bro. all this data is pattern mineable.

furthur furthermore, #EEG could be attached to an Oculus for more
quantization ... brooooooo!!!  (EEG should probably be ... not
included in VR eughhh)

... yep, it's me and i'm at it again with my "crazy" and "delusional"
and "totally schizophrenic mind" with all my crazy talk of ""quality
of life improving 「ideas」i'm such an asshole, right?

"fucking don't let *that guy* talk ... THAT GUY?! fuck that guy. he's
on a list... probably all of them. always thinking all the time? what
a fucking douchebag. that guy should be #GangsTalk3d with
#StreetTh3ater amirite? People should be payed to positioned
themselves around him in public to inject themselves in his social
space to snip those possible connections..."

Right? people should cash checks for doin' that to US citizens, right?

### Social Aspects

==================================================


Post it notes (original post date?)

- I may have already posted some of this above, but this is directly
  from drafts on post-it notes (of which i snapped pics and shared
  like 6 months ago)

### VR UI

- multiple UI overlays (accessibility & help)
  - e.g. use mostly icons for a browser-like interface, then enable a
    "help overlay" with information and tooltips
  - a laptop with a "mushy" 2D keyboard just feels like you are typing
    and the keyboard interface is entirely virtualized
    - that's a good one, it's new. i just came up with that lulz
- virtualized UI devices w/ AR drawn on top of desk, alongside
  physical hardware (justin mentioned an arduino w/ a keyboard and
  touchscreen alongside hardware)
  - true "desktop virtualization" lulz
  - how does this affect the economics and desirable aspects of
    furnature? j/k ... sorta

- index time spent in a space at a point in virtual space
  - or time spent where users are focused on a particular
    object/image/brand
    - USE FOR POWERING THE ECONOMICS OF VR/AR!!
    - this is how one derives value from VR/AR experiences
  - this is both applicable to: User Interface and Business

- using a checkerboard as a standard surface for apps
  - also, pocket change be used as a standard metric for
    translating and sizing surfaces to be shared amoungst participants
    in so-called "popup" apps (see the similarly titled section)

### VR UX

- 3D camera voxelized model for approximization of surroundings
  - preprocessed in hardware and exposed to GPU as a data stream
  - this voxelized video stream should be context aware (in hardware)
    so that it retains data of surroundings
    - if so, then it can patch together the experience using data
      pieces from street view, etc

- Access UI/UX w/ combinations of getsutres controlling virtualized...

### VR Social

- what is different here? Enough for post?
  - read facial expressions and play games together
  - there is more of a authentic social dimension to VR apps

- VR Experiences have a stunted Social Media Network Effect
  - **this is important for app growth aspects of social VR app**

### VR Misc

- Niantic is SOOOO ahead of the game when it comes to the business
  aspects of VR/AR that it's not even funny.
  - the business models of AR especially are built on offering data as
    a service/convenience for other apps. **IT IS ALL WEB 3.0** (or
    3.5)

### VR/AR changes needed for Software/Hardware

- (#1) really, what is needed is a wireless protocol that exposes GPU
  and compute resources as though they were on the BUS. WE NEED
  WIRELESS BUS SPEEDS!

- GPU/Compute becomes crucial for non-graphical tasks.
  - and must be coordinated, distributed and load-balanced across
    disparate systems
  - while accounting for faults, delays, prioritization
  - THIS DRIVES DEMAIND 4 specific compute architectures
    - which changes market dynamics for tech giants & data-driven
      services (wut economics)

- NDN + MGRS + P2P becomes very useful
  - again, this changes market dynamics for tech giants & data-driven
      services (wut economics)

- For Some ops, 3D objects should be treated as point clouds, AND NOT
  TRIANGLES
- Metal/Vulkan become very useful (WHICH MOST 3D DEV'S DONT UNDERSTAND
  AFAI CAN SEE !@#$ !$#@! $#@! $#@!)
  - so does functional programming because it is more adaptive

- Advanced geometry and pure math becomes a requisite for nearly every
  user application!! (most people do not understand this at all)
  - this causes VR/AR software (and particularly UI/UX) to become
    inaccessible to people with IQ's below 150
- OS & User Interfaces acquire a 3rd dimension
  - and radically depart from existing form and expectation
  - is there a 2.5D user interface paradigm?
    - like a CSS between the 2nd and 3rd dimension
    - this would be much less complicated than a full 3D UI/UX styling
      language
- Huge need for streaming 3D Node Data and optimizing: Bandwidth,
  Time, redundancy
- Radical changes in storage format for 3D nodes in memory
  - memory as in each: RAM, GPU RAM, and permanent storage (network
    accessible, tierably cached)

- After 3D recognition, object data should be caced and locally
  available (this alters the object life cycle for application
  development and there's a huge need for a ton of software
  development around this)
  - system state changes should be predictably anticipated and only
    objects dependent on observed state changes should consume
    resources
    - seemingly minor things like this become crucial to making AR/VR
      humanly accessible and economically viable
    - but these are major software development challenges
  - internal/external "boundaries" of the system should be observed
    - a la thermodynamics: all internal "actors" can be known and the
      set of possible actions minimized
      - what did i mean by this? i think it has something do do with
        application security

- everything that I've written from these post-it notes is at odds
  with secure application development (i think)
  - there are major trade-off's between asymtotically perfect security
    and each of: economic viability, human accessibility,
    configurability, reliability, portability, etc, etc, etc
    - this is a major pain in the ass, especially because of the
      economic viability constraints
    - the economics of any new technology determines how that
      technology unfolds and whether it's truly a next big thing or
      the next big fad
    - the expense of VR/AR hardware is going to be high and consumers
      will get sick of such unnecessary expenses
      - WE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT VR HARDWARE TO SCALE INTO LANDFILLS
        LIKE E.T. CARTRIDGES

### VR/AR Graphics Technology

- VR & AI are intrinsically linked and circularly dependendent for
  development of practical application of either

- e.g. there's a need to infer geometry from streaming video and
  TRANSFORM. to do so in a computationally reasonable manner requires
  contextually-aware & trained AI to recognize objects
- game/etc use case: transform arbitrary 3D space to a specific style
  - transform my house into a medieval castle
  - this requires tons of category theory
    - see notes from the videos i made
- another game/etc idea: object recognition and transformation to
  similary object types via dimensions of
  shape/size/function/handlability
- techniques similar to how the brain reconstructs its visual
  environment (texture/shape/memory sampling to prevent reevaluating
  all sensory data every time)
- model for predicting environment/object/body state changes within
  time t (based on models of understood behaviors and contextually
  inferred object type)
- prediction of visemes from audio for chat avatars (see disney
  patents and research)
- scale-invariant transform for 3D object recogntion
  - while this seems more complicated, actually more dimensions here
    means less total complexity!!
- contact lenses and projection (???)

### VR/AR Hardware

- (#1) HOW TO MAKE AR PORTABLE?!
  - this includes power constraints, which limit almost every IRL
    HUMAN use-case

- compute/geometry/etc is power/compute intensive (doblet startup)
  - how would such a system be architected to minimize constraints?
  - how to culturally shift to the right solution?
    - how to convince people that carrying a product such as a
      hackpack/batteries is culturally "cool" or at least necessary?
      - can you convince men to carry a purse? why or why not? a
        hackpack is basically a giant purse LMAO
    - how to convince businesses that investing in AR infrastructure
      is valuable?

- in Portable AR, where should the burden of compute lay?
  - on the consumer end? then battery life, cost, convenience
    negatively affects the service usage, adoption, dependability
  - on the service provider? consumer still has a high cost
  - IMO, some of the compute burden should lay with the location the
    consumer is visiting, who provides the apps they use.
    - but this is hard to finance for small businesses & businesses
      outside of culturally advanced areas (san francisco)

- VR/AR Hardware needs to optimize on:
  - MAXIMIZING: modularity, operation time, compute capability
  - MINIMIZING: xmission signal, configuration, compute dependency

### VR/AR Networking & Platform Technology

- AR capable mobile devices need:
  - 2+ cams (on each side! or reversable camera)
  - 2+ mics which are integrated in hardware for positionality
    - but, for which, each microphone can be exposed through OS API's
      individually, if necessary
      - apps that depend on individual mics would then need to be able
        to expect a customary hardware formfactor
    - the emphasis here is on spatial reconstruction and detection of
      directionality
  - also, the devices need 2 OR MORE WIFI DEVICES!
    - why? for genericized peer-to-peer behavior
    - wifi actually isn't the proper hardware protocol for this, since
      such peer-to-peer networks can only be on channels 1,6, or 11
      and too susceptible to interference
    - but the point is to have network channels for peer-to-peer
      behavior and for traditional WAN access
      - the ad-hoc, generalized peer-to-peer is crucial for
        introducing data streams for context-sharing, etc between end
        users

- NDN & P2P ad-hoc networking + MGRS (GPS)
  - to provide tech basis for apps present with no configuration
  - that is, MGRS provides indexing for GPS-specific applications that
    "live" in specific areas

- protocols to stream and configure streams to multiplex
  - sensory/graphics data becomes distributed, as needed
    - major software challenges here
  - merge sensory data from multiple systems to make inferences from
    shared environment
  - heterogenous distribution of compute (& the applicable generic
    software interface)
    - this heterogenous distribution of compute should be for physics,
      graphics, and geometry tasks
- dynamic def/composition of graphics/physics/compute/geometry
  pipelines
  - THIS IS WHY THE IDEAS FOR SPECTRA IS IMPORTANT
    - spectra is the functional graphics library for iOS/Metal
  - what are the ideal protocols and network architectures to
    distribute?
- interfaces for hardware/system/platform interoperability

- protocol to stream sensory data in a unified way
  - a 3D streaming format that combines input from various devices
    (IR, UV, Vis3D Camera, Ultrasound)
  - differential, like MPEG
    - but dimensionally so?
    - does information compression become more or less complex as the
      number of dimensions increases?
      - less complex and more effective, right?
      - OOPS THAT'S PATENTABLE (?)

### VR/AR Business

- (#1) where is the VALUE for consumers and service providers
  - and how should that value be marketed?
  - and, in the actual realistic progression of technology, how does
    the value reach the consumer? like what value opportunities become
    actualized as the technology progresses
- (#2) how should AR be architected to
  - MAXIMIZE: satisfaction, reliability, modularity, economic
    viability, and service utilization?
  - while MINIMIZING: obsolescence, obtrusive
    configuration/interfaces, time-to-market, configuration overhead,
    proprietary constraints and points/risk of failure?

- again, with even more emphasis on these attributes: how can VR/AR be
  strategically planned to:
  - MAXIMIZE: rate of adoption, consumer satisfaction, usefulness,
    reliability, modularity, value, modularity (again), platform
    interoperability, simplicity (for consumer & app developers)
  - MINIMIZE: obsolescence, configuration overhead, leaerning curve,
    COST, consumer interface complexity, proprietary constraints,
    number of points of failure, turbulence in market & platform dynamics
- potential for obsolence and turbulent dynamics (for market &
  platform) ... both of these will lead to major consumer/business
  frustration/confusion
- how can these factors be optimized FOR THE CONSUMER?
  - and secondarily: for the developers of economic opportunities
    based on VR/AR, so that the economic opportunities pursued are
    stable and provide real, well distributed economic value
  - how will these factors change during AR rollout and platform
    maturation? how do they affect consumer/business satisfaction
  - how will web 2.0/2.5 startups/businesses adapt to these new
    platforms?

- what are the legal implications (for privacy/security)
- what are the economics of 3D video?
  - how long until it's truly in the hands of consumers?
  - cost per feature?
  - market mechanics of quality and content distribution?
  - constraints for space (GB) and bandwidth and compression?
  - processing/software?
  - adaptation of existing content to platform specifics?

- since many(i.e. MOST) AR/VR apps are built on existing IP (patents)
  then there is a much higher demand for IP knowledge and
  credentialled representation
  - i.e. everyone is going to need to pay out more for IP-protection,
    licensing and representation

- what are the specific economic dynamics for each geographic market
  for VR/AR development
  - that is, the viable platforms and viable economic opportunities
    for each market will be different based on the purchasing power,
    existing hardware portfolios, etc. of consumers in that market
  - so, therefore, the rollout for each market will differ in major
    and minor ways.

### VR Apps

- (#1) What is the protoypical app for VR/AR?
  - i.e. what is the Twitter or Super Mario Brothers of VR/AR?
  - how do these prototypical applications change at each stage of
    platform/hardware evolution?
  - prototypical app ~~ "Killer App"

- (#2) Where is the money in VR/AR?
  - what is profitable?
  - what is monetizeable?
  - where is the perceived value for consumers?
  - how does hardware compatibility affect this?
    - service reliability? cost?
    - there are SO MANY ZERO-MULTIPLYING FACTORS
      - i.e. there are so many factors in the VR/AR economics that can
        nearly zero out the value for consumers
      - where v(...) is consumer value:
        - v(a,b,c,...) = (a x b + c x d x e) x (a x b x c)
  - how do operating systems affect the ecosystems?
    - what are the VR/AR hardware "ecosystem" equivalents of an
      operating system?
    - how would API's be developed on top of these "platform systems"

- VR Hair Style Preview
- VR/AR Photo Booth app
  - THIS IS A KILLER APP
  - and it has a well-monetizable business model too
  - think new-era instagram/snapchat
- 3D-camera based filters for snapchat
- VR/AR MUD (multi user dungeon)
  - a la text-based, but with 3D space
- VR/AR DnD
  - object recognition for the basics
  - transform room geometry
  - avatars replace players
  - AR Gameboard
  - I'm sure hundreds have thought of this, but it seems to have
    infinite potential for VR/AR.
    - this might even be one of those prototypical apps
- VR/AR chat apps (with avatars)
- VR/AR live theater 3D video broadcasts
  - twitch or youtube are perfectly positioned to monetize on things
    like this (eventually)
- VR/AR Magic: The Gathering & card games & board games
  - how to "platform-genericize" such games
    - so that board games can be sold in brick-and-mortar stores,
      without burdening the consumer with needing to understand the
      details of hardware/software/OS requirements
- one-on-one instruction (piano lessons, tutoring)
- web 3.0/3.5 apps (data-driven business models)
  - the viability/demand that powers the microeconomics of these
    fluctuates
- AR Mirroring App (faceswapping)
- Speechcraft & simulation apps
- VR/AR out-of-body experiences
- virtual movie theaters (with a social component)
- speechcraft simulation app
  - give a speech in front of a simulated audience
    - with simulated reactions based on your performance
- teleprompter app
- VR/AR medical imagery app
  - doctor views the simulated/replicated imagery on top of patient
- 3D printed "avatars" for AR Apps

- VR/AR smartwatch
- "virtuo-somatic" apps
  - these involve your body (like a virtual smartwatch)

- AR kindle app
  - share the cover for the book you are reading on a kindle to other
    people in a coffee shop who are on the same VR/AR platform as you

### VR "Popup Games"

- these "are" played on a generic table-like surface
  - in the future, that is...

- the surface needs to be metrically translated amoung participants
  - so this can be marked with a checkerboard or with pocketchange
  - doing so requires sharing data amounc participants and portable AR
    hardware

- 3D Zelda-like AR Dungeon Crawler, inlaid into a surface
  - the "killer-app" here isn't an app: it's the platform for
    games/apps based on this table-top app popup paradigm

- 2.5D Super-Mario maker
  - with either a Super Mario RPG set up
    - or a 2.5D or 3D mario game setup
- Popup card games
  - with possibly augmented rulesets
    - rules specific to capabilities provided by AR
  - think about playing "asshole" with friends using AR-specific
    rulesets

- 4D game (braid?) w/ AR/VR
  - can be popup or not
  - these kind of experiences are my fave

- focus on the multiplayer experience
