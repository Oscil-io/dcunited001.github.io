- briefly explain videos 5 & 6 from
  [why you should give me a billion dollars]()
  - [vid 5]()
  - [vid 6]()

vr blind dates app
- kinda like chat roulette or airtime for VR
  - you pop in and out of quick 5 minute interactions with other
    people

#### mapping identical spaces

it's really easy to map identical spaces in VR
- think your local coffee shop that has an extra space that's
  identically mapped to another space


- hyperlinked spaces
- turning your house into a virtualized environment
- mapping non-identical spaces


#### sharing virtual experiences


#### transformations on identical spaces


#### specific examples of transformations


#### examples of virtualized AR experiences

VR/AR User Interfaces, Mapping Spaces and Date Roulette

- url routing schemes for virtual spaces
- mapping virtual spaces onto physical spaces,
  - either identical and not identical

In this series, "Why You Should Give Me A Billion Dollars," I detail
hundreds of profitable ideas that would revolutionize VR/AR,
Biotechnology, Artificial Intelligence, Music and more.


### part6 snippet: ~3:20 - ~5:00


0:00 - 1:45 (clean)
- intro
- vr blind dates

1:45 - 3:00 (clean)

3:00 - 4:00

4:00 - 6:00

6:00 - 7:00

7:00 - 8:00 (all clean)

you could either map adjacent rooms in your house
- to adjacent virtual rooms

or you could just be in a single room and just like
- define these logical transitions to virtual spaces

but if you’ve mapped adjacent rooms in your house to other virtual rooms
- you’ll be in one room in your house and you’l like enter like one room in your house,
- you’ll transition into another virtual space that’s rendered for the room you’re stepping into

if you're wearing your goggles and and you’re be like walking through a door
- and you’ve already triggered the application to like
- transition to the next hyperspace or metaspace or whatever you want to call it
- and as you maek that transition in your room,
- it makes that transition to the next hyperspace or whatever

#### 8:00 - 9:20 clear?

and so multiple people can interact in rooms with like completely different geometry
- you don’t like have to have an identical VR room to interact with other people
- so if you have a table .. let’s say you have a coffee table and a couch
- and so does your friend!

then you can sorta sit across from each other
- and bc you both have coffee tables, they might not look alike
- the program recognizes this as a surface that you can kinda put things on
- and it’s like flat and kinda large and it something that you sit in front of
- the program recognizes that you can share an experience on this coffee table
- i mean, it’s really two coffee tables, right?

but it recognizes that you can load this virtual experience
- maybe it’s a game, maybe it’s a visualization of data, you know
- it just recognizes that your coffee table is a good place to put this
- or is a place where thiese activities can be run, or whatever
- maybe it doesn’t need to be constrained like that

9:20 -

as long as the virtual activities can be rendered to fit each person’s room
- or to fit the environment that the user wants to load it on

by the way, if you’re a programmer and you already hate dealing with css media queries
- then you’re probably going to hate dealing with this stuff.
- bc each room in your house will need to be mapped to another room
- and each kind of virtual activity will ahve it’s own requirements
- and will … map to different services and different rooms variously

but it seems like there could be some kind of CSS-like language that adapts these uhh..
- i envision these activities loaded via XML or some kind of markup language
- but these activites might be loaded by some other language altogether.
- but there should be some kind of CSS-like languages that like ….  !$#@!

=============

(10:20)
12:15 -

so enough with the XML and CSS stuff for now
- i’m gonna get back to that in just a second
- but i want to go back to mapping like uh phsical spaces in VR/AR

because like each room in your house is mapped to another virtual room
- you can transition form one virtual room to another
- by just walking into another room in your house
- or you can map virtual spaces to other spaces wihtin a single physical room

so in addition to mapping multiple physical rooms to multiple virtual spaces
- and sharing those virtual spaces amoung non-identical rooms
- you can trnasition form virtual space to virtual space
- by defining certain apertures within a single physical room

so you define an aperture , like an opening.
- where you can liek walk towards this
- and once you walk towards it
- that allows you to use some kind of UI
- taht allows you to decide where you’re going to go next

so, basic example. you just walk towards the aperture

13:50 - 14:30 (??)

so you would like approach this aperture in your physical room
(keep) - that would allow you to sorta warp to virtual spaces
#### and suddenly your movements aren’t like one-to-one with your current space

(cut)
so using these apertures, you could map physical spaces
- to a kind of virtualized hyperspace

(keep, move)
and this is going to be much easier —
- and it’s going to be alot harder to map like multiple physcial rooms
- to VR/AR or whatever

it’d be much easier and much more affordable to map a single space
- to a kind of hyperspace using these kind of apertures
- to transition between different spaces


—— 15:00 - 15:15 (cut)

and as you approach the aperture, you know, graphcis or UI elements
- let you know which spaces you would transition to
- and how you would transition to them

—— 15:15 -   (move)

so like one idea i have in mind for transition users between various spaces
- would be like, you approach the aperture,
- if you turn left, you enter one vr room
- if you turn right, you enter another.
- if you back up, you cancel the interaction

and so like, your like literally
- it would be like you’re approaching the aperture
- and it opens or somthing, maybe it looks liek a brick wall, like secret passageway or something

you approach it, as you turn left, in VR, your movement would accelerate,
- down a spiral stairwell or something
- and you would like find yourself in another virtual space that looks similar

and if instead you turn right, a similar thing would happen
- but you would take another transition and it would send you to a different space

and it would be something sorta like be stuckin the lost woods from zelda
- you could go anywhere, but you could never really leave
