Ancient Proto Harrapan

- (Pseudohistory)
- So they had to disappear, but they knew if we could find our
  history, we would stop looking.
  - They had achieved something great & powerful & learned all
    languages and created some impressive, but basic technology
  - yet it was too early (overpopulation crises are doomed when it's
    the world is controlled by a monoculture) and thus they knew that
    they had to split this knowledge in to pieces and disappear
  - from here, they became the first civilization to disappear and did
    so intentionally, with the idea that they were retreating into
    cultural fragments that would be distributed across the world and
    into the astral plane to be reunited at a later time

"premodernism" where the set of ideas is so generally limited, that
almost any development is new to any society.
- it's like a state of postmodernism to modernism but occuring before
  ... kinda but not really
  - these two concepts are always in flux, but modernism is known as
    the movement that occurred for art/culture as globalism
    accelerated
- premodernism is a state where there is such a small number of ideas
  and concepts that any addition of a new idea will significant
  - ideas are so limited that we would lack the ability to
    methodically combinate ideas to search for new ones or even the
    idea that we should!
    - for example we might lack the ability to understand that we
      should search our environment for plants that have medical
      application or test different formulations & preperation methods
      for plant-based medicine
      - but more importantly, we might lack the understanding that we
        should do this and we should approach it in a methodical way
      - because the number if ideas is so limited that people just
        didn't have these thoughts yet, since they require such higher
        level abstraction to be approached in a methodical manner
  - another example is with metallurgy & chemistry: discovering new
    processes means reevaluating all known processes to see if a new
    process can expand your understanding
    - but here, you have to know to reevaluate previous knowledge
  - these ideas are less important now, especially given that we
    already know everything (pretty much)
    - and once we actually do know everything about science, then we
      really will lose touch with this.
- there is some critical mass point with premodernism that enables our
  abstraction faculties to .... . . . rise above our environment? how
  to finish this thought?

- premodernist's desire to experiment with cultural elements encoded
  with myth

For the ancients, there were varying degrees of permanence in the
world. The most permanent features of their world were the stars. Most
of them. Some of them moved, predictably.
- other permanent features were mountains and geographical features,
  but some of those moved too, over the course of different time
  scales
  - to them, they might wonder who created them and the world as well
  - they likely understood some geological processes better than we
    think. IMO, Lakota and other peoples probably understood the
    process of erosion, especially with regard to the Grand
    Canyon. this might give them a better idea of the age of the earth
    - mostly speculation
- But, while the stars and mountains were permanent, life was not. So
  this contrast of permanence was a problem .... (reword)
  - However, Architecture may have represented their first ability to
    create something that would outlast death.
    - Did people truly understand death and mortality before
      architecture?
      - How did myths change once we had basic architecture & masonry?
    - In outlasting death and in the ability to rework from what was
      produced by the creator, architecture may have symbolized a
      power over God or a power over God's work.
      - those two views have diverging predicates and implications on
        the role of the Creator or God
- death of a culture. architecture as a symbol of cultural legacy.

- why did they choose their system of names?
  - how did this evolve? what was first? was any one thing first?
  - why did people think to name themselves after names of things in
    the world?
    - this leads to a lower level of differentiation in terms of the
      number of possible names.
      - fewer names means there's a higher chance for people in
        various generations or the same generation to have the same
        name.
      - a lower level of differentiation in a naming system based on
        the world around us means the symbolic meaning of those names
        is more clearly defined.
- the question: "do all David's act beloved?" is more relevant and the
  answer is more interesting in a system with a more restricted set of
  names.
  - "a person's name is the sweetest sound they can hear" is
    interesting when combined with the fact that european names are
    quite often based on biblical figures.
  - this also leads to a more clearly maintained origin of meaning for
    that system of names.
    - David. Saul. Paul. Benjamin. John ... wait which John?
- names have meaning. different systems of naming people have
  different range and delineation of meaning.

this is about how ideas about fragmented language/culture in the
series 5000bc relate to reincarnation.
- there are some ideas in here i'm not sure i should publish, as they
  may relate to protected esoteric ideas of some religions...

- furthermore they structured cultural information and language across
  cultures in order to prove/disprove reincarnation
  - if reincarnation was real and people retained some of their
    identity or reconnected with some part of their past lives,
    - then if information/experience was passed from one generation to
      the next, it would more clearly show up if info & language was
      fragmented (and especially language)
  - e.g. if someone had memories of living in an region that spoke
    sanskrit or an eastern european language or an italian language
    and then they were reborn in japan or china or oceana
    - AND they retained remnants of their experience that were more
      pronounced in childhood, then they would mistakenly find
      themselves displaying specific errors of speech.
      - obviously stuff like this could be easily misinterpreted
      - and regardless of whether reincarnation is real, people have
        always been mapped to the same universal set of semantics &
        metaphysical concepts. connections that are merely incidental
        could be displayed because of these mappings we form
  - anyways.. these differences would be more pronounced *earlier* in
    civilization, as we first started developing technology and
    culture because people would have less lives to live with such
    tech & culture (if they were reborn across the world in a
    statistically uniform way)
    - and so if there was a universal culture early on that had the
      ability to execute on the "The Plan" that I mentioned above,
      then they would be better prepared to detect these kinds of
      inter-incarnational signs if they used cultural & linguistic
      engineering to geographically distribute linguistic features so
      that diversity & regional variance was maximized.. !!!
  - ideas like this are few and far between today because we are so
    completely distracted by technology, social institutaions, social
    stratification, projected individuality, mental illness, and the
    near infinite expanse of the noosphere that:
    - (1) we just never get to these thoughts. we never "get there," in
      that there are too many other entertaining or worrying or
      distracting things to think about
    - (2) we don't have the time or resources or attention or desire
      to spend enough energy thinking about the right things
    - (3) our cultural artifacts are so diverse that we can't sift
      through them to find the original patterns our ancestors picked
      up on.
      - language and culture were much simpler towards the beginning
        of written language.
      - having significantly less of this (like 1/1,000,000th) makes
        it much more likely that a few people could piece it all
        together
  - the blueprints for "The Plan" form a kind of metaphysical map that
    would allow us to hack reality by preserving intergenerational
    knowledge
    - beyond just that of written language and literature
    - if reincarnation exists AND if those people could be located
  - and by doing the following (some of this would occur incidentally
    to some degree, but *could* be engineered to optimize the
    indexability & persistence of information)
    - (1) fragmenting language and cultural elements,
    - (2) persisting execution of "The Plan" and its impact through generations,
    - (3) planning the evolution of language/culture such that the
      information encoded on "The Map" can almost be "indexed"
      geographically. or along other dimensions.
      - this map is analogous to the "Akashic Records", stored on the
        "Astral Plane"
        - in the way i see these "Akashic Records" they are kind of
          like a transgenerational collective consciousness (and/or
          collective unconsciousness)
          - by inhibiting vectors for transgenerational propagation of
            information (i.e. religious/state/educational
            institutions, literature, etc)
            - dark & ignorant forces can subtly dismantle and dissolve
              our means of accessing this (or at least make it a bit
              harder to figure it all out)
            - if zero people remember something and no one wrote it
              down, it can be significantly harder to access it again
              - not necessarily impossible .... but
    - (4) and propgating that subset of information that allows one to
      know/read the "Map" (think waterworld, LOL)
    - (5) encoding information -- "The Key" -- about how to read the
      map into various cultural elements embedded into different
      cultures.
      - this Key can be assembled with different parts based on
        the culture/myth/language/etc was used to create that instance
        of The Key.
        - so many of these same symbols (think semiotics, etc)
          wouldn't be relevant as a "key" to people outside that
          culture.
        - using category theory and multiple layers of indirection and
          abstraction, multiple instances of The Key can designed for
          a specific fragment/shard/branch of the Map & Akashic
          Records.
          - That instance of the key may provide enough information &
            meta information to allow someone to access information
            stored on other shards of the Akashic Records.
            - not all of the information in our collective
      - this information is sometimes embedded into mythology
        - not necessarily intentionally as part of a cohesive, ancient
          proto-globalist plan.  but, because the insights developed by
          ancient religion can be so similar as we are all expounding
          on many of the same mysteries and problems, this "encoding"
          can be incidental
  - this information allows spiritually developed persons from
      each culture to access the "Astral Plane," provided they:
    - know of the plane
    - understand its true nature (which is usually obfuscated
      through esotericism)
    - they understand enough about history, culture and language
      to understand how information in "The Map" can be indexed to
      cultural elements in the real world. (and if they can trace
      the evolution of that index, that helps to understand
      the relevance)
    - they understand how to recognize "astrally" significant
      events in the world and distinguish them from merely
      incidental events
    - they've expounded the knowledge required to access indexed
      elements and map them to real world events, phenomena, etc.
  - if an individual can do these things, then they can "unfold"
    the information stored in the "Astral Plane"

- then: one can basically access information on something like the
  - this astral plane can be indexed geographically
    -  ..... (other 'dimensional' 'indexes')

- analogy to collective consciousness/unconsciousness (CC/CU)
  - difference between space & negative space in art
    - "objects" and "structures" in the CU aren't really "there"
      in the same way that they are for the CC.
      - the CU are like structures that emerge from indirect human
        behavior. e.g. responses to disaster, war, personal trauma,
        tyranny, government institutions, etc.
        - i describe the reaction to the flood(s) in ~5000 B.C.
        - "the" flood (and/or worldwide disaster) and the response to
          it became an archetype in the collective unconcsious of
          humanity. and it's a structure/memory that we haven't lost
          for at least 5,000
        - even though IMO, there were many floods from 15,000
          B.C. through 5,000 B.C. because ice was melting everywhere
        - and these events were so catastrophic that they congealed
          into one mythical "Great Flood" event in the realm of the
          CU... and the CC, actually.  both of them.
    - they don't really have the same relationship in that the CU
      can't be obtained by looking at the inverse image of the CC
      - or looking for emergent images formed from shapes/symbols in
        the CC

- after a major cataclysm like a Great Flood, so many people
  unexpectedly disappear at once that much of the accumulated cultural
  info & memories disappear, along with the CC.
  - furthermore, this information becomes irrelevant afterwards,
    - much of the relevance of cultural information at that time was
      likely based on family, group & tribal relationships.
    - if you're tribe loses 97% of the population and you can't even
      locate other survivors outside your tribe or whatever,
      that cultural information both gains and loses relevance
      - there's a desire to preserve it in the future,
      - but it loses relevance because it's based on endpoints in a
        tightly coupled social network where all the endpoints have
        disappeared.
    - because the info becomes less relevant, there's little interest
      in perpetuating much of the trivial info. and there's a huge
      incentive to fill that void with an imagined history of tribal
      memory, especially if there aren't many people left to
      contradict it.
      - this easily be used to gain a position of power after a disaster
        in earlier human history.
    - disasters on this scale greatly affected the information economy
      in pre-history.  the demand for different types of information
      dramatically changed and the supply was greatly limited.
      - the need for communication networks between widely separated
        groups of people became more apparent.
        - after something like this, people would want to know how
          widespread the damage was. they would be very interested in
          finding out what happened to other groups of people
      - it became clear that some information was more important than
        the rest.
        - information about survival or being resilient to events like
          this.
        - or being safe from them. or finding a place to settle where
          there was limited risk.
        - or "protocols" about meeting locations where, in case of
          another disaster, people could meet other survivors.
          - these could be preserved through myth
      - much of this wasn't at the conscious level. people didn't sit
        around and ponder these questions, per se. it was moreso the
        outcome of their reaction to events like this.
