# Blog Ideas:

## The Basics & Why It's Personally Relevant

- particle physics crossed with graph theory
  - with biophysics-like state-machines, with idealized particles and
    less-complex physical state

## A Typology of Occupations



## Discussion of Schematic Complexity

- complexity of information crossed with type theory
- social physics simulations are rooted in particle physics w/ shared
  fields -
  - the interactions in the physical space are dependent on n-D
    primary virtual space(s)
    - as well as combinatorially enumerated secondary virtual spaces
      which emerge
  - these virtual spaces can be parameterized with continuous or
    discrete variables
    - from which all the classic types of topological spaces emerge
- on the other end, the physical spaces (the "real" spaces) can
  provide for various particle behaviors and behavior types -
- this is the most complex intersection of infinities in every way I
  can conceive -
- it's the most complext application of applied pure math that I have
  yet imagined
  - but social physics is all mostly based on work done in the 19th
    century
- and yet, we all navigate this mathematically intractible maze with
  the same 3-pound slab of smart-meat
  - some of us are profoundly terrible at it.
  - a few operate methodically, including both sociopaths and empaths,
    balancing opportunity cost to empower themselves or others
  - Most of us meerkats are as adept as our range and sum of
    experience. This category operates socially without significant
    conscious effort, which implies several:
    - (1) They have one to five prior years of constant/regular social
      experience with few total or involuntary interruptions,
      regardless of whether it's positive or negative
    - (2) They have a wide variety of types of experiences
    - (3) They have a strong degree of choice in social experience,
      which requires and produces social independence
    - (2) They haven't been unhappy in their lives long enough to wonder
      why they can't get it together.
    - (3) When they have the kinds of problems almost everyone does,
      they have enough of the right social capital or psychological
      flexibility to adjust before they become socially isolated or
      financially disabled.



- most of us lack a rigid framework: we subconsciously operate
  emotionally-driven and neurally-connected statistical models
    - basically cross graph theory, markov models & state machines
    - behavior and state-changes driven by:
      - (1) rules whose rigidity ranges from diamond to steel to paper
      or plastic.
      - (2) information, confidence of information, distribution of
        information
      - (3) individual and collective objectives, needs, wants,
        resources and options

- social isolation can be measured, given some "normal" facebook
  user's 2-degree graph of friends for some definition of normal
  (casual but regular) social media usage
  - filter the friends by strength of connection to indentify edges
    sending and receiving inbound and outbound messages/interactions
    - measure the degree of reciprication and the variety of people
      forming the strongest recent connections
    - filter out all connections which do not fit some minimum of
      interaction threshold
    - this sparsifies the graph, filtering a dense graph and leaving
      only the most relevant connections
  - from here, the person's isolation can be measured using spectral
    graph theory
    - this independence can be measured in graph theory with
      kelman's transformation
    - see spectral graph theory
      [here](http://www.cs.elte.hu/~csiki/application_Kelmans.pdf)
      and [here](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~mtait/k-independent.pdf)

- this, of course, assumes the person is a "normal" facebook user,
  where the relevant 1-degree and 2-degree connections in the friend
  graph are all also "normal" users
  - this high-level algorithm could also work with clustered types of
    facebook users
    - yet, the degree in variation in how people use applications to
      communicate and their distribution of time/usage across multiple
      applications makes clustering extremely difficult.
    - at least, if a clustering algorithm is to enable the selection
      of users which fit some basis with quantifyable variation and
      some metric of confidence


# Simulation Ideas

- cocktail party simulation
  - 100-1000 particles form molecule "conversations"
  - two fields and simple particle physics determine particle movement
  - no exchange of information

- bar simulation
  - build on cocktail party simulation
  - particles are of a single type
  - variations: add money, add gender

- marijuana dealing simulation
  -


- 100 simple particles, each with a dictionary of 100 english nouns
  mapped to integers

  - each time a connection is forged, they exchange:
    - their copy of that dictionary
  - connected via graph constructed by delauney triangulation
