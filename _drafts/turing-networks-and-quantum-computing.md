Imagine your standard Turing Machine, but something a bit
different. Instead of maintaining program state in the a tape with
discretized values, this Turing Network instead processes waveforms
where state can be encoded in various ways, including in spectral
transformations. And this is a network, not a simple machine, where
state is distributed amongst various autonomous Turing Machines.

#### Your Standard Turing Machine Animation

![A Turing Machine]()

#### A Turing Network?

Where did this idea come from? From reading papers on the smart-grid
and imagining self-healing smart-grid infrastructure.

### Why Does The Turing Network Matter?

It's a generalization of a problem that seems relevant to quantum
computing, where state is entangled amongst otherwise autonomous
processes.

The traits distinguishing this hypothetical programming problem
from a simple Turing Machine are:

#### (1) There is a network or graph of devices: a Turing Network

#### (2) They are connected together signaling using only electronic waveforms, so the speed of transfer of information is optionally relevant

#### (3) the electronic components and signaling used are optionally relevant, but should only be considered relevant by masochists.

#### (4) optionally add to each node a quantum FTL networking connection that surpasses the speed of light

So you have a network of variously connected devices sharing the
distribution of a waveforms between various electric channels. Again,
the tape in this Turing Machine is the waveform, which the nodes of
the network are programmed to modify.

The programs in this case are the behaviors of each node in response
to inbound data from a waveform, which modify it and retransmit it
along outbound edges to other nodes. The timing/positioning of the
nodes on the electric network matter.

    - like any Turing program, the values encoded onto the tape depend
      on how the program processes values previously read into the
      program
  - the question posed for such a setup is: how hard is it to get the
    assumptions from Turing Machines to hold for a Turing Network?
- i think, generally, this Turing Network problem is mostly
  irrelevant, but an incredibly useful thought experiement for people
  who want to work on the Smart Grid
  - this is because the smart grid requires distributing state across
    millions of devices to coordinate concerted network behavior to
    distribute power and accurately collect analytics.

- extend "Turing Network" idea to the idea of a probabilistic, genomic
  program, but one where the nature of it's space is
  different. instead of traditional cartesian space, one is operating
  in a space built on top of a graph.
  - this turing network would adopt modes of state changes that behave
    similarly to the idea of ergodic precipitation of metastates that
    arise in dynamical state machines, but again, its space is
    fundamentally different. it's not cartesian and instead uses
    functional analysis to drive domains for functions that are based
    on balls/cuts in the neighborhood of the graph.
  - in this case, the "rules" of the program that determine behavior
    are closely linked the the spatial fabric of the graph of
    connected nodes.
  - this formulation of programming, the "Turing Network" is closely
    linked to quantum computing and would be an interesting analog to
    a Turing Machine for quantum computing.


and you begin to appreciate how quantum networking simplifies the problem of
 coordinating autonomous processes.
