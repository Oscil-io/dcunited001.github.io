- sidetrek: Turing Machine using waveform as data/memory in a turing
  network of electronic devices.
  - in other words, you have a network of variously connected devices
    sharing the distribution of a waveform between electric
    channels. and the "tape" in this Turing Machine is the waveform,
    which the nodes of the network are programmed to modify.
    - the "programs" in this case are the behaviors of each node in
      response to inbound data from a waveform, which modify it and
      retransmit it along outbound edges to other nodes. the
      timing/positioning of the nodes on the electric network matters.
    - like any Turing program, the values encoded onto the tape depend
      on how the program processes values previously read into the
      program
    - the traits distinguishing this hypothetical programming problem
      from a simple Turing Machine are that (1) there is a network of
      devices; a Turing Network (2) they are connected together using
      only electronic waveforms, so the speed of transfer of
      information is optionally relevant (3) the components used are
      optionally relevant, but should only be considered relevant by
      masochists. (4) optionally add to each node a digital networking
      connection that surpasses the speed of light and you begin to
      appreciate how quantum networking simplifies this problem.
  - the question posed for such a setup is: how hard is it to get the
    assumptions from Turing Machines to hold for a Turing Network?
- i think, generally, this Turing Network problem is mostly
  irrelevant, but an incredibly useful thought experiement for people
  who want to work on the Smart Grid
  - this is because the smart grid requires distributing state across
    millions of devices to coordinate concerted network behavior to
    distribute power and accurately collect analytics.

- extend "Turing Network" idea to the idea of a probabilistic, genomic
  program, but one where the nature of it's space is
  different. instead of traditional cartesian space, one is operating
  in a space built on top of a graph.
  - this turing network would adopt modes of state changes that behave
    similarly to the idea of ergodic precipitation of metastates that
    arise in dynamical state machines, but again, its space is
    fundamentally different. it's not cartesian and instead uses
    functional analysis to drive domains for functions that are based
    on balls/cuts in the neighborhood of the graph.
  - in this case, the "rules" of the program that determine behavior
    are closely linked the the spatial fabric of the graph of
    connected nodes.
  - this formulation of programming, the "Turing Network" is closely
    linked to quantum computing and would be an interesting analog to
    a Turing Machine for quantum computing.
