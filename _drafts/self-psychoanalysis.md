# main theme:

### my strongest social connections are the most toxic

my problems are socially imposed
- the statement "you are a mixture of the 5 people you spend the most
  time with" could not be more relevant to my situation
  - except, for me, there is only one person with whom i actually
    spend a lot of time with

- the assertion that my problems are socially imposed could not be
  more true and the only way to fix my problems are by changing my
  social settings.
  - that is it. it's simple. without change to my social settings and
    social experiences, ONE CANNOT REASONABLY EXPECT FOR MY PROBLEMS
    TO CHANGE.
    - this is the sad truth, considering I basically have no where
      else to turn for help besides my family, who is the source of
      toxicity in my life.
    - they are basically drawing me in to keep me close to ensure that
      my situation never truly changes. why? to save face and that's
      it. it is solely to retroactively justify all of the other
      mistreatment in my life!

### truly random information/behavior is distinct

truly random information/behavior is distinct from tightly-coupled,
functionally relevant information/behavior.

- it is trivial to determine if someone's behavior/reactions/tactics/objectives
  are tightly-coupled to one's own. (behavior/reactions/tactics/objectives)


- a perfect storm is a random occurance ... IN NATURE! A perfect storm
  in mental health treatment IS NOT A RANDOM OCCURANCE. There is
  simply too much human involvement from so many angles.
  - One must assume it cannot be chance.

### true change springs from the intention of change

true, long-term, positive change will be the result of positive
intention in the hearts of those around me.
- if i am surrounded by people who harbor negativity in their hearts,
  my situation will not change

# No Talk of My Personal Goals. That subject IS TABOO.

- there is no talk of how to change my situation. THERE IS SIMPLY NO
  *REAL* DISCUSSION OF GOALS, PLANS, IDEAS, OR *ANYTHING* that will
  result in real, positive, long-term change!
  - there's no discussion of it. the lack of discussion is an
    indication that no one around me harbors positive intent for my
    life in their hearts.
    - you don't hear discussion related to the expression of a desire
      for real change because the desire for real, positive change
      *SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST!*
  - this is why my mom, my brother, his family, my sister, her family
    simply do not talk about my goals: *because there is no thought
    arising from the intent to support my goals!* Again, it simply
    does not exist.

I have [?] main goals in my life and these subjects just so happen to
be TABOO at the dinner-table. As in: it is strictly VERBOTEN to
discuss any of my life goals, espcially in front of our younger, more
impressionable family members, WHO ARE NEVER TO LOOK UP TO ME. **GOD,
NO!** *BECAUSE MY FATE HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED!!*

#### &#x2605; Become as intelligent as I can. Learn as much as I can.

- via coursera, college, whatever

#### &#x2605; Learn skills that increase my employability, life experience and personal utility

- if my employability was a concern, my family would seek to act in
  ways that sets employability as a goal
  - they don't. my mom actively acts to subversively prevent me from
    becoming more employable
  - my brother doesn't enable me with opportunities for expanding my
    skillset. for example, he wouldn't let me work on a digital
    signage solution for the skating rink.
    - I SIMPLY WAS NOT ALLOWED! NOT ALOUD!
    - Again, this would be a project that every person who worked at
      the skate center would understand I completed. And every
      customer would use.
    - a cheap, raspberry-pi digital signage solution would demonstrate
      my skills and MAKE ME MORE EMPLOYABLE.
      - however, it is their goal to prevent me from achieving my
        goals
      - AGAIN, IT IS THEIR GOAL TO ACTIVELY, BUT SUBVERSIVELY PREVENT
        ME FROM ACHIEVING MY OWN GOALS!!
        - they absolutely don't want to get caught doing so -- because
          dear God that would be disgusting wouldn't it?
        - active, subversive sabotage from one's own family?!
          - that is unthinkable


  - when I take classes on coursera or when I'm working on
    a project,

#### &#x2605; Launch a Startup or App to become an Angel Investor

- never engouraged. always discouraged.
- when I talk about a startup or busines

#### &#x2605; Become the best programmer that I could be

- again, like my other goals and strategies to attain them, it's never
  encouraged & always discouraged.
  - no discussion about my skillset and no discussion about
    previous/current projects
  - they never encouraged me to involve my nieces or nephews in a
    project.
    - even though I have boundless experience which would be
      invaluable to share.

#### &#X2605; Develop 3D Visual & Audiovisual Art after developing 3D Rendering Engine skills

- no recognition of why this would be an important goal to work
  towards.
- again, never encouraged & always discouraged.
- never discussed with extended family members. never discussed with
  friends. they NEVER seek to understand what I'm working on
  - BUT THEY ARE SO QUICK TO DISCOURAGE ME FROM WORKING ON IT
  - without ever realistically considering the profitability in
    finances, skill or experience in such projects.

#### &#x2605; Write as much as I possibly can until I have nothing left to write (i have a decade's worth of material)

- i have about 50,000 words of content that is in draft form in my
  sources branch.
  - not just onlined, but mostly completed and ready to publish
- i have another 100k words of content that is in outline form in my
  sources branch.
- i have about 300k words of content in my
- i have about 300k words of fiction content in pre-outline form

to write in my drafts folder
  on the sources


#### &#x2605; Work with an editor to monetize my writing by publishing books

- i have at least two non-fiction books I could write AND SELL


### These are all realistic goals. Each and every one of them.

If i were to fail with one of them, I could exceed at another.


#### &#x2605; Stake my claim on immortality in the pages of history as a 21st Century Einstein.

Maybe this particular goal seems unrealistic. However, I can cite so
much evidence that would imply that I AM A 21ST CENTURY EINSTEIN. Yeh,
I'm about to make that argument.

Yet, I'm losing my claim to evidence supporting such a dramatic
conclusion: and this is what my family is threatening to ruin. They
are not just ruining my life. They are not just exacerbating my
personal prognosis.  They are preventing me from staking that claim:
that I am a 21st century Einstein.

How are they doing so? By disrupting my work and preventing me from
publishing information in a timely fashion.  Publishing such
information would allow me to stake my claim to high-level
developments, such as:

#### &#x2605: A Unified model for metanomics, based on probabilistic programming

EINSTEIN! Right here, in and of itself. This single theory implies
21st Century Einstein. And my family? They don't want to help me. They
want to prevent me from accomplishing this. And staking my claim to
such academic developments in a timely fashion.

All I have to do is publish the "Metanomics" series, which outlined
and partially drafted.

#### &#x2605: Ephemeral Theory of Linguistic Evolution during Ice Age, emphasizing self-organizing adherence to collective un/consciousness

In its current form, this idea is an interesting concept for a
fantasy/sci-fi series, at most. I haven't even personally verified
that this theory is distinguished from other theories of post-LGM
linguistic development. However, it should be trivial to develop
further and is at least an interesting theory.

Regardless, even presenting a summerization of this theory requires an
understanding of linguistics, anthropology, pre-history, sociology and...

# How else can i tell that my family does not have good intentions

I am at the shit end of set of very emotionally abusive relationships
with my family. The strongest social & emotional relationships I have
are toxic, corrosive, and detrimental to my mental health. They
exacerbate my emotional pain. They demonstrate willful, knowledgable
adherence to "treatment plan" or a set of correlated behaviors which
could only make someone with my diagnoses worse!!

That's what is so frustrating: not only do the people closest to me
act to ignore my pain and my PTSD/Asperger's, they are acting in a way
that implies that they are willfully and knowledgably complicit in
adhering to tactics which could only make my prognosis worse. The only
reason mental health practicioners would advise my family to act in
such a way is to exacerbate underlying causes related to my
diagnosis!! So, if they are working with someone else, that someone
else is very aware of my true diagnoses and has methodically relayed
information to my family TO EXACERBATE THESE PROBLEMS! TO MAKE MY
SITUATION WORSE AND USE MY FAMILY TO DO EXACTLY THAT.


#### &#x2605; Lack of encouragement/discussion related to my goals

#### &#x2605; Antithetical Disposition towards my goals and people who support me

#### &#x2605; Not allowed to be a Role Model

#### &#x2605; Active Interference with Mental Health

- when I establish a relationship with a mental health practicioner

#### &#x2605; General Suppression of Communication

#### &#x2605; No Discussion of Problems

#### &#x2605; No Written Discussion of Problems

#### &#x2605; They Pursue Action with Detrimental Consequences Without Discussing It With Me

- my mom and family sought action in the court system to get the state to put
  me away. my mom went so far as to say she'd been sworn in to the
  court system.
  - she did so without warning me (not a good sign)



#### &#x2605; Feigning Incompetence

-


#### &#x2605; Inaction when I complain about being bullied at work



#### &#x2605; Feigning Ignorance, Generally

generally, when a family member and I argue, if I talk about my
writing, they act like they don't understand
- they don't want to understand because it confers rhetorical
  ammunition. it gives me reasons to legitimize my work, my writing,
  my position in the world.
  - if they conveyed understanding of my writing, they would have to
    admit that I'm practically an einstein and that they've been
    complicit in the psychological torture of this person.
  - so they feign ignorance of the content
    - and at the same time, they GUILT me for EXPECTING that they have
      either read or would understand
    - total BS Barney Fife Bullshit: "Well Golley David, I guess we
      just aren't fancy intellectuals like you"
    - when they never seek to understand in the first place
    - they do so and they emphasize that I should feel guilty for
      asking them to read and to understand!! WHAT THE FUCK?!

- yet they seek no action to acquire understanding
  - that is, they don't try to understand any of the content
    themselves
    - 40% of which any college educated person should understand


- why don't they try to understand? because their actions are
  motivated by attempts to

#### &#x2605; Feigning Ignorance when it comes to mental health policy/action

- my mom actively injects herself into psychiatric relationships when
  it
  - she does so without notifying me: she got comfortable with access
    to patient info and capacity to manipulate the relationship with
    Dr. Mylan

#### &#x2605; Choosing Conversation Topics which Exclude Me

- in social situations with family members, they (sister & mother)
  seek to choose conversation topics which actively exclude me and limit
  conversation topics which my draw my interest or inclusion.
  - this is really a metric of how much someone wants you included in
    any situation.
  - in positive social situations, the people you are socializing will
    choose conversation subjects which demonstrate your skills, your
    social appeal, your positive traits, allow you to assert your
    identity and allow you to develop stronger connections with
    others!
  - in situations where some participants harbor negativity and
    resentment, you may find that these people leverage the subject of
    discussion and type of interactions to:
    - those which confer strenth/influence to themselves
      - that is, they are selfish
      - they monopolize conversation, etc
      - this really can't be helped and often signifies defect of
        personality. some people just do this
    - OR: far from a simple defect of personality, they activiely
      limit your exposure to cultivate positive relationships by
      employing such tactics as monoploization of conversation, etc
  - if u experience this enough, you'll notice such simple-minded tactics:
    - monopolization of conversation,
    - restriction of topics to discussion.
  - if it's truly happening AND IS OBVIOUS
    - THEN OTHER PEOPLE WILL BEGIN TO NOTICE
    - starting with the people who know you and are aware of tension

- again, when someone uses such simple-minded, rude, social tactics
  against someone who has difficulty learning about such social
  phenomena, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EITHER:
  - THEY ARE WILLFULLY IGNORANT OF ASPERGER'S **AT BEST!**
  - OR THEY ARE WILLFULLY USING YOUR DIAGNOSES' SOCIAL INEPTITUDE
    AGAINST YOU!!
    - HOLY FUCKING SHIT NO FUCKING WAY WHO THE FUCK WOULD DO THAT?!
    - OH!!! Oh!!!!!! YOUR FAMILY DOES THAT TO YOU?!!! YOUR FAMILY!!!??
    - LEVERAGES WHAT TO PLACE YOU IN A CONSTANT STATE OF ISOLATION AND
      DISADVANTAGE?! YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF ASPERGERS?!
    - Your
      [refrigerator mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator_mother_theory)
      does what? Intentionally?

#### &#x2605; Playing Ignorant when it comes to mental health actions


#### &#x2605; They Disregard the Reality of my Chronic Depression



#### &#x2605; They Disregard the reality of my Emotional Trauma & PTSD



#### &#x2605; They Disregard the reality of my Asperger's


#### &#x2605; Through their response to my appeals for help in any situation by invoking Guilt/Shame/Anxiety

so why should it come as a surprise that I'm hardly proactive about
reaching for psychological help?

#### &#x2605; Willful Disregard of My Statements and Arguments

There is no intellectual consequence when I talk to my family
- Mostly my mother, brother & sister.
  - They simply don't absorb any of my statements or arguments
  - There is no consequence to a discussion unless it moves me into a
    more disadvantageous disposition.
- it's as if they have been told to disregard what I say until such
  time when I can be locked away.
  - almost like they've been trained to treat me this way
- At best, it is as if they approach the situation believing that all
  of my statements & actions are to be regarded as the statements &
  actions of lunatic. That is, they approach any of my statements as
  though there is no basis in reality. As though, I should be wearing
  a straight jacket.
  - when, in fact, I have a coherent

At worst, it's as if they willfully disregard any of my statements as
part of an attempt to put me in a worse position.
- To cut off any aid/attention from others; to prevent from having too
  look or feel responsible for anything in my situation.

#### &#x2605;

#### &#x2605; No emphasis on routines (part of a total lack of realistic planning)

Tie into Aspergers Diagnosis
- this demonstrates willful ignorance of my diagnosis

#### &#x2605; Acting like they're the sole benefactors in my life.

- like I would have nothing else to fall back on
  - the intent here is to stoke my fear and compel me to remain
    cornered by emphasizing that I have no other options
  - while refusing to offer any further assistance
- "no one else has ever helped you" is a terrible message to drive
  home day after day, week after week
  - especially to someone who needs help, in general
  - and, specically, to someone who needs help with an abusive
    relationship (that of my mother)
- but this statement "we are the only one's who have ever helped you,
  no one else is will help you" is a staple in almost every single
  argument I have with my mom
  - this is one of her general fallback tactics, when she's close to
    losing an argument, she will invariable make this and other
    statements in an attempt to distract me.
  - she utilizes my poor short-term memory against me, which is
    another sign that she would use my own mental health issues
    against me.
  - so, she seeks to distract me from real progress, when discussing
    almost any issue.
    - she is antithetical to any real progress
    - she harbors intense negativity towards me in her heart
    - she does not want me to be successful, EVER
    - she actively wants me to fail.
    - she wants me to fail in a way that allows her to retain
      influence in how the story of my life is conveyed to other
      people.
    - she does not want to accept any accountability for my
      mis-treatment.
    - IT IS ABOUT SAVING FACE AND AVOIDING FAULT.
    - IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR DAVID CONNER.
    - IT IS ABOUT "HOW DO I LOOK LIKE I DIDN'T SET UP THIS MENTAL HEALTH TRAINWRECK"


    my mental health,
    family,


#### &#x2605; Gaslighting me

-

#### &#x2605; Generally shaming me or guilting me for everything

#### &#x2605; Shaming me for reaching out for medical & mental health

- shaming me for cost

#### &#x2605; They guilt me for lack of social maturity, while
 restricting learning experiences

 They continue to restricting me from experiencing the events which
 would provoke the kind of social maturation that occurs in 20-30 year
 olds. This

I can't emphasize how cruel this is. I have Asperger's. I don't know
how else to say it. I would have been much better off, but **I lacked
virtually all social interaction b/w the ages 20 to 30.** How can you
expect someone to socially develop who is intentionally isolated,
while subject to emotional trauma leaving him with PTSD. This occurs
with virtually zero emotional support system, where the people who are
supposed to be the strongest connections instead contribute to the
shaming and mentally corroding tactics.

It occurs for about a decade. And then the person who experiences the
pain, who's much worse off emotionally, is the person at fault?! When
can someone else accept some responsibility here?! How is it fair to
expect me to pick myself up? IT'S NOT! It is unrealistic to expect me
to do so and it implies that my family, at best, lacks a rational
plan.  And worse, it may imply their cooperation in a plan to
discredit and destabilize me.

Observing everything first-hand leaves me wondering how this perfect
storm of mental health treatment came together.

#### &#x2605; Their idea of "Treatment Plan" is wait idly by until
they have induced enough depression/aggrivation/guilt/shame to induce
some reaction that justifies locking me away, while claiming they were
simply "too busy" with their own lives and "it never was their problem
anyways"

#### &#x2605; Suppression of Propagation of Information Related to My Situation

#### &#x2605; Active Avoidance of Discussion of Problems or Treatment Plan

#### &#x2605; Active Avoidance of Discussion of PTSD or Asperger's

#### &#x2605; Active Engagement in Behavior which Exacerbates PTSD & Asperger's

#### &#x2605; Connections are not shared

#### &#x2605; Only negative information is propagated through the family's social connections

#### &#x2605; My social naivety is used against me. I am never informed to correct for negative behaviors; There are active attempts to prevent me from being exposed to or learning positive behaviors

#### &#x2605; Never rewarded with training on skills or experience. My
 brother and employees at the rink actively seek to prevent me from
 learning new on-the-job skills, which would improve my hireability!!

#### &#x2605; Restriction of new social/work experiences, from which I could learn!

#### &#x2605; Constantly guilted and shamed and controlled through
 invocation of negative emotional responses. In other words, my family,
 through their actions/reactions, compels me to suffer in a swamp of
 negative emotions. They exacerbate my depression and I know that my
 mom does this intentionally.

#### &#2605; There are active attempts to
