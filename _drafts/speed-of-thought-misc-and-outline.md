- title?


#### alternative phrases

- communication networks:
- information networks:
- convergence:
  - consensus
  - RAFT algorithm and/or PAXOS, but sometimes byzantines generals
    because why not constantinople


#### concepts that are difficult to succinctly reference:

  - social physics:
    - using analogies from physics and math to model social
      interactions
  - agents: people and bots
    - agents as in the concept of agency and ability to impact
      information and communication
    - how to simplify this? just refer to as agents? or
      information-processing entities?
  - instances of information:
    - generally just any representation of information ... quick short
      name for this?
  - players in social games:
    - should i just refer to these as agents?
    - is a distinct term appropriate? they are idealized as particles
      that exert influence on information systems


####

- information physics: does it merit its own "thing" ?
  - social physics overlaps heavily with information physics
    - but i find myself using the phrase "information mechanics and
      dynamics" countless times
  - information "movement" (thus, physics) is almost meaningless w/o a
    social context, even if one or all of the parties are automated.

- infonetworking:
  - ....



#### Peak Post-Modernism

![peak post modernism picture]()

- from the definition of the noosphere, define a spectral
  understanding of information (spectrum of information)
  - meta-modernism
    - people are trying to stand out more and more.
    - cyclic interplay b/w post/modernism

      people and autonomous agents understand cause & effect
    - other, higher level philosophical insights


- thesis for part four:
  - complexity of information dynamics in a converged world leads to a
    breakdown in causality
  - use imagery from that anime on the anisotropic


###

- Social physics is not scientific.
  - (when is it not scientific?!)
    - it's hard to distinguish S/Phys & social media data science
  - Any formulation is theoretic at best, since most applications are
    incomputable and most quantities are not measurable.
  - It's hard to draw a line between social physics and data science
    via social media analytics,
    - social data science and machine learning is proficient, assuming
      optimal UI design, optimally regular usage, etc.
    - however, it breaks down with adversarial signals.
    - many of the problems we experienced in 2016 can be solved, when
      you can resolve identity with greater confidence.
  - social media is not the problem. it is partly how people are
    learning to use social media, coupled with changes in
    phenom. implications of sociophysics



###


- emphasize that the only way to predict social behavior in todays
  world is by proactively driving patterns of behavior
  - so, everything is hopelessly incomputable and can't be modeled. in
    spite of that, proactive tactics can make social networks more
    predictable.
    - but because of adversarial dynamics driven by game theory,
      influential groups struggle to signal over networks to
      proactively drive behavior and can cause the system to become
      unpredictable in ways that can't be predicted...


# Evolutionary Dynamics of Sociophysical Modeled as a Boltzmann Machine

- what is a [boltzmann machine]()?
- probabilistic programming



# (Implications of (your perspective on) Social Physics, Networks and
Information Dynamics)

- possibly remove
- why attempting to quantify information structure/dynamics/diffusion,
  along with sociophysical models and game theory leads to deep
  philosophical conclusions about the significance/nature of
  information.
  - if you don't understand what i'm writing about, then it's easy to
    assume that a worldview based on a subjective-but-passionate
    understanding of some ideology (i.e. humanism or marxism) is
    sufficient for dictating or restraining policy.
  - if you don't understand this content (and it isn't easy) then you
    don't actually understand enough about life, society and, in
    particular, human behavior to predict how policy will affect
    people.
    - if your a passionate humanist and your goal is to help people,
      wouldn't it be useful to understand people, group dynamics, game
      theory to inform your political views?
    - if it's important to you to actually achieve the lofty goals and
      ideals that drive your passion, then you absolutely have to
      understand this subject, otherwise you are forever at a
      disadvantage, unware that you are a piece in someone else's
      game, a leaf blowing about in a windstorm.
- you might be a well-reasoned person living in a land of milk and
  honey who wishes for only the alleviation of human suffering, but
  the world is not full of sunshine and rainbows. life is a game and
  there are many players.
  - if your values and ideals are worth hard work and sacrifice to
    attain, then you have to understand how the other players in this
    game will react to you.

part four:
===============

- (Our shared fabric for (communication) is shedding its
  physicality, (its discrete quality), and finally its temporality,
  congealing into ...) 
  - illusion of separation

As limits on communication (converge) towards their
asymptotic ideals, information self-replicates (with evolutionary
dynamics) until it approaches aphysical ... 

- Information becomes free of physical constraint.
- it's notion of having originated in a location, being bound to
  location(s), etc begins to melt away.
- (each instantiation of a specific piece of information (connections)
  to physical instantiations gradually lose relevance.)


# Metaphysical Precipitation

Given growth of networking infrastructure and computational capacity
without limit, reality rapidly converges towards the metaphysical.
This results in the runaway precipitation of informational dynamics
whose structure and interactions increasingly preempt dynamics
originating in the physical.

This chaotic period eventually results in irrevocable disruption to
philosophical constructs. Perception of causality becomes intractible
as the ubiquity and opacity of information systems render cause and
effect unknowable. Understanding causality is complicated for both
humans and automated agents. Only the former is rendered powerless as
an unaided individual, whereas the latter is weakened in large systems
with high volumes of agents.

Eventually, the configuration of matter in the local physical space is
repurposed as hardware for quantum simulation, rendering its specific
configuration meaningful only in how it maps to a virtualization of an
information system, which is decoupled in a
[universal quantum simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_simulator)(UQS).
In its final state, with maximal integration of local matter, the laws
of physics become mostly inconsequential, since the information
systems determine the state, albeit non-deterministically.

Therefore, the significance of metaphysical forms does not ascend from
information encoded into matter because this final state of matter can
virtualize multitudes in a fluid form with no definite physical
representation. This is yet another argument against the Marxist
Dialectic, since the representation of a program with arbitrary
structure can be represented within the UQS.

Actually demonstrating the existence and mechanics of a UQS would
strengthen the argument, although it was theoretically shown to be
possible. Whether a UQS could, perhaps physically, conclusively
resolve the divide between the Marxist and Hegelian dialectics,
depends on the specific mechanics of UQS. Primarily at issue is how a
UQS entwines the Quantum Simulator(QS) program within its own state
results in varying degrees of virtualization. A Universal Turing
Machine (UTM) entwines a representation of the simulated Turing
machine within its own machine's tape. To prove the Hegelian
dialectic, it is not necessary, but is ideal for the QS program
representation to be purely virtualized within the UQS. Further, it
could be argued that a QS itself contains sufficiently convoluted
physical information representation such that the reliance on a UQS is
not needed.

### Totality of Physical Eclipse

- (is there a better explanation of this?)
- the convergence of individual belief systems accelerates and the
  more strongly convergent metaphyiscal ideas begin manifesting in the
  physical aspects of social interactions.
  - so, if instead of mass communication channels being completely
    decentralized, the information diseminated was harmonized, then
    the more unitary, regular and pronounced these metaphysical
    manisfestations will become.
  - so, in terms of social physics, there are stronger physical
    effects that emerge from the metaphysical than ever before. This
    is true even in the discord of decentralized high bandwidth
    digital communication. Because of the evolutionary dynamics of
    ideas and memes, the strongest earn extremely high rates of
    propagation.

### The Ablation of Causality

- (remove focus on privacy from the following)
- (none of this means technology or social media or IoT is inherently
  bad by the way, just that our world is evolving towards a
  fundamentally different one and this evolution is inevitable)
  - so we have to understand it because the following philosophical,
    psychological, and sociocultural changes are fundamentally
    different in a way that is very difficult to understand

- the most important: in a post-convergence world, causality itself
  operates in a fundamentally different way, which can be
  anticipated by observing the evolution of various graphs

- social media, data science, internet of things, etc are part of a
  continuing trend of technology and quantification of human behavior
  that has been eroding privacy for decades.
  - this causes a fundamental shift in the way people interact
  - information can now spread through the social graph in
    fundamentally different ways.
    - the social graph has always existed, but until the 19th century
      was almost entirely limited to communication via edges which
      were physical in some way)
    - instead of a world where every person has six degrees of
      separation, we are gradually converging towards a social
      paradigm where "degrees of separation" is mostly meaningless,
      (in and of itself (?))
      - it's because the graph that represents all the paths that
        information can take to reach some other human node is
        converging towards the complete graph
        - albeit a complete graph where nearly all edges would be
          removed upon sparsification, but the phenomenon of
          near-completeness is there
    - at the same time, we are producing and processing data at an
      exponential rate.
      - there are finitely many human behaviors that can be quantified

- there is a paradigm shift in the phenomenon of causality, as it
    applies to human behavior and psychosocial dynamics,
    - causality, in this sense, stems from exchange of information,
      completeness of information, awareness of information,
      dissemination of information, etc.
      - there are many other important factors that help define how
        humans perceive causation in their behavioral interactions,
        whether those are individuals or groups of people ....
      - however, causality and the way humans utilize their
        understanding of it to construct a (set?) of beliefs/knowledge
        about the world is in a very big way parameterized by the
        paradigm of information exchange/retention/diffusion/etc
    - therefore, in an increasingly connected world, there is a major
      shift in how narratives are constructed and propagated.
  - this paradigm shift for causality affects any information
    processing entity, including both people and computers
    - this shift affects these groups in different ways
    - people store & process & propagate information
      differently than computers
      - i.e. they tend to be arbitrary and "imperfect" in how they
        handle information
      - the conclusions that can be reached by understanding the shift
        in causality very greatly depending on the specifics, so
        assertions based on generalities may do more harm than good
        (e.g. this explanation itself of the shift in causality is
        overly general)
  - this ablation of causality gradually roots itself accross the
    world at varying rates.

- the concept of privacy is one of the most important ways this shift
  in causality will affect human interactions and their understanding
  of the world from what they infer to be cause & effect in events
  - individuality will be blurred, people may adopt more
    groupthink-motivated behaviors. these two things are fairly simple
    to understand as our privacy is eroded
  - if or when we reach a society with a near-total lack of privacy,
    information propagates with a degree of completeness that implies
    people are significantly impaired in their ability to reason about
    the nature of cause and effect
    - this is because every exchange in units of information
      essentially initiates its own new chain of cause/effect and
      because of the total-convergence of the systems used to exchange
      information/data, ... (there is more data and more events
      tendinging to inflate this phenomenon exponentially
      ("tetrationally"... lulz))
    - for example, making conclusions about the disemination of pieces
      of information (how one piece of information spreads amoungst
      people) may become simply impossible
      - this is strongly dependent on the specific networks of
        people/hardware/telecom and other factors (rewrite and
        explain)
        - basically some groups can push back against this trend
          (i.e. military, government), but they still have to deal
          with a world where the majority of people are connected to
          networks where causality (becomes unknowable and
          unpredictable)
