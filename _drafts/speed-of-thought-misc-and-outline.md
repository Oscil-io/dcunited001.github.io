#### concepts that are difficult to succinctly reference:

  - social physics:
    - using analogies from physics and math to model social
      interactions
  - agents: people and bots
    - agents as in the concept of agency and ability to impact
      information and communication
    - how to simplify this? just refer to as agents? or
      information-processing entities?
  - instances of information:
    - generally just any representation of information ... quick short
      name for this?
  - players in social games:
    - should i just refer to these as agents?
    - is a distinct term appropriate? they are idealized as particles
      that exert influence on information systems


### application of art to these philosophical ideas:

#### social physics

    - sociophysical circuits (and superimposition of topologies)
    - holon/holonome & information as particle, w/ wave/particle
      duality
    - entanglement of iotas/datums (& collapse of kantian categories)

#### spectral decoherence of information/semiotics

    - the intersection of this idea with kantian categories
      - i.e. if the variety/quantity of information expands
        exponentially, while any two individuals' history of
        information consumption simultaneously diverges
        - the set of information

      - but this trend creates ... ?
  - evolution from ... ? thanks alot ADD

  - misc:

#### ante-modernism

- (refer to draft on ephemeral nature of linguistic evolution)

#### "social-neuro-linguistic"

with requirements for development of language and the explosion of
neural development that occurs after social behavior encourages
consensus of abstraction. all of these factors feed back into
themselves and result in the development of language


## Structure of information as memes, datums, iotas

#### **Meme(s)** a monoidal information-type that can be expressed to produce a datum, a unit of information.

- important to state that these definitions are for modeling
  information metaphysically

By making memes monoidal, it implies three kinds of behaviors. First,
given nothing: it expresses a datum representing the meme structure.
Second, the meme can contain additional structure that describes how
it should transform input. Third, the meme can accept input that
describes how it should transform the other components of the
input. In this way, it represents itself with an expressable datum
that also encodes its normal expression behavior, which can be
externally modulated.

#### **Datum(s)** a unit of information.

The expression of a meme produces a datum.

Datum structures without values

- are instanceless because they already exist from a combinatorial
  expansion
  - i can understand how to combinatorially generate a set of category
    structures where the objects are undefined. each member of this
    set could be a monoid that generates an instance of category by
    providing instantiations of its objects (e.g. sets) and morphisms
    (e.g. set mutations.
  - this combinatorially generated set of category structures is
    countable (afai can see)
    - it is generated from a very small set of information
  - but what i wanted was to map iotas, instances of the information,
    to pregenerated datums, so that all possible forms of information
    can be shown to already pre-exist
  - another problem is that the structure of each morphism depends on
    the mutated objects.

Datums can be visualized as graphs, but are modeled on categories with
objects and morphisms, which are also objects. The benefit here is a
finite set of primative datums can be combinatorially generated from a
finite set

#### **Iota(s)** an instance of a datum.


- the

- a datum is a piece of information, where equality to some other
  datum is not necessarily dependent on the instance.
- a datum can be made into a meme by making some part of it mutable.
  - in this way, the meme is a type that generates
- a meme has a datum representing itself

#### Peak Post-Modernism

![peak post modernism picture]()

- from the definition of the noosphere, define a spectral
  understanding of information (spectrum of information)
  - meta-modernism
    - people are trying to stand out more and more.
    - cyclic interplay b/w post/modernism

#### structure of series:

  - content from other drafts?
    - create/push branch with a copy of the current parapets drafts in
      tact before i cannabalize it
    - parapets part two:
      - section on hip hop
      - section on data science and black lives matter?
    - parapets part 4:
      - a ton about social media & algorithms
      - part 3 is mostly not relevant
    - peace-power-prosperity (possibly a few valuable snippets)

- describe information economics and how the medium of transmission
  affects supply/demand
- references to a grimoire for an analogy to old ideas becoming more
  visible

#### Part Two: Social Physics

1. (reuse segment from parapet-2 on thermopylae, etc as intro?)
2. discribe how information reverberates around the world
   - some basic ideas, such as social connectivity and the economic
     benefits. minimum/maximum of connectivity in today's world
3. overview of basic concepts of social physics, along with
   everyday examples
   - the most important conclusions from understanding social
     physics
   - how telecom/internet changes social physics
4. informal postulates of social physics.
   - most critical inferences from social physics
   - definition of power as the potential to trigger flux
   - mechanics of power
5. physical analogies
   - people as particles: temperature, density, state, etc.
   - speed of sound
   - phase changes
   - configurational entropy & conformational entropy

#### Part Three: geometry and mechanics of information

- thesis: how the geometry and structure of information affects its
  diffusion.
  - the specifics of datums, the spectrum of info,
  - the capacity of information to persist, replicate, be quantified,
    be compared to, be equated with, etc.

    - the structure of information (semiotics, linguistics, etc)
    - "mechanical" aspects of information
      - the language it's written in might cause it to move in
        different ways
      - the specific ideas it concerns might similarly determine
        "motion"
     - the information warfare content i outlined after writing the fb
       post

#### part four: future evolution of information (metaphys. precip.)

    1. metaphysical precipitation
    2. start with warning on how tech leads to a breakdown in how
      people and autonomous agents understand cause & effect
    - other, higher level philosophical insights

- thesis for part four:
  - complexity of information dynamics in a converged world leads to a
    breakdown in causality
  - use imagery from that anime on the anisotropic


- we need to focus on how those fundamentals of
  communication/information, in the context of convergence/etc

- (this leads to drastically different conclusions on what humanity's
  purpose is and what our challenges are)

Humanity needs to identify and magnify its common ground. Law and
action should... promote incentivization.

We all have to own this, wherever it leads. Pain from past and present
conflict threatens to motivate future tension.

Systems with properly structured incentivization models always
reinforce


  - blinded by our ego
  - information saturation & overstimulation
  - individuality/privacy is diminished
  - causality becomes incredibly difficult to understand

###

- Social physics is not scientific.
  - (when is it not scientific?!)
    - it's hard to distinguish S/Phys & social media data science
  - Any formulation is theoretic at best, since most applications are
    incomputable and most quantities are not measurable.
  - It's hard to draw a line between social physics and data science
    via social media analytics,
    - social data science and machine learning is proficient, assuming
      optimal UI design, optimally regular usage, etc.
    - however, it breaks down with adversarial signals.
    - many of the problems we experienced in 2016 can be solved, when
      you can resolve identity with greater confidence.
  - social media is not the problem. it is partly how people are
    learning to use social media, coupled with changes in
    phenom. implications of sociophysics

###

- emphasize that the only way to predict social behavior in todays
  world is by proactively driving patterns of behavior
  - so, everything is hopelessly incomputable and can't be modeled. in
    spite of that, proactive tactics can make social networks more
    predictable.
    - but because of adversarial dynamics driven by game theory,
      influential groups struggle to signal over networks to
      proactively drive behavior and can cause the system to become
      unpredictable in ways that can't be predicted...

# Using Social Physics to Contain/Promote People and Ideas

### Muting A Target's Identity

- turn down volume of someone by refusing to refer to their
  name/identity. the more their name, their identity or details
  related to life are referenced, the more that those details diffuse
  into the sociophysical environment
  - as in Voldemort, "he who should not be named"
  - this has many effects, including driving someone crazy, who is
    always referred to in the 4th person or as a "ghost"
  - this artificially reduces any sociophysical signal related to
    their identity and prevents others from perpetuating it.
  - once the person is no longer around, very little memory or residue
    remains of their existence.
    - DEATH OF A SALESMAN
  - taken to the extreme, this person is a living ghost and simply
    haunts from one place to another, where people who happen to see
    them have to deal with what is in front of their eyes, but never
    authentically try to interact or develop a relationship
    - if you are this person, you'll notice how fast people try to
      shut down or redirect conversations you want to have. this is
      because they don't want other people to retain positive memory
      of you or anything you are interested in.
    - if you have aspergers or other issues where you lack strong
      social skills, you'd never know what it's like to live a normal
      life. you'd simply never know the difference. this is my life.

- say what you will, but this simply optimizes sociophysical ideas:
  number of references to you, rate/quality of new social connections,
  rate/quality of social interactions, depth of conversation, etc.

### Isolation of Social Graph Boundaries

- The physical or graph boundaries of someone's social network can be
  identified, as well as nodes & regions of it that are more widely
  connected.
  - Boundaries and local connectedness are ideas that are widely
    studied in graph theory.
  - Information is viral and causes people to react differently. Some
    people are loud, others are quiet. Most everyone acts to bring
    about some understanding of what is "good" and by framing
    information in those terms, it can be presented in such a way to
    subtly cue the person to action.
  - Most everyone that acts righteously feels good about what they do.
  - So if you suggest information to highly connected, nodes on the
    boundaries of someone's social network, it leads adjacent nodes to
    move further away from the person and become less connected in
    general.
  - Life is full of flux in the social structure. People move away,
    start families and there are many other events which change the
    social graph. People gravitate towards the areas of their social
    graph where the social connections were reinforced.
    - The person who does not or can not both gradually grow new
      strong connections or reinforce existing social connections will
      end up isolating themselves, if this goes on long enough.
    - by injecting information into someone's graph that increases
      resistence of new connection, disrupts existing connections or
      forces most social interactions to be lensed through a negative
      frame, you can isolate someone. In most circumstances, this does
      not happen because one person simply cannot exert that much
      influence over the boundary of someone's social network.

  - however, if you end up social isolated, it can be very difficult
    to build new connections.
    - this depends on many factors, including how widely information
      has been disseminated that alters the implicit frame someone's
      social interactions.
      - for example, celebrity defamed by scandal can have a VERY
        difficult time building their network back. Since information
        is viral, its effects are multiplicative, including how it
        poisons the frame. people in these social circles gravitate
        towards where they anticipate that influence *will* be, not
        where it is and certainly not where it was.

### Limiting Financial/Social Capital & Options

- financial capital and social capital are exchangable resources.
  - a clever person can exchange financial capital for social capital
    and vice versa, using social capital to multiply their influence
    or identify new opportunities.

  - if you find yourself isolated, you are vulnerable. Depending on
    personality traits, social (potential) and financial capital. it
    can be far more challenging for you to rebound than it is for a
    small group of sycophantic people to indirectly keep you there,
    without ever appearing to have lifted a finger.

  - when your financial capital is limited, you have few options, you
    are strained and this makes you very predictable. when you're
    social behavior is predictable, this means you invest in social
    expansion in a limited number of ways. this makes you more easily
    blocked, especially in the age of social media, where people who
    want to promote themselves post everything online.
    - this kind of indirect coordination is not natural social
      behavior. it doesn't emerge in social groups who have primarily
      individual concerns or simply care about those close to them.
    - this kind of group behavior can be coordinated, kind of like
      someone decided to make sociopathy a team sport.
    - one way this can happen is if a handful of people inject the
      right information into the few circumstances where you try to
      socially expand to compel judgemental, exclusionary behavior
      from neural people. several people can indirectly work through
      others and manipulate what is otherwise natural behavior.
    - i think this is what they call "scientology". however, it's
      strange that a religion based on freeing you from information
      forms known as thetans would also project those same negative
      information forms into your life, but i suppose they just hoping
      you'll develop stockholm syndrome and will pay them to help
      "clean" it up later.
    - if you think this is wrong, i can explain their training
      materials, pattern languages and obsession over "disconnection"
      *THIS IS DISCONNECTION*, by the way.

### When targets are muted and/or isolated, adversaries have major advantages in amplifying information (to establish it as a baseline)

- if you are isolated for months, ...
  - if you are muted and other people can't talk about you or your
    life events, it means that adversaries can project & amplify their
    own signal in neighborhoods of your social network
  - their narrative becomes dominant and you will always be reacting
    to it (...)
    - the signal of your personal account will always be (nearly
      insignificant) if some group of people can actually pull this
      off
    - if a group of people did this to you, you can be sure that they
      will listen for & react to your diminished signal, while
      continuing to amplify their own and walling you into a very
      small set of social connections
      - you won't be able to expand (...)

# (Implications of (your perspective on) Social Physics, Networks and Information Dynamics)

- possibly remove
- why attempting to quantify information structure/dynamics/diffusion,
  along with sociophysical models and game theory leads to deep
  philosophical conclusions about the significance/nature of
  information.
  - if you don't understand what i'm writing about, then it's easy to
    assume that a worldview based on a subjective-but-passionate
    understanding of some ideology (i.e. humanism or marxism) is
    sufficient for dictating or restraining policy.
  - if you don't understand this content (and it isn't easy) then you
    don't actually understand enough about life, society and, in
    particular, human behavior to predict how policy will affect
    people.
    - if your a passionate humanist and your goal is to help people,
      wouldn't it be useful to understand people, group dynamics, game
      theory to inform your political views?
    - if it's important to you to actually achieve the lofty goals and
      ideals that drive your passion, then you absolutely have to
      understand this subject, otherwise you are forever at a
      disadvantage, unware that you are a piece in someone else's
      game, a leaf blowing about in a windstorm.
- you might be a well-reasoned person living in a land of milk and
  honey who wishes for only the alleviation of human suffering, but
  the world is not full of sunshine and rainbows. life is a game and
  there are many players.
  - if your values and ideals are worth hard work and sacrifice to
    attain, then you have to understand how the other players in this
    game will react to you.


### Social Mechanics

- mathematically accounting for the psychosocial dynamic of "opposites
  attract" for basic/sophisticated personality types
  - if connections and interactions b/w people are facilitated
    alleviating the gradient of disparity of knowledge/information,
    then what does this say generally about people who are basic and
    people who are well-educated
    - what are the psychosocial dynamics that emerge between
      combinated pairings/groupings of people
      - how do these dynamics change when people have various ranges
        of aggregate knowledge levels or various ranges of knowledge
        levels in specific fields
  - this becomes more complicated when considering the same problem
    for various types of knowledge (i.e. level of sophistication in
    various fields)
  - but, generally, people who have a higher disparity in
    knowledge/information from different fields will have more to talk
    about or more value to offer each other in terms of the knowledge
    they have to share.
  - "if you're the smartest person in the room, find another room."
- typologies of variation in psycho/socio/cultural dimensions,
  quantified with social media data.
- exploiting social media filter bubbles to create false consensus
  effect in targets, which can contribute to gaslighting campaigns

#### [Operational Lvl of Information Warfare](http://te.xel.io/posts/2017-02-21-civil-disobedience-and-operational-strategy-in-information-warfare.html)

...


part four:
===============

- (Our shared fabric for (communication) is shedding its
  physicality, (its discrete quality), and finally its temporality,
  congealing into ...)
  - illusion of separation

As limits on communication (converge) towards their
asymptotic ideals, information self-replicates (with evolutionary
dynamics) until it approaches aphysical ...

- Information becomes free of physical constraint.
- it's notion of having originated in a location, being bound to
  location(s), etc begins to melt away.
- (each instantiation of a specific piece of information (connections)
  to physical instantiations gradually lose relevance.)




- this understanding of the radical differences b/w pre and
  post-Singularity world implies we must all understand social
  physics.
  - while social physics might be the knowledge which the wealthy, the
    elite and the shadowy "powers that be" have used to determine the
    course of human civilization, etc, etc.
    - the world will be transformed at a fundamental level and for
      *anyone* to function in it, the common person must be permitted
      to build upon an understanding of basic social physics

- otherwise, one of three unacceptable things will happen:
  - (1) reminiscent of the burning of the Library of Alexandria, the
    currently powerful will torch the current regime of history &
    information, leaving the the common person buried alive in some
    false paradigm.
    - "the illuminati" from a sense of responsibility from a partial
      understanding of social physics decide to "collapse the system"
      to retain control, either passively or actively
      - i don't believe in a single organization like this, but there
        are shadowy conspiratorial forces that have prefered to
        artificially destabalize some regions in order to shift
        influence and financial resources elsewhere
    - here, the destabalization results from artificial attempts for a
      fragment of the population to attempt to retain control

  - (2) attempts to control information, thought, and especially
    dissent result in a totally false belief system enforced via
    disinformation and neurological mind control
    - this results in a total loss of individuality and the total
      stagnation of evolutionary mechanisms which make humanity
      stronger as a whole
    - this mind control & etc does not geographically roll out on a
      global scale simultaneously, leading to destabilization from
      (...) and the aforementioned effects on individuality &
      evolutionary mechanisms
      - this, other factors (like the international response to these
        old and new mind control techniques) leads to destabalization.

  - (3) runaway chaos results from a lack of understanding of this new
    sociophysical paradigm almost dominated by information made
    manifest.
    - old modes of thinking dominate. classical war, greed,
      corruption, etc prevail. The world destabilizes and what are
      essentially the seven deadly sins lead to escalation of
      conflict.
    - here, the destabilization results from misunderstanding,
      distrust, lack of cooperation, informational problems, and
      traditional human fallability
      - above all, it's the desire to dominate this new world of
        information that leads to the incentivization of conflict
    - if this plays out, we may find ourselves trapped in a desolated
      world, completely unable to respond to overpopulation concerns,
      where the average person is so horribly fucked up by an
      archetype of deluvian scale, caused by merciless, ignorant human
      malice
      - the absolute worst part of such a world is that, YOU CANNOT
        SURVIVE AS A VIRTUOUS PERSON.
        - from there on out, the horrible neodeluvian archetype
          produces a dark age of chaos, hatred and malice

  - common themes of these scenarios
    - the common person is trapped within a world they don't
      understand, where there are no limitations on what is right,
      what is wrong, what can be made abject reality
    - if we ever incentivized cooperation, promoted a shared
      understanding of the world, and unleashed the human potential,
      more of us would have been able to individually channel more of
      our energy
      - if nothing else, then post-disaster, there wouldn't be an
        archetypical sentiment that we were lied to, deceived and
        totally fucked by the rich OR the powerful -- truly they are
        one and the same, financial influence is like abstract,
        commoditized social influence.

- (probably won't publish this)
- SO HOLY !@#$ I KNOW WHY I AM TRYING TO *UNITE* PEOPLE.
  - i know what happens. i know how people work. i know the systems
    they use. I can describe these systems and phenomena in greater
    detail than anyone I know, personally
    - if i had read more works of philosophy, i would probably see
      what I have written throughout it.
    - however, my work is more dense than anything i've ever read or
      been allowed to be exposed to -- and *because* of that and
      *because* it deals with power, semiotics and the architecture of
      belief systems that people claim it is dangerous.
      - i believe it is more dangerous for people to *NOT* understand
        this.
      - i'm looking 2, 5, 10, 50, 1000 years ahead.
        - i don't give a fuck about money
        - i don't give a fuck about fame
        - i don't give a fuck about comfort
        - i don't give a fuck about the next quarter's earnings
        - i don't give a fuck about winning an election
        - i don't give a fuck about offending someone (insofar as it
          doesn't affect my ability to save humanity)
          - however, I'M NOT ALLOWED TO RECEIVE SOCIAL SIGNALS BECAUSE
            I AM *DISCONNECTED*, so how the fuck would I know anyway.
      - i'm sorry, but i do not have faith that quells my frustration
        and anxiety over human fallibility. i know how groups respond
        to each other. i know what my value to society is
      - i am being told that i belong in a fucking sociophysical cage
        - i am being constantly reminded that everything i know that
          is wrong that other people don't see *isn't being addressed*
    - i am encouraged by some of the changes i've seen ... or at
      least, i was. now i know what is happening. and the country i
      love is being driven apart
      - by lies, by deceipt, for need of political expedience
      - i don't want to cast judgement on the left, the right,
        whatever. i just want to see people work together. until i see
        enemies huggin it out and actually practicing what they preach
        (love, God, whatever it is), then i am going to continue to be
        concerned.
      - what is your intent? is it to bring people together? or is
        your understanding of your intentions driven more by
        irrational fear than by a desire for unity?
    - i do not fear the human potential, but i do fear human
      fallibility, especially in the face of technonihilism

# Metaphysical Precipitation

Given growth of networking infrastructure and computational capacity
without limit, reality rapidly converges towards the metaphysical.
This results in the runaway precipitation of informational dynamics
whose structure and interactions increasingly preempt dynamics
originating in the physical.

This chaotic period eventually results in irrevocable disruption to
philosophical constructs. Perception of causality becomes intractible
as the ubiquity and opacity of information systems render cause and
effect unknowable. Understanding causality is complicated for both
humans and automated agents. Only the former is rendered powerless as
an unaided individual, whereas the latter is weakened in large systems
with high volumes of agents.

Eventually, the configuration of matter in the local physical space is
repurposed as hardware for quantum simulation, rendering its specific
configuration meaningful only in how it maps to a virtualization of an
information system, which is decoupled in a
[universal quantum simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_simulator)(UQS).
In its final state, with maximal integration of local matter, the laws
of physics become mostly inconsequential, since the information
systems determine the state, albeit non-deterministically.

Therefore, the significance of metaphysical forms does not ascend from
information encoded into matter because this final state of matter can
virtualize multitudes in a fluid form with no definite physical
representation. This is yet another argument against the Marxist
Dialectic, since the representation of a program with arbitrary
structure can be represented within the UQS.

Actually demonstrating the existence and mechanics of a UQS would
strengthen the argument, although it was theoretically shown to be
possible. Whether a UQS could, perhaps physically, conclusively
resolve the divide between the Marxist and Hegelian dialectics,
depends on the specific mechanics of UQS. Primarily at issue is how a
UQS entwines the Quantum Simulator(QS) program within its own state
results in varying degrees of virtualization. A Universal Turing
Machine (UTM) entwines a representation of the simulated Turing
machine within its own machine's tape. To prove the Hegelian
dialectic, it is not necessary, but is ideal for the QS program
representation to be purely virtualized within the UQS. Further, it
could be argued that a QS itself contains sufficiently convoluted
physical information representation such that the reliance on a UQS is
not needed.

### Totality of Physical Eclipse

- (is there a better explanation of this?)
- the convergence of individual belief systems accelerates and the
  more strongly convergent metaphyiscal ideas begin manifesting in the
  physical aspects of social interactions.
  - so, if instead of mass communication channels being completely
    decentralized, the information diseminated was harmonized, then
    the more unitary, regular and pronounced these metaphysical
    manisfestations will become.
  - so, in terms of social physics, there are stronger physical
    effects that emerge from the metaphysical than ever before. This
    is true even in the discord of decentralized high bandwidth
    digital communication. Because of the evolutionary dynamics of
    ideas and memes, the strongest earn extremely high rates of
    propagation.


### (further detail on "metaphysical precipitation" via superconnectness)

The multiplicity of all spatiotemporal interactions, previously
constrained to physical space, will now tetrate incomprehensibly.
*This confounding the perception of causality for any primary type of
agent*, wherefore the potential for causal inference is ablated,
thereby corroding the utility of causal inferences. This is
terrifying: what happens, specifically and causally, becomes
increasingly decoupled and *doesn't affect subsequent events*. The
chains of cause and effect aren't broken. They simply fade away as
amplified signals from informational dimensions crowd out and confuse
the effects of physical and events. That is, metaphysical phenomena
begin to manifest in our spacetime and become increasingly causal
while unconstrained complexity prevents all entities and humans
especially from operating with regard to the *TRUTH* of cause and
effect. Again, this is terrifying.

This is essentially the merger of metaphysical dimensions with our
local spacetime, wherever there is runaway computational density.
Additional and ancillary dimensions expand spatial degrees of freedom,
profoundly changing mechanics of interactions. While these
informational dimensions are not Euclidean, the
[Poincaré conjecture's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GItmC9lxeco)
famous
[homotopy sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_sphere)
demonstrates that higher dimensions have idiosyncratic qualities.

Braid groups in four dimensions provides a simpler math metaphor for
demonstrating that constraints in 3D can be loosened or annihilated on
the addition of a single Euclidean dimension. Traditional 3D braid
group problems are trivial in higher dimensions. For a more clear
understanding of the above concept, watch this

[Braids In Higher Dimensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_uybVKBacI),
which features a mathematician who also collaborated
[on the work pictured above](https://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/Talks/Northeastern-1602/index.html).

These higher dimensions have always reached into our world via
sociophysical phenomena. Our nearly superconnected telecom
infrastructure will obliterate the physical and even logical
constraints confining these extradimensional effects on our world.
Their symbolic and information impact on our local spacetime will
produce the visible, undeniable precipitation of the metaphysical in
our realm. The network effect between superconnected entities
dissolves limitations on the interaction mechanics for some of those
entities.


### The Ablation of Causality

- (remove focus on privacy from the following)
- (none of this means technology or social media or IoT is inherently
  bad by the way, just that our world is evolving towards a
  fundamentally different one and this evolution is inevitable)
  - so we have to understand it because the following philosophical,
    psychological, and sociocultural changes are fundamentally
    different in a way that is very difficult to understand

- the most important: in a post-convergence world, causality itself
  operates in a fundamentally different way, which can be
  anticipated by observing the evolution of various graphs
  - (causality has never been easy to understand)

- social media, data science, internet of things, etc are part of a
  continuing trend of technology and quantification of human behavior
  that has been eroding privacy for decades.
  - this causes a fundamental shift in the way people interact
  - information can now spread through the social graph in
    fundamentally different ways.
    - the social graph has always existed, but until the 19th century
      was almost entirely limited to communication via edges which
      were physical in some way)
    - instead of a world where every person has six degrees of
      separation, we are gradually converging towards a social
      paradigm where "degrees of separation" is mostly meaningless,
      (in and of itself (?))
      - it's because the graph that represents all the paths that
        information can take to reach some other human node is
        converging towards the complete graph
        - albeit a complete graph where nearly all edges would be
          removed upon sparsification, but the phenomenon of
          near-completeness is there
    - at the same time, we are producing and processing data at an
      exponential rate.
      - there are finitely many human behaviors that can be quantified

- there is a paradigm shift in the phenomenon of causality, as it
  applies to human behavior and psychosocial dynamics,
    - causality, in this sense, stems from exchange of information,
      completeness of information, awareness of information,
      dissemination of information, etc.
      - there are many other important factors that help define how
        humans perceive causation in their behavioral interactions,
        whether those are individuals or groups of people ....
      - however, causality and the way humans utilize their
        understanding of it to construct a (set?) of beliefs/knowledge
        about the world is in a very big way parameterized by the
        paradigm of information exchange/retention/diffusion/etc
    - therefore, in an increasingly connected world, there is a major
      shift in how narratives are constructed and propagated.
  - this paradigm shift for causality affects any information
    processing entity, including both people and computers
    - this shift affects these groups in different ways
    - people store & process & propagate information
      differently than computers
      - i.e. they tend to be arbitrary and "imperfect" in how they
        handle information
      - the conclusions that can be reached by understanding the shift
        in causality very greatly depending on the specifics, so
        assertions based on generalities may do more harm than good
        (e.g. this explanation itself of the shift in causality is
        overly general)
  - this ablation of causality gradually roots itself accross the
    world at varying rates.

- the concept of privacy is one of the most important ways this shift
  in causality will affect human interactions and their understanding
  of the world from what they infer to be cause & effect in events
  - individuality will be blurred, people may adopt more
    groupthink-motivated behaviors. these two things are fairly simple
    to understand as our privacy is eroded
  - if or when we reach a society with a near-total lack of privacy,
    information propagates with a degree of completeness that implies
    people are significantly impaired in their ability to reason about
    the nature of cause and effect
    - this is because every exchange in units of information
      essentially initiates its own new chain of cause/effect and
      because of the total-convergence of the systems used to exchange
      information/data, ... (there is more data and more events
      tendinging to inflate this phenomenon exponentially
      ("tetrationally"... lulz))
      - *dilineate causality as it is processed by different types of
        autonomous agents*
    - for example, making conclusions about the disemination of pieces
      of information (how one piece of information spreads amoungst
      people) may become simply impossible
      - this is strongly dependent on the specific networks of
        people/hardware/telecom and other factors (rewrite and
        explain)
        - basically some groups can push back against this trend
          (i.e. military, government), but they still have to deal
          with a world where the majority of people are connected to
          networks where causality (becomes unknowable and
          unpredictable)
