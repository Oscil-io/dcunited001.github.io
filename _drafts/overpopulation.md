### (Addressing Depopulation Conspiracy Theories)

(Or... why this is really dumb, yet actually kind of a real thing)
- (hmmm i should just skip the discussion and get straight ot the
  point, removing most of this section)

- everyone knows there are contingency plans in place for marshall
  law, etc in America and every other country.
  - I'm sure you've heard about them in spooky youtube videos.
  - Not to completely discredit all of those videos, but most of them
    are bogus. the programs, however? they're real.
  - yet, they are well intentioned. only a criminally negligent
    government would lack a plan in case of a major, major disaster
    - the more resources they have to plan, the more complicated their
      disaster programs are.
    - yet, just because they exist doesn't mean that the government is
      plotting to use this stuff. they are ready; that is all.
- however, there are real conspiracies out there for depopulation
  involving viruses, war, etc. but most of this stuff is more about
  brainstorming potential disasters than planned massive depopulation.

forget the hypothetical conspiracy theories, which are often moreso
designed to keep you captivated and distracted. yes, that's right: I
just said conspiracy theories are conspiracy theories LMAO
- usually there's some truth to each of these. if there wasn't, they'd
  fall apart pretty quickly.

#### For Humanity's Survival in the 21st Century

Or better yet, to ensure we don't just survive, we thrive:
- what is better?
  - to have 1-5 billion people on earth in 2040 to attempt to
    terraform & correct for climate change?
    - this is the beta group
    - lower resource needs ... meh, maybe better chance for
      survival... maybe
  - or to have 8-12 billion people ready to tackle the same problems?
    - as well as whatever kinds of problems humanity will face around
      2040?

#### the beta's (1-5 billion people in 2040)

just think about it: how did these people get here?
- there must have been some massive depopulation event, right? Major
  war, systemic collapse of ecosystem followed by famine, epidemic,
  a technological disaster
  - whatever combination of events decimated half of the worlds
    population in 25 years
    - wouldn't you think that would be traumatic?
    - are the beta's
      - who experienced some combination of events so tragic, they
        create new architypes for worldwide culture (think Noah's
        flood)
      - are they going to be motivated to work hard to face whatever
        challenges ahead of it?
    - no, politics of fear and power emphacizing survival of self and
      opportunism will prevail!
      - a population that experiences something like this is not going
        to be adequately prepared and they may have a mess on their
        hands 100x worse than the world of 2020
- a disaster causing this much death will trigger widespread
  dispair. people will be difficult to motivate, especially in
  groups.
  - there might be a breakdown of established technological systems
    - think breakdown of FCC spectrum regulation
    - some of these things could be fucking terrible
  - in the face of a breakdown of:
    - social/regulatory norms,
    - supply chains,
    - trade,
    - stock/commodity/finance markets,
    - internet,
    - medical infrastructure,
    - technology controls
    - & food supply...
  - how do you think systems like these would fare in a world that
    *somehow* lost half its population in 25 years??....
    - not very well, right?
  - so, in the face widespread chaos and fear, where politics of
    power and opportunism are justified and ethics/values systems
    are forgotten...
    - then how could we possibly rebuild those systems listed above?
    - what kind of leaders is such a world likely to produce?

yeh, it might make for a good mad max sequel, but it's not what I want
my grandchildren to inherit (not that this is going to happen)
- why? because everyone at the top kinda knows: yes depopulation
  relieves stress from mother earth, but ... all in all: IT'D BE A
  FUCKING DISASTER!
  - it would leave 1-5 billion people a legacy of cultural trauma
    requiring a dozen generations to heal.

#### the alpha's (8-12 billion people in 2040)

So, for the survival of humanity, if there are 8-12 billion people,
then IMO that is 8-12 billion chances for impact!  And this is one of
the strongest forces motivating me to pursue a cultural revolution
that transforms our world's population today into a population which
is ready to face such struggles.

- it's because every one of those people alive is a chance for us to
  turn it around.
  - so if a revolution of empowerment sweeps across the globe,
    imagine the kind of combined impact humanity could have on the
    globe.
- Any day: I would prefer the alpha group!
  - 10+ billion invigorated and self-empowered individuals with some
    hard resource constraint problems.
  - over 1-5 billion scared victims of only God knows what, who are
    primarily motivated by fear and self-preservation.
    - the alpha group faced many of the same problems, but they
      prepared and compromised and sacrificed and worked together!!
  - btw, nanotech allows us to scalably expand to space, probably
    by 2030. there's your moonbase! lulz
- and at this point, we can extend our life and reproductive cycle
  with genetic engineering

(more here?)

basically, the question is:
- do we want our children to depend on a population who just went
  through an event with population effects on the level of 15th
  century europe?
  - this is a good parallel: how were the people of the 15th century
    affected by the black plague, culturally?
    - the point is to study this and make people aware of the costs of
      such a tragedy, so that we can avoid the cost of it.
  - these ppl are going to have some issues..
    - if those issues include war, ethnic tension, etc. then that
      means we'll perpetuate that in a time of higher tensions bc of
      resource constraints. thus, are more likely to continue holding
      those grudges further in the future
      - hate gives us more hate. if we experience problems because of
        that at the same time as humanity's greatest crunch (dealing
        with overpopulation) there may be some nations who experience
        pain that never heals
- or would we rather go with the population who didn't tear themselves
  apart with war and spent their resources applying that higher
  population's energy towards building solutions to prepare humanity
  for the 22nd century?
