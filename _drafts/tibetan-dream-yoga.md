### Tibetan Dream Yoga

Most people have heard of lucid dreaming, but not many are aware of its usefulness in evoking insights.  The mindstates of meditation are very similar to those in dreams.  For me, it can be tough to recall what I experience during meditation, except what occurs at the end, right before I fall out.  This is because you're not engaging your cognition to interact with your thoughts.  This is similar to dream where the details of the ending often seem more clear. 

Lucid dreaming is incredibly difficult.  If you're lucky, you'll have a few without having to expending lots of effort.  Though it's definitely worth the work, it involves screwing with your sleep.  One trick is to return to sleep after you initially wake up and I'm really good at that =\ unfortunately. 

Dreams thrust you into situations you'd never face in life.  Sometimes you're faced off against your inner demons and other times, your reliving a juxtaposition of your best moments.  Regardless, dreams can be an invaluable resource for personal development and even moreso, if you can learn to harness them in this way.  Recently, I feel like my brain has been presenting "overlay" dreams, where it's attempting to communicate aspects of it's physical neuronal state using overlaid metaphors I can understand. 

Dreams can be a tool of introspection.  You can learn a lot about yourself by paying more attention to your dreams.  Since we're not usually in a high level of control while dreaming, we can understand more about how our subconscious mind reacts to different situations.  By observing how your mind reacts without your control and by seeking to understand why it takes you to the places it does, you can begin to understand more about your fears, desires, personality, etc.  If you do exhibit control and begin lucid dreaming, then you can consciously create a myriad of situations to test yourself with.  

One particular dream I had that went lucid was set at a music festival.  I was hanging out with lots of my friends and there was so much random stuff to do.  We were all chilling watching a band play on stage.  At one point
