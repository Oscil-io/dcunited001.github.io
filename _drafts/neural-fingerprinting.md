### Neural "Fingerprints"x

ummmm moving on — neural fingerprinting.
- what do i mean by this?
- well in the past 3 or 4 years, i’ve suspected that
  - there is some sort of addressing scheme in the human brain
  - that would allow neurons, or groups of neurons, to target each
    other
  - and direct messages, sort of like IP —
    - ya know, the internet protocol that allows messages to be routed
      to specific computers

- so, it’s recently been shown that each neuron is capable of storing
  and processing information,
  - in addition to being part of a network of information processing
  - that is, the computational capacity of the human brain arises from
    more than just
    - the network configuration of neurons.
    - the neurons themselves are capable of processing info

- so basically, the brain is like a network of reprogrammable FPGA’s
  or ASIC’s
  - where each neuron is capable of information storage and dynamic
    reprogrammable processing

ok, but how would each neuron or each module of neurons specifically
target other neurons?
- and here is where i move into unscientific, hypothetical territory
  - i hope that doesn’t make you too uncomfortable
- what if there’s some random hashed value that is encoded into a
  neurons signal when it fires
  - this “hashed value” would be physically encoded into the neuron
    with some kind of chemical/protein structure
  - and it would result in a consistent “hash” that is encoded into
    the neural signal <airquotes>
  - and this would result in a hash that’s completely random or a kind
    of tree-like hashing with some random
- and so downstream neurons could identify the sender of the message
  with this hash
  - basically it’d be kind of like neural indexing/identity/hashing
    <slash>
  - by statistical comparison of the noise in the signal received

- to propose a mechanism for this neural fingerprinting, i’m just
  going to go with microtubules
  - the microtubule structure in neurons may result in a characteristic value
    - encoded into the signal when the neurons fire.

- i really have like zero evidence for something like this and it may
  be a waste of time to look for it
  - but what else have i been correct about with basically zero evidence?
  - hmmmmm, what else is there again?  bahh i forgot!  oh well

well that’s it!  i’m off to save the world and whatnot
- until then, turn on, tune in, and fucking fix it!
  - i’m not kidding.  don’t drop out.  fix.that.shit.
  - if you see something that can be improved.  fix it.
  - if you see something that was broken, fix it!
  - make.it.right.

Peace!
