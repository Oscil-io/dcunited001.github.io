================================

### general objectives for every policy in the next decade

1. Does this help end poverty?
  - does this minimize specific causes of poverty?
  - does it provide opportunity?
2. Does it strengthen the middle class?
  - instability in the middle class leads to mortages that can't be
    paid, etc, etc. in addition to wealth distribution, this indicates
    economic turbulance
3. Does it anticipate our economy's direction in 5/10 years?
  - and/or does this policy help us foresee where tech is taking us?
  - does the policy help us train the skills we need a decade from
    now?
  - infrastructure investments are a great idea, but we need to be
    aware that new manufacturing techniques and materials will be
    available soon.  we have to start now, so we can't wait, but we
    should be aware of that.
4. Does it promote America's pursuit of happiness?
  - can be rephrased as: how can we make our business, government,
    private and family services more efficient, so that americans can
    focus on the things that matter?
  - Does it help people lead fulfilling lives? Or spend more time with
    their family?
  - Or does it mean that people have to wade through beaurocracy to
    function?
5. Does it strengthen our culture?
  - Does this lead to greater awareness for important issues?
  - Does it help us teach the next generation to teach the values we
    wish were second nature when we were growing up?
  - Does it encourage people to get involved in their community?
  - Does it help promote community activity?
6. How does this policy help bridge the gap for the developing world?
  - How can we extend the opportunities we have here to other
    countries?  (in a way that makes sense for american interests)
    - this is a great tool for leverage in foreign policy (i think)
    - though it's a bit unwieldy
7. Does it provide/promote economic opportunity?
  - How so? Does it provide tax-funded jobs?
8. Does it cause unintended consequences for the economy?
  - how does it affect the operation of private businesses?
  - Does it supplant services provided by private businesses?
9. How does this policy affect medical care of americans?
  - Does this policy lead to lower cost/price of medical care?
  - How does it affect their quality of care and choices?
10. How does the policy affect small businesses in america?
  - small business is really one of the most important factors
    promoting the middle class. wealth spread throughout small
    business means that ownership over american enterprise is spread
    over many households
11. Does it promote or detract from national security?
12. How does it affect how we position ourselves and how we project
    our image to the world?
13. How does it affect foreign policy?
  - Flexibility in foreign policy? Capacity to exert leverage?
14. Does it allow us to maintain a strong military?
15. Is it part of a unified, coherent policy?
  - does the left hand know what the right hand is doing?

================================

(on hillary) i mean i'd feel badly for anyone in that position,
regardless of what they did and especially in contrast to how they act
about what they did. it's not as easy to understand people as it seems
and if they can't assess their own relationships with others honestly,
then it's almost more sad. this entire thing is sooo fucked up

Vote for the best candidate. To me, your vote isn't as important as
why you cast the vote you did. And in our elections, that reasoning
and being vocal about it has the potential for more effect than any
vote or financial contribution ever could. It's that simple.

#Trump is breaking out the Big Tent again. and we're going to unify
America so we can make progress in the world

but we actually need fiscal conservatism, combined with social
liberalism (with the ability forsmall communities to structure their
lives according to religious freedom while respecting the lives/views
of individuals) if we can do that, while unifying America and
retaining a strong military, we're going to be just fine
