Remember Prometheus? Cursed to being a liver-packed bento-box meal for
an Eagle. All day, every day, for eternity. Sounds super fun, right?
Who wouldn't love that?

This article discusses how to apply the principles of architecture to
semiotics and mythology to create worldview-evoking belief systems
robust enough to stand the test of time. Usually, such rare knowledge
requires generations of distillation, like a priceless bottle of wine.
After investing ten minutes in this article, you too can craft your
own belief system that will stand the test of time.

Or at least understand how "they" did it... It all has to do with
semiotics. This is...

# Design of Knowledge Systems

### Robustness of Culture, Preservation of Authenticity, etc

All knowledge and information is will degrade over time. Most worldly
knowledge is nothing without a mind to host it. Therefore, if the
system of developing/spreading knowledge doesn't include a system of
perpetuating its distribution, then it will be impermanent. In
particular, if the system doesn't have some means of handling times of
poor distribution/dispersability of knowledge, then it will almost
certainly fail. This is because it can't handle the inevitable event
where it's nearly eliminated.

On the other hand, one can design knowledge systems whose operation
excels only when there is poor distribution/dispersibility. These
systems are very difficult to root out, because like the Furians of
Riddick, those who have the knowledge gain power upon its near
demise. Therefore the economics of these systems create incentives to
perpetuate the system when it's on its last legs.

How does one become familiar with different systems of knowledge and
culture perpetuation? Like Merlin and the druids of Celt, one accrues
this knowledge over time, by learning to weave ideas and their
semiotic pointers. Is this a skill? Is this a kind of knowledge in
itself? And if so, what is the basis of this skill of knowledge
perpetuation? What are the peculiarities of such skills and systems of
knowledge? How much of history are we missing, if there have always
been massive incentives to keep secret the inner workings of science
and world politics?

IMO, the best place to learn about this is from cultures who went
underground by necessity.  The Celts, the Nords and the Goths are all
perfect examples of cultures who's elements and mythologies were
forced underground as Christianity swept over America. Specifically,
the Nords developed Ragnarok, which is one of many apocalypse myths of
world culture.

IMO: the Nords along with the rest of Europe compromised and agreed to
surpress their pagan history for a united, geopolitically defensible
Europe. But what Ragnarok represents is a literal return of the pagan
gods at the antipated culmination of human history thus far:
overpopulation. Here, the Nords may have intentionally created this
myth as an amalgamtion of other myths in an attempt to conserve what
is essentially a ZIP file of their culture. *The Nords intended their
mythos to be unpacked and their Gods again reified at a critical time
in history.*

Information compression mostly works the same, whether you are
compressing text encoded into tries or compressing hashmaps of some
representation of data, semantic and/or semiotic. You're basically
trying to find a "folding" pattern for the data that makes it small
and compressible.

When applied to cultural mythos, this compression is advantageous:
tightly-packed ideas inspire thought and study to decompress
them. This thought reinforces their longevity within the minds that
host them. Compression also serves as a kind of camoflauge that
protects these ideas and their functioning from competing belief
systems. Compression of these myths makes them more viral, more viable
and more likely to survive knowledge extinction events.

So, cultures like the Norse often rely on myths during time of turmoil
to preserve information in an encoded form. In terms of geopolitics,
they could see which way the wind was blowing in Europe: either Europe
united through Christianity as a cultural basis or Europe would be
economically and geopolitically subservient to the Middle East. They
codified these myths in such a way as to ostensibly retain their
cultural identity while putting together a set of behaviors encoded in
myth, whose execution would begin upon apocalyptic events. Ragnarok is
perhaps the best example of a subversive attempt to use information
compression for cultural preservation.

Still, Ragnarok is more than this. It is pre-literary futurism. It
shows that the ancients knew far more than they are given credit.
Ragnarok symbolizes the end of the world as we know it. Like most
other apocalypse myths from the age of Pisces, the end of the world
symbolizes the changes introduced from exponential population growth.

During Ragnarok, the Norse Gods return one final time. In this myth,
Thor struggles against Jormungand, a snake streching around the
world. This snake is an Ouroborosian symbol, which is critical in
composing an interpretation of what Jormungand represents. Ouroboros
is a snake that grasps its own tail. It's a symbol found in many
esoteric traditions and one that represents a group dynamic where the
strong devour the weak for sustenance and to cleanse the group of
weakness. It's pretty evil.

However, theres another meaning to Jormungand, which lies closer to
another interpretation of Ouroboros: the global economy. But first, if
the snake has curled around the world, then it would be impossible for
the Nords to be unaware of the spherical shape of the world. And, as
the stewards of Thule and Hyperboria, the Nords were perhaps the
people *most* aware of the spherical shape of the world. The Nords
were well-versed in navigation and travelled from close to the Arctic
Circle to close the the equator. **It would be impossible for the
Nords to navigate their corner of earth while being unaware of the
spherical shape of the Earth**.

The previous sentence should be read as: if you know anything about
navigating with 15th century technology, Columbus was a cover story
for incidental genocide. The ignorance of Columbus is the greatest lie
of Western history. The degree to which this lie has been spread
through Western history tells you a lot about the quality and
trustworthiness of historical records themselves: they don't account
for secret and top secret information. Why would the West lie about
America and keep it secret from the time of
[St. Brendan the Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan)?
Because the West didn't want the rest of the world to know that North
America was ripe for the picking. Again, why? Because western maritime
navigability was inferior until the era before the Renaissance.

So... Columbus is a lie, partly to cover genocide. *WOOPS WE DIDN'T
MEAN TO!!* ... It was an "accident" and nothing more. Do you feel any
better? What about the rest of history? How many teachers in America
will look you in the eye and tell you the story of Columbus? So,
before this is all finished, the rest of the Illuminati's secrets will
be revealed. And no, this ain't no !@#$'ing Youtube documentary. And
the Illuminati always knew that the time would could when all their
sins throughout history would be out in open air in front of
everyone. It's not like they didn't see it coming. And it's not like
they can't justify their dirty laundry: they all know it and they hate
themselves. It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.

- There are 3 monsters: a land, sea and air monster (sound
  familiar?)
  - the sea monster is Jormungand, the snake
  - the land monster is Fenrir, the wolf
  - third monster (maybe i'm off on this?)
- Thor is poisoned by jormungand's bite, but successfully
    destroys him

### Ragnarok was pre-literary futurism

- Back to the point at hand: IMO Jormungand symbolizes global trade
  and Ragnarok occurs at a time when trade is global and when
  modernism threatens to homogenize all culture.
  - the authors of Ragnarok finally wrote it down (in the Poetic
    Edda?) during a time of cultural turmoil
  - in other words, they knew their culture would disappear and that
    the Christian persecutions of western Europe would spread
    northward.
    - to some degree the most influential Nords may have been in
      agreement with utilizing Christianity to solidify Europe against
      Islam and any other major cultural movements from the Middle
      East.
    - these people were aware of Islam (again, they fought in the
      greatest road trip of the middle ages: the 2nd Crusades, circa
      end of 11th century)
      - they even brought back islamic jewelry from the middle east,
        which apparently baffled archaeologists for some time. there
        was a ring with arabic inscriptions found at a nordic burial
        site or something.

### Europe has always been obsessed with geopolitical cultural unity

- amoung others with political influence at the time -- think
  pre-Charlemagne Gaul (~7th century) through Medici Italy
  (15th century)
  - they would have been aware that, as long as Europe remained
    culturally united on the basis of Christianity, it would be much
    more capable of handling external threats, regardless of the
    consequences of internal conflict.
  - but the second that Islam crept in the back door (via
    people's minds, etc) and gained significant geopolitical
    foothold from within Europe, this would be a major
    problem.
    - this is because of the geopolitical and economic situation
      during the dark/middle ages: Europe's imports/exports were
      tightly coupled to trade in the middle east.
    - as long as Europe and the Middle East remained geographically
      and politically independent, that trade fostered prosperity in
      both Europe and the Middle East
      - but if either Europe or the Middle East were to obtain
        complete dominance over the region, that balanced &
        well-intentioned prosperity would give way to a system whereby
        either:
      - Europe becomes isolated & impovershed or the Middle East loses
        the ability to profit from Silk Road trade in its region
        - the entireity of 5,000 years of history can be accurately
          summarized by simply looking at the Silk Road, the economics
          of each region trading on it, and the politics of whoever
          controlled specific regions of it

### Neo-Ragnarok

### And Cultural Engineering

- ugh, major sidetrack... again, back to Ragnarok. IMO, with little
  substantial evidence, I think the Nordic religions wanted to unite
  and preserve cultural elements and predictions of the far future in
  their mythos via a written version of the Poetic Edda & Ragnarok
  - but if one were to do this today -- and especially in the face of
    likely persecution of believers:
  - what would we choose to preserve?
- how would we abstract/obfuscate that so that it maintains
  authenticity, resillience to external
  subversion/manipulation/persecution, etc?
- and, if we can foresee events in the future for which our
  descendents may lose the knowledge/tools to comprehend,
  then how do we preserve the authenticity of that
  prediction?
  - especially when it needs to be obscured to protect the
    interests of the people preserving the message in the face
    of persecution
    - but they...

### The Shepherd as a Universal Symbol

a well-recognized symbol for religions is that of the shepherd. Jesus
was a shepherd, which was well known through out the middle east and
other adjacent areas.
- it was a humble role in society, where one person was entrusted with
  ensuring the safety and vitality of a flock. I imagine that, in many
  cases, this livestock was an asset that belonged to someone else in
  most cases.
  - but this symbol of the shepherd was universally recognized. a
    shepherd might operate differently in various regions, but there
    are some aspects of his duties and responsibilities that were
    shared by all cultures with agriculture & livestock
    - a shepherd tends to animals & livestock
    - a shepherd must fend off threats to the livestock
    - a shepherd can manage his flock to feed it well or feed it
      poorly. in the longterm, this can lead to a healthy flock or one
      that is malnourished.
    - the shepherd might herd animals specific to a region, but there
      are common pieces of information shared across all of those
      regions.
  - the shepherd is also a well known symbol in several major world
    religions. it's present in Judaism, in Christianity, in Buddhism,
    in Islam, and to a limited degree in Zoroastrianism.

- in Mahayana Buddhism, there are 3 degrees of bodhisattva, depending
  on how their words/actions express their beliefs:
  - the King: who strives for Buddhahood as soon as possible as a
    means of self-empowerment to help others
  - the Boatman or Ferryman: who strives for Buddhahood along with
    other sentient beings (to ensure they reach the other side)
  - the Shepherd: who strives for Buddhahood, but only under the
      condition that all other sentient beings have achieved
      Buddhahood.
    - The shepherd is the "highest" bodhisattva, who has vowed remain
      behind for the longest time and make the greatest personal
      sacrifices.
    - one might say this is the greatest sacrifice, as one must
      acknowledge the all-but-ensured lack of personal attainment of
      Buddhahood, since it would be a pipe-dream to think all sentient
      lifeforms could become Buddha.
- but the symbol of the shepherd is one that appears in four or five
  major religions. it has universal appeal, understanding, etc.

### Semiotics of Mythology

If you're using semiotics to encode meaning in mythology by mapping
universally relevant symbols to meanings then:

- How do you know which symbols to choose?
  - generally universal recognition trumps everything else, but
    there's lots of stuff that's universally relevant:
    - water, food, sleep, hunger, greed, money, etc
    - how do you map this stuff and what's the best way to map it?
    - there is even a list of about 100 universally shared traits,
      which are common even to Amazonian cultures which are completely
      isolated
    - there is a varied degree of universal recognition. to some
      degree, you want those symbols to be more relevant to your
      culture.
      - universally relevant symbols are useful in that they are
        marketable and brandable, but that trade-off is balanced
        because they also provide additional surface area for
        cultural subversion.
- Which symbols will most resist semiotic change (change in meaning or
  signs) over time. Why?
  - how is this so completely different in our digital world.
    - and how to harness this?
- What systems of symbols will resist change in the face of constantly
  changing culture?
  - In the face of cultural turmoil before, during and after
    modernism/globalism?
- And in the face of some possibly permanent, transformative event,
  such as the Singularity?
  - this event, if possible or if certain, could be transforming
    culture and human behavior now.  Similar to the Roko Basilisk, the
    idea itself has immense power.

- and if almost every human need/desire/norm will change during the
  next few decades, how do we decide what to preserve?
  - how do we preserve it in such a way that is robust?
  - in such a way that resists the potential for abuse of religion?
  - in alignment with the values of humanism?

I'm sure there are Theology PhD's all over the world that have written
dissertations on this topic or similar ones. Studying Ragnarok would
be Eschatology and there's probably a name for this such study.

- signs & morphemes from zipf's distribution on language.
  - and also signs
- top 500 words/morphemes to learn in any new language are a great
  start for enumerating a list of mappable symbols


# Examples of Systems of Symbols

So when constructing myths, what are examples of systems of signs,
symbols, etc? Any set of signs common to a culture, nation or region
can be mapped to multiple meanings. This is true of a signs to a
varying degree of frequency.

### Astrology

Perhaps the most constant set of `signs` in the semiotic sense, this
was the only strata of phenomena which was completely constant to
pre-historic man. The weather was seasonal and varied. Children were
born young and died before old age. Previous generations left their
mark, but it faded fast. Stories and myths could be lost. Even the
earth changed from time to time, but the stars were the only thing
that never, ever changed, though it would have been difficult to
verify to any degree of certainty. The pursuit of understanding the
inner workings of celestial bodies -- their usefulness in regard to
navigation and determining geography and eventually in profiting from
commerce -- doubtlessly inspired measurement, quantification, the
transmission of knowledge, and its maintainance.  Around the time we
began to explore more complicated verbal language, how would one
explain to someone else the constant nature of stars? How would
someone prove that? How can one prove something in the physical world
is constant without measuring it? Those questions likely lead us to
pursue monolithic works and eventually architecture. Anything which
broke from the constant nature of the stars would have been perceived
as incredibly important. e.g. planets and supernovae.

Furthermore, as a set of signs, astrology is unique across the world
.. to a degree. The northern and southern hemispheres experience
things differently and different stars are visible at different points
in the year.

The developments of primordial astrology, commerce, agriculture and
architecture were incredibly important to humanity's development from
a phenomenological perspective. Each of these represent a paradigm
shift in humanity's understanding of how we related to the
world. Astrology represents our ability to make measurements. Commerce
represents our ability to understand need and desire, to coordinate
human activity and to intentionally precipitate social hierarchy, and
to reward innovation. Agriculture represents a paradigm shift in how
we could live and separated humanity from limiting its food source to
that provided by nature and thus, eliminated many constraints on our
suitable geographic environments.  Architecture represents a
transformation in how humanity relates to our world: we began to see
the effects or greatness of those who came before us; we developed an
understanding of legacy and perhaps some kind of dominance over death;
we understood that we could separate ourselves from the dangers of the
natural world. After these four elements came the economic need for
written language and law.

### Math and Science

Another set of fairly or very constant signs are mathematical and
scientific truths and laws, though these didn't arise quite as early
as those signs from astrology. These require a priori knowledge to
have much significance or the capacity for transmission without
communication. If you learn enough and look often enough, you'll find
that everything is more than it seems at the surface. What lies
beneath can be very useful, but is often confusing and more trouble
than its worth.

### Architypical Events in Human History

- the creation of the world
  - and the proposed solution to the problem of evil
  - every religion needs to explain a beginning, somehow
    - even tribal societies passed down oral traditions of a
      beginning.
  - because the story of a beginning is itself a universal facet of
    human culture, then it itself is a symbol.
- calamitous events (Noah's Flood, etc)
  - Noah's Flood is a deep rooted architypical event which serves to
    provide each new generation with an understanding that humanity &
    civilization are impermanent. In the Judeo-Christian tradition,
    the story of Noah's Flood reminds us that we exist at the grace of
    God.

### Architypical Events/Phenomena in the Human Experience

- birth and death
  - everyone has a birth
  - everyone has a death
  - everyone can relate to these things
  - and ... everyone has a v-card
- hunger & thirst
- virginity (& purity)
- right and wrong

### Human Relationships (Family/Friendship)

- family relationships are shared by almost everyone.
  - lack of father/mother/parents produces some of the
    highest-magnitude shifts in a person's psychology
    - lack of presence or loss of a parent produces similarly dramatic
      shifts in a person's psychology
  - those relationships are at least known to everyone
    - father, mother, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, grandparents
    - they might mean different things to different people in various
      cultures, but the presence of these signs as mapple in terms of
      semiotics is universal
  - and family relationships are a set of symbols with profound
    strength.
    - even if someone is reading about the father/mother of Zeus or
      Persephone or Heracles, there is a subtle profundity influenced
      by factors such as family relationships which molds the lens
      through which we experience those stories

- perhaps distubingly, this is a set of symbols which could be erased!
  - think Brave New World, where children have state imposed family.
    - artificial reproduction supplants familial relationships of
      biological origin
  - Orwellian assaults on family are real. A tyrannical government
    will leap straight for the corrosion of the family as the
    strongest set of relationships in nearly every individual's life
    - this isn't new: it was life-as-usual in Greek Sparta
      - some Spartan's were separated from their family at birth and
        raised as ruthless soldiers
  - we are seeing this to some degree now and we need to be prepared
    because an overreaching government evolving towards tyranny *will*
    seek to undermine family.
    - it's not methodic or systematic now, but it very well could be.
    - God help us if we let tyrants get away with it!!

### Animals & Animal Behavior

### Plant Life

#### Medical Uses, Geographic Distribution, Cultural Significance and Plant Interaction

#### Agriculture

### Psychology & Psychiatry

- in the case of modern society, psychology and psychiatry can be
  mapped in to a language.
  - this is really what the occult and system of magick were about.
  - creating systems that could map to features and phenomena in the
    human mind, in an attempt to control them.

### Weather Events

- rain, drought, etc
- these are less likely to be completely universal, but there
  presence/absence is mappable via semiotics.
  - and again, for millenia, people have reached for mythology as a
    means of explaining these phenomena.
    - even if they believed a myth about the Great Flood in the Epic
      of Gilgamesh to be false, they still derived useful information
      from mythology about that event or about flooding and how it
      could affect people
      - therefore a total assault on religion or an extinction of
        mythology/religion will lead to a humanity that is inherently
        less equipped to deal with life, people, cultures and events
        (common & rare)

### Health/Disease/Anatomy


### Human Behavior

- emotions, emotional progressions
- eating, sex, things that every person must do

### Misc Phenomena

... Everybody Poops
