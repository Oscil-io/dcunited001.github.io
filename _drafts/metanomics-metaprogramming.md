- is there a good example from the epigenetics class?
- again, another good example?

- some cells modify their own genomes to augment behaviors
  - genomic process for copy & pasted genes
    - is there a genomic mechnanism for preventing bad writes?
    - some writes would have almost no effect on genetic expression of
      critical factors
    - some writes would be disastrous for that generation or the
      subsequent generation
    - some writes would be disastrous for all subsequent generations
      of cells
- or modify the available mRNA & their rates of transcription into
  protein products
  - miRNA, piRNA?
    - these ramp up or inhibit the available mRNA's that are to be
      produced into protein products

establish the overall theme and tie each part back to how it
reinforces this theme
- genetics is a program where loops and trees of behavior can be
  predictably triggered
  - so go through examples from epigenetics and explain how they
    reinforce/demostrate/utilize this idea

how to structure this series of articles?

article about predictive medicine and CYP450
- this article might be a good start for probabilistic theory
  - but how to measure this?
  - explain why the expression of genetics has a much greater effect
    than the encoding of alleles in the genes, usually

- hmmmmm, there was like one other example of probabilistic
  programming theory of metanomics
  - neural fingerprints
