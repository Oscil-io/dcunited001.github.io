- is there a good example from the epigenetics class?
- again, another good example?

- reconstruction of realistic epigenetic marker values from fossils up
  to 5,000 years old?
  - it MAY be possible. basically, we'd have to have enough well
    preserved (ice-frozen or peat-bog preserved) to have a ton of data
    to sample from, along with a common map for expected values on
    genes.
  - so, basically the idea is to compare epigenetic data assumed to be
    highly erroneous with a methylation epigenome assembled today.

    - if it's possible there's mostly no way it'd work for histone
      values. i'm not sure if those can be sampled cheaply &
      non-invasively today
    - but WHAT IF it's possible for *some* DNA methylation.
    - it should be possible, especially in context of some epigenomic
      maps for tissue.
      - you can compare the methylation epigenome for different tissue
        types today with the methylation scanned in from various
        tissue types from some well-preserved sample like the iceman
      - because we know what the expected range of variation in tissue
        types is b/w

- some cells modify their own genomes to augment behaviors
  - genomic process for copy & pasted genes
    - is there a genomic mechnanism for preventing bad writes?
    - some writes would have almost no effect on genetic expression of
      critical factors
    - some writes would be disastrous for that generation or the
      subsequent generation
    - some writes would be disastrous for all subsequent generations
      of cells
- or modify the available mRNA & their rates of transcription into
  protein products
  - miRNA, piRNA?
    - these ramp up or inhibit the available mRNA's that are to be
      produced into protein products

establish the overall theme and tie each part back to how it
reinforces this theme
- genetics is a program where loops and trees of behavior can be
  predictably triggered
  - so go through examples from epigenetics and explain how they
    reinforce/demostrate/utilize this idea

how to structure this series of articles?

article about predictive medicine and CYP450
- this article might be a good start for probabilistic theory
  - but how to measure this?
  - explain why the expression of genetics has a much greater effect
    than the encoding of alleles in the genes, usually

- hmmmmm, there was like one other example of probabilistic
  programming theory of metanomics
  - neural fingerprints
