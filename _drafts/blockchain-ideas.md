- Blockchain X Medium
  - blogging platform that preserves authenticity/authorship of text
    and makes it difficult to implement changes in the future
  - what else was the point of this?

- alternate coin systems actually seem like the could be big in 2020
  as a kind of auth-by-postage stamp
  - this is more custom blockchain development though (not coins or
    currencies)
  - this is already happening (but i am basically not allowed to
    participate in technology -- only psych. torture for me lulz)
    - R3 is getting $150 million in investment and works with a couple
      dozen major financial institutions to implement a global ledger
      for high-speed transactions with decentralized authorization)

- however, other disruptive technologies could disrupt the need or use
  of blockchains. for example, QN DISRUPTS EVERYTHING!

- blockchain and carbon tax are at odds with each other...
  - or they could be ... who knows?
  - blockchain adds hashing and crypto at all levels. it makes
    everything super secure, but adds a lot of computational
    complexity, which is bad
  - therefore, blockchain adds a need for energy
    - security ~ energy tradeoff

- it's trivial to add URL's and data pointers to blockchain hashing
  - it's easy to add pointers for data stored in NoSQL, etc.
  - blockchain as a dimension of data (in terms of design with
    object-relational design)
  - blockchain will be viewed as foundational (but not for everything)
    - the trade-off is computation time (obviously)

- selling pre-mined currency forms?
  - Arscoin, etc
  - is it possible to precompute and recompute blockchains?
    - i don't actually know how these hashing alg's work. i'm pretty
      sure it's not possible to quickly do this.
    - as in, precompute one set of coins and then have the ability to
      use a different starting value and instantly retrieve a new
      blockchain that can be used

- manipulating the sequencing of financial transactions to get
  preferential sequencing/pricing for trades?
  - can slow down an adversary by affecting the routing/consensus of a
    financial blockchain
  - this is very complicated and involves compromised telecom routers
    and compromised networks, but is possible, given the decentralized
    nature of blockchain consensus
  - it's not likely that one can do this and have the time/control to
    influence the pricing in a known, controllable, advantageous
    manner
  - this is a great plot idea for a new Office Space movie because
    it's kind of like the Superman 3 hack.
