- there are some things ancient people understood more clearly than we
  do today.


### [Marathon and Thermopylae](#marathon-and-thermopylae)

At the battle of Marathon, the Greeks defeated the Persians. News of
this victory was so critical that Pheidippides ran over twenty miles
to bear news of it's victory. Every marathon you run is part of a
millenia-old celebration of being the first to deliver a message.

What's the value of a message? How does cheap and free transmission
affect us? How does it lead to progress? The power of a simple message
unimpeded can change the course of civilizations. At Thermopylae, the
brave acts of hundreds of Spartans struck fear into the heart of
Persians and funneled vigor into the hearts of Greeks to rise up and
resist the oncoming hordes. Would this envigorating effect have been
possible if not for the story? What if it couldn't be told?

### (democratic tradition in greece)

During the first millinea B.C., a confluence of Greek
technology, culture and geography, encouraged a philosophic
exploration of human life. In particular, the Greek city-states
flourished at a time where reflection on the structure of society
itself was encouraged, where its evolution occured at a rapid pace and
operated long enough without being domineered by an external
force. This itself wasn't unique, but we managed to maintain their
literary tradition. In doing so, we preserved the best record this
phenomenon in Western history.

# 

In the ancient world, population growth and movement was tightly
coupled to economic opportunity, constrained by resources, and bounded
by geography. Population quantity drives the total quantity of
information and increases rate at which innovations occur via the
network effect. Population density increases the rate at which
information moves in those sociophysical networks.

Imagine humans as particles with random motion whose individual speed
of vibration depends on available vehicles of transit, intended
destination, resource distribution and other factors. The particles
vibrate in patterns, almost certainly originating from some home point
and returning to it every day. When these particles hit the ocean at a
port, they accelerate like sound hitting a solid barrier, assuming
these people have ships and sails.

<a name="thermal-convection-of-information" />

### [Thermal Convection of Information](#thermal-convection-of-information)

Imagine the sun rising in the Far East. It heats up the air and water,
giving us wind and ocean currents, but doesn't its sociophysical
energy also reverberate through humanity? As the world turns each day,
there is random motion moving from the east to the west, driving
social interactions. Pushing through the noise are faint, low
frequency waves of cultural information rippling over and reflecting
between geographic features. Vacuums of low population density tapers
this resonance. Between the centers of civilization, the dispersion of
information is strained through translingual membrane, limiting the
number of social connections over which information can cross. These
metaphors are not perfect, as behavior was not coordinated and our
modes of transportation were limited throughout history.

<a name="humanitys-measures-of-connectedness-vary-geographically" />

### [Humanity's Measures of Connectedness Vary Geographically](#humanitys-measures-of-connectedness-vary-geographically)

Consider the human population distribution of 5,000 BC. At this time,
we had dispersed from Africa through the Middle East and around the
Black Sea to India, Europe, China, Indonesia and the Americas. At that
time, was there a region more connected than others? The most
connected region was the Middle East. And people less connected?
Those in island nations or beyond the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn,
both of which would incidentally be more likely to understand the
spherical shape of the earth.

### (Middle east as the old world's maximum of connectivity)

As for the Middle East, its high degree of connection, its proximity
to geographic chokepoints and its access to large swaths of ocean
surface area gave it an almost unparalleled economic advantage, which
only grew as time marched on. This region had the shortest actual
distance to the most number of people, and access to the largest
social graph neighborhoods, depending on how you measured it. When
people are more widely spread out, it is more rare to have large 2nd
and 3rd degree networks, which conferred major advantages. Those with
wealth could finance transport and delegate action, which further
helped expand those networks.

### North Korea as a global minimum of connectivity

- how this leads to poor decisions by the leadership and reduces their
  economic competitiveness
  - if you look at the social graph, the 2-degree neighborhoods of
    north korean citizens have fewer international connections than
    any other country.
    - how can you compete in the global economy if your regime
      prohibits communiction with the outside?
    - how can you export products if your citizens cannot freely
      establish relationships with people and businesses in other
      countries? in spite of UN sanctions, the regime really shoots
      their potential development of exports (in the foot)
    - in a digital economy, products are informational. NK citizens
      simply can't be consumers or producers of content. AFAIK, they
      aren't allowed to have radios because NK paranoia is stuck with
      the 1960's soviet mindset of information control.
      - no hardware for internet, no media creation tools, no content
        production, no culture export, no connections developed,
        interactions are discouraged.

### America and Europe as a connectivity maximum today

- what kind of advantage does permeability and connectivity give us?
  why can this also be a vulnerability?
  - what are advantages/vulnerabilities of diversity?

# (Social Physics Overview)

Sociophysical systems are usually too complex to yield truly
scientific evidence, these metaphors and metrics are invaluable tools
yielding philosophic insights. They sharpen our inductive reasoning
for social behavior and history, giving us options that will yield
concrete scientific evidence. Most social systems modeled with
physical components are incomputable, but computational social science
is harnessing these ideas today. (cite study)

### (Intractibility)

Information has a life of its own and nowhere does this become more
clear than in social physics, which is a mathematical framework for
modeling idealized social behavior with physical constraints. (It's
mind blowing, but the bad news is) that almost every problem is
incomputable. Incredibly useful insights can be extrapolated from a
philosophic exploration of social physics.

###

Social physics was originally developed in the 19th century (links?)
to quantify sociological situations and particularly how the behavior
of players in social games are affected by the imposition of physical
constraints. It originally borrowed heavily from classical mechanics
and now overlaps with quantum mechanics, since non-deterministic games
are loaded with probabilistic mechanics. Social physics can help us
understand team sports, advanced
[swarm behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour), the
geometric mechanics of battle tactics, cocktail parties and the finer
mysteries of feng shui. Each of those activities (determined by the
physics of the space) space and players in a social game with rules,
though with feng shui, the game and players may be less clearly
defined.

If you begin modeling games where players have their own sets of
information, social physics is rendered irrevocably and hopelessly
incomputable, almost immediately. Each additional layer presents its
own challenges of tractibility and data structure countability.
Simulations that can be parallelized with a GPU have tight information
schema requirements. Knowing this, how do you identify what can be
modeled and made known? How do you structure an organization's
logistics and data collection requirements to efficiently model social
phenomena and information dynamics? What's the difference between what
can be simulated and what can be inferred via data science.?

#### &#x2605; Do the players contain their own copies of information or is it shared?

#### &#x2605; Do instances of information adhere to a defined schema shared among all players?

#### &#x2605; Can the information schema be modified?

#### &#x2605; Can the information be known in totality for the game?

#### &#x2605; Can a player access their own information in totality or reflect on its schematic structure?

#### &#x2605; Do players need to make inferences based on the information schemas of other players?

From the above, it isn't clear which adds the most complexity, but
players almost always operate with incomplete understanding in social
situations. They can do so effectively because they've been
conditioned to develop sets of proactive and reactive behaviors that
(...).  Information overload can negatively affect players. The
(questions) pertaining to information schema and information
reflection add an incomprehensibly infinite degree of complexity. For
the mathemtaticians, yes, modifiable schemas with or without
reflection are definitely uncountable.

All of this means that players have to be good at handling
information, but better at balancing uncertainy and risk with
goal-seeking behavior. If the game being modeled is soccer or some
other team sport, there are subtle sociophysical aspects that can
vastly improve team performance, such as ensuring visibility and other
mechanics of communication. If the team works together and can share
its understanding of the state of the field, this can help immensely
with coordinating tactics.

There are other physical aspects of soccer which are also modeled by
social physics, such as the typical FIFA 2017 stats: speed, energy,
skill, etc. The best players in the world can play together, but
unless they can read each other and anticipate the coordination of
tactics with limited signaling, the games will be reduced to the more
physical stats and positioning.

Social physics is distinguished from physics and simple models of
swarm behavior by providing a framework where players react to
informational components and dynamics emerging from information. (This
also stands out from simple probabilistic models for social behavior
with its focus on the spatial components and particle interactions.)

- TODO: decide whether to move up the section on sociophysical metrics
  - and decide whether to move up the physics metaphors (its too long)

<a name="postulates-of-sociophysical-systems" />

# [Postulates of Sociophysical Systems](#postulates-of-sociophysical-systems)

Extrapolating from a basic assessment of the math, there are
implications and ramifications that attain preponderance, standing
above everything else. By failing to fully understand sociophysical
phenomena, by stubbornly clinging to some idealistic mode (...) or by
refusing to allow adaptation to them, we fall victim to Nietzche's
danger of dangers.

- include a description of fields, the structure of which influences
  the flow of energy
  - fields can have physical or (virtual) topological spaces

<a name="types-of-sociophysical-energy-have-both-linear-and-non-linear-mechanics" />

### (1) [Types of Sociophysical Energy Have Both Linear And Non-Linear Mechanics, Which Determine Their Equivalence and Interaction Dynamics](#types-of-sociophysical-energy-have-both-linear-and-non-linear-mechanics)

- Their mechanics are both Linear and non-linear
  - this creates interactions and equivalence dynamics
  - it is rare that energy is perfectly preserved, never created nor destroyed

- of energy equilalence, governing movement and transduction
- There varying metrics and means of equivalence for the movement of Energy
  - these forms of energy are moving across various kinds of spaces

- what is universal among all the types of energy? anything?
- examples of types of energy

<a name="power-is-defined-as-the-rate-of-energy-fluxing-through-sociophysical-networks" />

### (2) [Power Is Defined As The Rate of Energy Fluxing Through Sociophysical Networks](#power-is-defined-as-the-rate-of-energy-fluxing-through-sociophysical-networks)

Similar to power in electrical networks, sociophysical measures of
power are defined as the potential to trigger flux through social
networks and the rate of that flux. There are many varieties of flux
that can be projected through types of social networks: physical
change, informational change, structural change to graphs,
informational or schematic change, and behavioral change.

- change to the structure of ideas or to shape people's conception of
  them
  - history as a language of ideas we build upon
  - controlling the truth allows you to constrain the form of context
    in the minds of others

- (here, focus on imagery related to electrical systems)

- (the forms above) are higher-order. that is, what we see IRL are
  really combinations of the above:
  - informational change that results in physical change
  - informational change that results in eventual schematic change on
    a social scale
  - behavior change that results in long-term physical changes
  - physical changes that result in informational changes
  - schematic change that results in self-perpetuating changes over
    the course of years, decades or centuries (i.e. religion)

<a name="social-power-depends-on-potentials-for-types-of-energy-flux" />

### (3) [Social Power Depends On Potentials For Types Of Energy Flux, Each Actual And Perceived](#social-power-depends-on-potentials-for-types-of-energy-flux)

- this potential for flux/action is very much dependent on the beliefs
  of nodes in the system and a differential of information available
  to the nodes.
  - that is, if there is already complete disemination of some pieces
    of information to a set of nodes, you have reduced or lost the
    capacity to influence those nodes through the disemination of that
    information
    - this is overly simplified because, again, everything is a
      lower-order conjugation of the above higher-order forms
    - differential equations

  - but the social graph that emerges on top of physically interacting
    particles (idealized people) in a social system functions very
    much like an electrical network
    - in this way, power and information function similarly to
      voltage, amperage, gates, etc, albeit in an extremely-high
      dimensional way
    - math problems that are extremely high in dimension or infinitely
      dimensional function in radically different ways
      - this often studied as the curse of dimensionality and it's
        implications in various areas of math diverge widely

### (4) Perceived Beliefs feedback into social power (...)

In this way, belief and perception can almost independently create
types of energy.

### (5) [Agents Have Varying Degrees Of Autonomy, Individual Definitions Of Energy Types and Share Traits, Such As Concurrency, Bandwidth and Physicality]()

- a second critical factor is the lack of multitasking:
  - particles (at least people) can only really do one thing & can
    only think one thing at a time, which bounds how quickly state
    changes can occur
    - this doesn't apply to automonous agents operating on virtual
      channels, which are so far almost completely bound to aphysical
      manisfestations
  - similarly, people are bound to one place at a time

<a name="mechanics-of-social-interactions-and-connections-are-physical-and-logical-but-increasingly-virtualized" />

### (6) [Mechanics of Social Interactions And Connections Are Physical and Logical, But Increasingly Virtualized](#mechanics-of-social-interactions-and-connections-are-physical-and-logical-but-increasingly-virtualized)

- Information, energy and social power flow through networks.

Electrical networks are an example of physical phenomena with a
logical graph-based structure overlayed on top. In reasoning about
these systems and the range of possibilities, the resulting dynamics
and mechanics are neither purely physical or purely logical. Only by
reasoning about the systems, logically and with (increasing)
structure, can we reach (a maximum of phenomenological flexibility)

- "social circuitry"
  - metaphors for social influence as electrical networks where all
    components are connected. disrupting any power flow disrupts all
    power flows.
  - quote nietszche on power/influence flow in "twilight of the gods"
  - one way & two way directions of comm. protocols (diodes)

- many networks superimposed onto other, more primary, phsyical and
  aphysical networks

- computer chips are then the physical (manisfestations) of metaphysical primatives
  - they are logic made manifest, capable of virtualizing physical systems.

Sociophysical systems are (very similar).

<a name="to-hedge-against-domain-complexity-agents-amplify-perceived-beliefs" />

### (7) [To Hedge Against Domain Complexity, Agents Amplify Perceived Beliefs And Interact In Other Ways](#to-hedge-against-domain-complexity-agents-amplify-perceived-beliefs)

- fragile & antifragile:

- fragility &
  [antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility) of
  sociophysical systems
  - e.g. the tendancy to amplify beliefs & perceived beliefs to
    encourage consensus and discourage divergent beliefs/behavior
  - but in systems theory, agents with more influence over the system
    receive higher quality information.
    - further, proactive means of generating dynamics in the system
      allows agents to interrogate their environment, making
      inferences about the true beliefs of other agents in the system
      or about information they have access to

- agents cannot operate with total information. instead, they
  consciously and unconsciously find ways to hedge against complexity
  - dimensionality reduction(?) and numeric approximation to analytic
    solutions are both relevant here

### (8) The context of some agents is predominately accumulated by a (sum of experience determined by directed focus)

- so, directing their focus changes the range of experiential
  information relevant to their context. combined with signaling and
  especially with (decision models), this easily can have
  multiplicative effects.

- examples of using this?

### (9) decoherence of information/knowledge reduces... (ability to model the system)

- the single most important conclusion I can draw from a mathematical
  assessment of social physics is that the ability to make valid
  assumptions on information/beliefs and the behaviors of nodes is
  unparalleled
  - if you cannot do these things, you cannot expect to predict
    specific or general behavior and you cannot expect to extrapolate
  - it's like trying to predict the motion of particles while
    turbulently mixing a fluid containing random quantities of
    molecules composed by every element. each has its mean ways of
    moving, whereas social particles with consistent schema are more
    predictable, almost like crystals.
  - sociophysically, soldiers in a greek phalanx have the same kind of
    crystalline aspects to their information schema. because they have
    been imbued with the information & information schemata of their
    training, they can anticipate how each other filters information
    and anticipate each other's actions.

- religion is an attempt to hedge against domain complexity by
  creating a primary schema of information shared amongst a
  sufficiently large set of agents
  - because such a large set of agents respond to information in
    similar ways ...

- the inability to scalably model or to even ascertain pieces of
  information, which are sometimes unindexable if no rigid schema can
  be devised, means that the way in which information is handled in
  these models becomes infinitely more important
  - i.e. convergence and homogeneity of belief systems is required to
    make *any* useful inferences and those aspects of the systems
    which cause schematic divergence become problematic

### (10) Evolutionary Dynamics of Social Physics (Build on) Programs in Chaos

- (rewrite this section, since i can reference the article on chaos)
- briefly(!) what is probabilistic programming (is it chaos computing
  or programming with chaotic systems)
  - it's like a means of modeling/studying chaotic systems where the
    systems constituents begin to impose order on the system.
  - under what situations would a chaotic system begin to exhibit
    components of itself that can "create order out of chaos" ?

- there are ideas from probabilistic programming at both macro and
  micro levels. the micro refers to the each how particle informs its
  structures its view of the world and informs its actions.
  - but then there are ideas from probabilistic programming at work at
    higher levels of organization. here, the particles interact
    similar to how atoms/molecules interact in genetics.
    - here, the analogy of spatially distributed state is more apparent.

- social physics can be Modeled with ideas from machine learning
  - each parti Boltzmann Machine
  - and/or perhaps other ideas from machine learning

- explain what a [boltzmann machine]() is.
  - i'm going to need to refresh
  - a boltzmann machine makes small changes to values over a very long
    time (i think...) and is computationally prohibitive in all most
    all circumstances (or at least is usually an inefficient way to
    solve a problem)
  - agents are like their own boltzmann machine processes
    - it's more complicated than this because they are recognizing and
      emulating behavior types, not simply representations of
      information

### (11) [Disruption of Connections & Interactions Alters Flow Of Energy & Power, Physically, Logically and Virtually](#disruption-of-connections-and-interactions-alters-flow-of-energy-and-power-physically-logically-and-virtually)


### (12) Social, Financial and other flows indicate frequency and value of connections and interactions (Interest & Intent)

- laplacian of these flows and their aggregates, geographically &
  logically, indicate intent

### (13) Intent is also Signified by Parallel, Anti-Parallel and Orthogonal Orientations of Motion as it relates to Laplacian of High-Dimensional Surfaces, Even When Hidden

- this helps indicate intent, even when it was hidden
  - consistency is hard to fake, any duplicity exacerbates this and
    displays itself as partial consistency, which ultimately serves to
    highlight cognizance of intent

- (Cut in content/ideas from facets: systems theory draft)

### (14) Everything is a particle. Everything is a Wave. Even Information

- the particle/wave duality also fits the holonic model of information
  - information in social physics should be modelable as waves,
    communicated among players in social games, idealized as
    particles)
  - social phenomena can be modeled with social physics, but almost
    everything is incomputable.
  - however, similar to how there are many kinds of interactions
    between particles and waves, interactions in social physics can be
    understood with infinite dimensional waves
    - however, the structure of information infinite and unknowable

### (15) Independence and Connectedness Are Quantifiable

- (title: Connectedness and Social Isolation can be Measured?)

- social isolation/connectedness (in/dependence and vulnerability)
- this isn't really something considering almost axiomatic, which
  definitely describes the other two...
- third: social isolation is quantifiable and almost always correlates
  with power. more isolated, less empowered.
  - isolated individuals are more susceptable to manipulation

- social isolation can be measured, given some "normal" facebook
  user's 2-degree graph of friends for some definition of normal
  (casual but regular) social media usage
  - filter the friends by strength of connection to indentify edges
    sending and receiving inbound and outbound messages/interactions
    - measure the degree of reciprication and the variety of people
      forming the strongest recent connections
    - filter out all connections which do not fit some minimum of
      interaction threshold
    - this sparsifies the graph, filtering a dense graph and leaving
      only the most relevant connections
  - from here, the person's isolation can be measured using spectral
    graph theory
    - this independence can be measured in graph theory with
      kelman's transformation
    - see spectral graph theory
      [here](http://www.cs.elte.hu/~csiki/application_Kelmans.pdf),
      [here](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~mtait/k-independent.pdf)
      - and [here](https://www.cs.elte.hu/math/phd_th/csiki.v2.pdf)
      - the details of this math is over my head btw

- this, of course, assumes the person is a "normal" facebook user,
  where the relevant 1-degree and 2-degree connections in the friend
  graph are all also "normal" users
  - this high-level algorithm could also work with clustered types of
    facebook users
    - yet, the degree in variation in how people use applications to
      communicate and their distribution of time/usage across multiple
      applications makes clustering extremely difficult.
    - at least, if a clustering algorithm is to enable the selection
      of users which fit some basis with quantifyable variation and
      some metric of confidence

- during and after segregation, social isolation created massive, but
  hard-to-see setbacks for the african american community. this
  strongly limited social mobility because african americans forged a
  disproportionately small amount of strong connections with
  influential people with social/financial capital.
  - this is especially hard to see if you don't experience it.
  - the exact consequences of this are difficult to see or prove, but
    it means opportunities for advancement and economic well being
    were consistently out of reach, even after segregation officially
    ended.
  - even though the law was fixed, minority communities had a greater
    average networking distance to the gatekeepers of economic
    opportunities (not all white people, but rich white people),
    though it's difficult to measure
  - this takes time to heal, though there is plenty of room for
    improvement, i think it has significantly improved over the
    previous three generations.

- in a purely digital world, manipulation of social media algorithms
  to exclude "undesirable" individuals could create disconnection
  among groups of people, defined logically instead of by ethnicity.
  - i don't mean this to be compared to segregation
  - in a convergent social network that is increasingly less engaged
    in "real" interactions and more engaged in "virtual" interactions,
    where some interactions can be voluntarily or involuntarily
    censored via SEO/Social Media manipulation, this means that entire
    groups of people can become silenced or disenfranchised without
    even knowing it.

### (16?) information in particle form complicated versions of entanglement

- if information can be conceived as packets or particles, then when
  does the information take on particular forms
  - combining datums modeled by holons with lambda calculus
  - the physical manisfestation of the information is not meaningful
    until it develops a corresponding physical manisfestation in an
    information-processing agent.
    - therefore: metaphysical entanglement
    - this kind of entanglement can "reach back through time" in a
      way. information representations can effect each other through
      time and space, without direct physical connections.
      - this is because some information processing entities are
        autonomous.

### (17?) Superposition of social circuitry?

- this concept is really an extension of the idea of superposition of
  particle states to information networks which are composed of
  information represented by particles which behave in ways analogous
  to quantum particles.
- does the idea of superposition of networks warrant its own section?
  - this idea of the superposition of various networks is distinct
    from systems where there is one clear network structure
- this is literally the superposition principle applied to virtual
  network topology (... is it?)
  - the dynamics of superimposed virtual networks are dependent on the
    structure of all the "summed" networks.
    - here the "state" being summed over is all the possibilities of
      network topology...
- these ideas need some work, but what this means is changes to flow
  in one network
  - e.g. you superimpose a million circuit diagrams on top of each
    other. the behavior of the system then emerges not from one
    circuit diagram, but from all of them. therefore, changes to
    individual circuits do not affect the behavior of a superimposed
    system quite as much as they would affect an isolated system.
- this seems very similar to ideas from quantum computing circuit
  diagrams.

# (Physics Analogies for Social Systems)

The speed of information is just one quantifiable social metric whose
momentary (scale) lead profoundly impacts interaction across
society. Just like thermal energy, sociophysical system operate with,
preserve and disperse energy, but this energy can usually be
defined in infinitely many ways.

  - (succinctly describe other metrics at a high level, that were
    easily observable by people throughout history, whose trends could
    be anticipated)
  - distribution of information
  - spectrum of available information
  - spectrum of modes of communication
  - value of information

- people as particles: temperature, density, state, etc.
- speed of sound
- phase changes
- configurational entropy & conformational entropy

### Tempurature

- should this be moved to an article on social physics?
- the ideas of "temperature" and "energy" for the high-dimensional
  systems of social physics
  - spatial or physical temperature/energy/motion
  - the more metaphysical, high-dimensional temperature/energy of
    information

- social physics temperature, induced by sunrise
  - informational movement from east to west
    - increasing "temperature"

### Speed of Information Transfer



### Particles and Molecules

- (note up front that everything in this paragraph is overly
  simplified. rename people as particles and describe it as a
  simulation)
- IRL social interactions are constrained by the spaces they occur in.
  - if viewed top-down in 2D, geometric patterns emerge.
  - this is where the physics interactions get interesting because, if
    you idealize them to a sociophysical model, people interact with
    shared fields, just like particles do.
    - there are fields that attract and repel. there are fields that
      are far more complicated than any in physics, like the shared
      field of attention.
    - when interacting, people try to harmonize the space between each
      other. they like to be close when they are interested in the
      interaction, but not too close.
      - so in an overly simplistic model, they influence a shared
        field that causes them to repel and attract each other.
    - but, people are constantly reading each other and there is this
      shared field of attention that emerges.
      - people have a natural urge to know what other people are
        interested in. so, they subconsciously read signals that
        indicate attention
        - imagine a 2D space with a heat map that shows everyone's
          average object of attention
        - they are naturally pulled towards the areas of the heatmap
          that are strongest.
        - they are pulled towards the gradient of the laplacian of the
          group's influence on the shared field of attention... (reword
          this)
        - IRL, it's not so simple.

- then you can define rules that determine which particles can
  transmit information
  - they have to be within some minimum distince to "connect"
  - once they are connected to a group, the simulation's interactions
    have a set rules
  - but particles should form groups that resemble molecules, but
    because of how the particles simultaneously repel and attract each
    other, they form a fairly limited set of molecule shapes.
    - the shapes are primarily circular (2-6 people can easily circle
      together and talk in a fairly noisy space)
    - but then, depending on how each particle's attention affects
      their behavior and physical orientation, these primary shapes
      can merge to form more complex shapes.
  - these group connections have a logical graph structure that is
    imposed ontop of the physical structure (the shape of the
    "molecule")
    - IRL, people are moreso thinking about the logical structure when
      they interact, but the physical structure also matters.

- the geometry that emerges in IRL social interactions also adheres to the
  spatial constraints.
  - the physical arrangement of objects in the space contributes
    heavily to range of possibilities for interactions that emerge,
    but also strongly shapes the physical and logical geometry of
    group interactions.
    - feng shui helps us think about this aspect of social
      interactions
  - this sounds complicated, but isn't. if there's a restaurant with
    ten tables in one of its rooms, the people who sit down can only
    arrange themselves in specific ways.
    - this is similar to "holes" in N-doped and P-doped silicon
      transisters, if we're overly eager for physics analogies.
  - so, the physical arrangement of the space and functional specifics
    of its objects tends to constrain the configurational and
    conformational entropy of interactions in the space.

### Configurational Entropy in Sociophysical Systems

- in genetic systems, patterns of change and entropy in
  configurational and conformational distributions dilineates genetic
  programs.

- need to review the concepts here:
  - conformation space are the probabilities of seeing particular
    conformations of molecules, which AFAIK is not concerned with the
    orientation of molecules (at least not the probability
    distribution of conformations)
  - configuration space has more to do with valid and realistic
    arrangements of molecule types throughout a system.
    -

prevalence of...?

- as a sociophysical system progresses, you can keep track of the
  amount of time specific "molecular" configurations of participants
  spent connected.
  - this forms a kind of combinatorially-derived entropy, but it's not
    thermodynamic entropy. it's closer to Shannon's informational
    entropy.
  - you can also keep track of the *types* of configurations that
    emerge. this is probably more important, considering there are
    factorially more combinations with more particles.
    - if there are multiple particle types, then each counts as a
      symbol for combination. (i.e. AA/AB/BA/BB for types A & B)
  - this is useful because you get feedback on understanding how the
    rules of your simulation affect the kinds of interactions that
    emerge amoung particles.
    - and it can help you identify when the rules of the system are
      weighted improperly, leading to lower configuration entropy and
      a skewed distribution

- this concept carries over to organic chemistry, where it's called
  configuration entropy. there is also conformational entropy, but
  this is a weaker analogy b/w organic chemistry reactions and social
  physics simulations.
  - you could say that a social physics simulation with arbitrary
    rules yields conformations of nodes, some more or less stable
  - but, the types of conformations for a group of molecules are less
    defined. it's probably not as useful without some means of
    restricting the types of conformations that emerge by placing
    constraints on particle interactions

#### "A Phase Change in the Functional Fabric of Reality"

- nature of duality vs agency, along geographic/philosophic dimensions
- an agent's degree of influence and perceived influence over
  environment, especially as it relates to some permanent state
  changes.
  - in particle systems which are high-dimensional and where the
    particles have agency and intentionality, phase changes among
    particles have a far greater capacity for effecting other
    particles in the system.

- for the common person to understand, they need to understand what a
  phase change in physics actually is and, most importantly, what a
  phase change is defined as outside of physical systems.
  - if you think of solid, liquid, gas, plasma, BEC ... what makes
    each one what it is?
    - they are composed of the same particles, mostly.
    - why is it that they "seem" so different, qualitatively?
    - how do you define what conditions lead some substance to begin
      to transform itself into a different phase?

- how do you model the interactions between a mixture of a single
  substance where different parts of the space you're observing are in
  different phases?
  - this is the most important part of understanding what a phase
    change is and carrying it over to non-physical systems: how does a
    physicist mathematically model different phases of a
    single-substance system and *why*?
  - this is what distinguishes systems with math that can model phases
    and those that can't.
    - phase changes introduce and enable dramatically different modes
      of interaction between the substance and both it's consitutuent
      parts and it's environment.
    - for example, solids propagate energy as more clearly defined
      waves moving across a more limited set of crystal configurations
      - liquids and gases also propagate waves of energy across the
        system, but there are more physical degrees of freedom for how
        a particle can kinetically react.
      - but, this qualitative change in how a particle reacts to its
        envrionment emerges not from signal particle or the state of
        its local environment, but from more macroscopic relationships
        that emerge from a *group* of particles.
        - that is, it's *difficult* to say whether a single atom of
          carbon is a particular phase at any temperature.
          - the carbon atom just acts like a carbon atom and nothing
            else.
        - as a aside: this is also why various configurations of
          matter at the nano scale can have such dramatically varied
          behaviors that do not appear on more macro scales and do not
          appear for singular atoms and molecules
        - some of these properties are chemical and electrical and,
          thus, are not traditionally considered "phases" by chemists
          or physicists.
          - physical phases are defined as being completely separate
            from the chemical properties of the atom or substance.
        - but the "phase" of a region of a substance determines how
          that section of matter interacts with matter of the same
          substance in other adjacent slices of space.
          - that is, even though it's very literally the same
            substance, the "rules" for how it physically interacts
            change.

- and so, there are phase changes in many kinds of systems. they are
  not just confined to physical systems. some chemical properties of
  matter can be dependent on the substance's phase.
  - some chemical properties that only emerge on the nanoscale could
    be modeled as "phases" although they are not related to the
    physical phases of solid, liquid or gas.
    - and so, as you zoom out to larger collections of the same
      substance, it loses those properties from the nanoscale
      configuration of matter, unless that fragile nanostructure is
      held consistent across the entire material.


### Reynold's Number

- (reynold's number)
        - describes the parameters at which turbulent fluid flow
          emerges. (but what is turbulence for high-dimensional
          sociophysical particle systems)


# Critical Metrics for Sociophysical Systems

- connect these to the 7 hermetic principles

### General/Specific Speed of Information Transfer

- the speed at which any piece of information could travel

### Probabilities & Rates of Datum/Meme Expression

### Rates & Status of Convergence

- the definition of information convergence across a network
  - that is, at what percentage of people in a network would you
    consider the piece of information common knowledge?
  - this is an important metric because its definition affects
    "velocity" of convergence or "distance remaining" to convergence
  - what are the specific ideas from math that define this in abstract
    terms?
    - this would concern metrics of convergence for graphs and is
      probably related to entropy

- the length of time it takes for an urgent piece of information to
  converge across a network.

- (better word than convergence?)
  - consensus?

### Information Permanence

- the degree of repition or replication that's required for
  information to achieve permanence, with various levels of technology.
  - before writing, only highly-prioritized information would be
    achieve convergence through replication.
  - after the printing press, ...


### Informational Entropy

- shannon entropy (i.e. informational entropy) related to the
  more abstract structure of information
  - in other words, what kinds of information, messages and ideas are
    most people going to talk about
  - in a language or character set, this is easier to define.
  - in this context, the structures and variations you are measuring
    are infinite
  - this measure of entropy is important for understanding how to
    distract and disguise.

### Sociophysical and Dirichlet Energy

- measures of energy for information transfer/convergence
  - literal physical energy required to transfer information
  - dirichlet energy (?)
    - this is a generic measure of energy. what are some specific
      examples of applying this idea to sociophysical systems?


### Information Network Flux Dynamics

- the quantity, qualities and dynamics of information flux networks.
  - do nodes exchange information at regular times? with what degree
    of certainty?
  - which nodes exchange information? how often? how much?
    - are any of these things predictable?
      - you'll find that, the more physically bound a social system
        is, the more confidant you can be in predicting/anticipating
        these things.

### Information Network Structure & Superimposition

- measuring/analyzing the graphs/networks in sociophysical systems
  - (are there better terms for these ideas? it'd be better to find
    the right terms from math/physics)
  - interpersonal networks viewed as graphs
    - hierarchical structures: identifying subgraphs ... which are
      self-similar
    - identifying boundaries in the graphs
    - identifying geographic boundaries with a higher capacity to be
      "expander graphs" for the global system (reword this?)
      - this describes america/europe and other areas with diverse
        populations. these areas are more tightly connected with the
        rest of the world.
      - this well-connected aspect of america's social network can be
        leveraged as an asset. (soft power, economic development,
        etc.)
        - expander graph may not be the appropriate term, but
          describes a graph that is maximally connected from any node,
          while having a relatively minimal number of connections.
        - so, from any arbitrary node, you can find a minimal path to
          any other node in the graph. (viz. it's an efficiently
          structured graph. the complete graph is not a good expander
          graph because it's not efficiently connected)
        - AFAIK, the human brain functions as an expander graph with
          some other regular structure

### Permeability and Diffusion

  - analyzing the sociophysical dynamics of information diffusion
    - are some areas more porous?
      - more likely to retransmit information?
      - more likely to absorb new information?
    - how do differences in language affect the transmission of
      information?

### Generic Concepts of Regularity in the System

- measuring the regularity of phenomena in the system

- measuring the different kinds of flux in a system

### Agents, Vessels and Vectors for Information Dispersion

- vessels for containing information
  - (these aren't metrics, but there are important metrics related to
    them)
  - vehicles for moving information
    - foot, horse, car, signal fire
    - imagine your a shady villan from a disney movie and you need to
      stop a message from getting to your king.
      - you know it's a letter; you know the messenger left 5 minutes
        ago; there are X roads leading to X towns
      - you can order people to move as fast as they can to stop the
        messenger, but you need to know whether you can stop the
        message, otherwise you have to change your plans.
      - can you be sure the people you order can outrun a messenger,
        if you don't know who they are?
      - (change the specifics in this scenario?)
      - people have a set of options available to them to transfer
        information. the mechanics of each option is crucially
        important when trying to decide if the information can
        physically escape.

# Zero in Social Physics

- what does it mean to have zero for some of these metrics?









- the western conceptualization of the mind is utterly flawed and the
  materialistic understanding is making americans sick on a massive
  scale, where the easy, cheap treatment for insurance to cover is
  medication. (pull this into a separate article?)
  - the problem is, the chemical imbalance theory in somehwere b/w
    20-80% of cases of moderate mental illness causes psychiatrists in
    particular to treat a totally fallacious cause
    - because the actual root cause is not treated (*the information
      attributed to the patient that is distributed among people in
      their social network*), it's like treating cancer with placebo
      sugar. medication in many cases does nothing, if not exacerbates
      mental illness.
      - this statement will be received controversially, but
        information has a life of its own in sociophysical
        networks.
        - it is difficult/impossible to quanity/assess the
          information, but therapy can help encourage dialogue
        - also, it's not healthy for people to assume the problem lies
          elsewhere... individuals have no control over what other
          people are thinking.
        - however, information injected into sociophysical networks
          literally has a life of its own and once its diffused into
          people's minds, it is almost certainly there forever or
          until each social connection decides to overlook it, (which
          often requires communiction and demonstration of changed
          habits, etc => to each individual the information has
          diffused into)
        - by "information has a life of it's own" i mean these are
          !@#$'ing probabilistic programs that self-replicate
          information
          - usually sophys networks/dynamics are intractibly complex
            that information overload causes most of your social
            connections to be so innundated with details relevant to
            their own life, that they don't necessarily frame their
            interactions based on problematic information attributed
            to your identity.
          - the best way to address these situations is through
            communication. however, similar to how tweet storms ravage
            the social media landscape with self-replicating
            information, so do sophys. information programs
          - this goes right back to the article that i wrote about
            chaotic programming, which is a paradigm that describes
            genetics, human cognition and the dynamics of information
            in social networks.
      - if the medical establishment ever gave me the time of day,
        they would ridicule my arguments here. but this conception of
        sociphysical vectors for mental illess is irrefutable
        - *the chemical imbalance theory will be _destroyed_ by
          computational medicene by 2030* and at that time, the tables
          will be turned and the truth will be set free: the chemical
          imbalance theory is only a primary factor in a minority of
          mental illness.
        - once people realize what they've paying out their ass for a
          sham and sedating themselves with (occasionally) useless
          psychatric medication, they will be furious
    - ok, given some assumptions that, by 2030:
      - for approx 20% of patients w/ mild-to-moderate mental illness,
        comp. medicine will *CONCLUSIVELY, IRREFUTABLY* prove that any
        amount of medication was inappropriate for these patients (the
        assumption is that certainly, any meds were wrong, & therefore
        unnecessarily altered epigenetic expression in the brains of
        patients, therefore *giving* them mild chemical imbalances)
      - and assume that, for another 20-60% of other patients w/
        mild-to-moderate mental illness, medicine ....

- propagation of mental illness
  - from parents to child (it's really a situation where there is
    diminished propagation of information to build traits needed for
    early/adolescent developmental ish.)
    - so, not actually propagation of the illness, but if it happens,
      it can result from constrained variety of experience or reduced
      permeability b/w parent/child
      - so, it's transmission of habits, etc.
