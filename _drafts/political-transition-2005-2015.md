## My Political Transition From 2005 to 2015

For me, money is useful as it permits me the influence to address the
problems I was so passionate about.

*That's it!* That is the only reason I've wanted money. That is the
reason I was chasing it all this time! I saw problems with the world.
I wanted to fix them and I felt powerless. I thought about it all the
time. No, I didn't complete my bachelor's at Virginia Tech, but I
thought about world affairs and philosophy constantly. World events in
the late aughties kept me up at night. I was worried. We were losing
our freedoms. The dialogue on foreign and domestic policy was
dominated by national security.

Around 2005, I decided I'd have to get money. That was pretty much
it. I decided I needed a lot of it. Ideally, billions of dollars, like
those guys in Silicon Valley. They could make a difference. This was
little more than a feint thought in the background, but it was
there. I needed money if I wanted to make the kind of difference the
world needed. No idea how I'd get it, but I knew that if there was a
way, I'd find it. I wouldn't give up. I wouldn't give in.

Some of the reforms I supported, like drug policy reform, weren't
popular with my family, my community or many of the adults in the
jamskating world. I expected resistence, but I thought people were
going to be a bit more overt. I had no idea what I was getting myself
into. My arguments were compelling and I would not shut up. I kept
expecting a fight, but it never came. It was only around 2012 that I
realized the "fight" had come and gone. No one had given me the same
opportunities they gave everyone else. It wasn't because they were
drug-free, it was because they were drug-silent. They didn't vocally
challenge the laws. I knew I was attracting attention, but I never saw
it coming. I think about the opportunities I lost constantly.

....

As for funding, around 2007, I discovered apps were a possibility, but
I was distracted with skating and petty drama. But I knew that if I
wanted to change things, I needed money and a lot of it. Around 2011,
I discovered that I didn't want anything else, but the ability to
attain the influence to change things. I became single-minded and
decided nothing else was worth it.

This stubbornness was borne out of passion for particular issues. I
saw that things could be better; they should be better. And I was
infuriated with the lack of progress on particular problems. Around
summer 2007, I discovered Ron Paul and if it weren't for that I might
still be liberal. I voted for Nader in 2004. That's how liberal I was.
I thought Chavez was a great guy. He paid the heating bill for people
in the Bronx! A leader from Venezuela gave to random people in New
York City. Out of the goodness of his heart! That's how liberal I was.

- describe problems i was/am passionate about?
- many of our problems are symptoms of deeper problems
  - many of these are cultural
    - to improve these, we need to focus on education
    - but it's not going to be overnight
- mention that I know what it feels like to struggle

I wisened up after 2007 and became more conservative, but I was still
passionate about many of the same problems as the left. Actually, I
discovered that both the left and the right were concerned about
mostly the same problems, but they had different answers. I refused to
give in on social issues and I'm still socially liberal. IMO, those
are mostly issues to be addressed by the family and by cultural
institutions. Yet, many of those cultural institutions have been
weakened.

I'm pretty steadfast fiscally conservative. I've never received
unemployment or welfare or a check from the government outside of my
income taxes, when I got still got a check. I still owed taxes from
2014, but for some reason, it had been real hard to find a job. So, I
gave up finding a job in 2015 after about May. I'd make as little
money as possible and just let my 2015 tax return cancel out my 2014
taxes. Fuck 'em. If I'd gotten another job, I'd have been harrassed
like I was at almost every real job I've had. Fuck 'em!

#### Can't win? Play another game!

I've been unemployed for a long time, but that doesn't mean I haven't
been working hard. I took advantage of all the resources available
online. Wikipedia, Coursera and all the other brilliant ways to
learn. Yeh, the economy has been tough and the distribution of wealth
has been shifted towards the wealthy. The dissipation of the middle
class is a serious problem. Yet, there has never been another time in
history were the poor have more opportunities. No, this doesn't work
for everyone, but for many people & especially young people, *you have
never been as empowered as you are now! In history!*
