title: "the dark side of NLP"

#### 


- conditioning to design a nice user interface for your target
  - it's all about the buttons. what can you press to get them to set
    the off, provoke a reaction or shift their mind to focusing on
    something else -- like this draft?

- example of neurological hackery
  - stimulation of peripheral vision (which sounds dumb as !@#$)
    - this trick works on some psychological dispositions more than
      others.
      - say a group of people had access to plug someone into an fMRI
        while they were unaware, perhaps dosed with sedative hypnotics
        that leave some brain faculties functional while others become
        impaired or less likely to encode memory, then they could use
        VR simulation and generative AI techniques that can match
        voice/video of celebrities to imprint memories that never
        happened
        - or nvm, that's crazy as fuck. there is a strict maximum of
          0.0% risk of logistical problems for illegal/unexplainable
          medical procedures

### Process Vulnerability Must Be Zero and So Must Legal Liability for Human Rights

- before i get to NLP, i want to talk about some new
  technologies. most of these are in their infancy, but not at DARPA.
  - however, it is incredibly important to clarify that the US
    government wants to avoid any physical contact like the plague
    because if your technique does not require implantation or
    constant checkup or strange UFO abductions... then your technique
    does not confer process vulnerability or much legal risk
  - cases of organizaed psychological harassment are incredibly
    difficult to win or argue as long as the participants do not
    digitize information and always use pattern languages and covers.
    - that's all you need: the same techniques spies have used to
      communicate for centuries, as well as some imagination &
      knowledge of NLP
    - best of all, you get the target comfortable with a new "handler"
      and then encourage the target to change their metaprogramming to
      read way to much into subtle cues and images.
      - and at this point, it develops a life of its own. leave no
        digital trace, *and there is no case*. if you have filtered
        your targets to pick on the vulnerable and the poor and the
        weak and those eager to have someone that might reach out...
        - then that draws the target in

### Covert NLP

- *covert* NLP almost certainly requires the early development of
  compliance.
  - this is critical, but even if the target becomes less eager,
    uncompliant

# New Neurological Methodologies

- TMS and TCCD are fairly new. they open up a ton of roads for
  neurological research.

## TMS - [Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation)

- TMS can be used to target neural circuits to encourage them to fire
  faster. small groups of neurons can have their expression
  upregulated (in the *CHAOS PROGRAM* of *human cognition*)
  - generally, what you need to know is that the neurons that fire
    more:
    1. receive more blood flow
    2. receive more nutrients
    3. transform & alter expression of surrounding networks more

## TCD/TCCD
[Transcranial Doppler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_Doppler)

- i *fear* this second method absolutely is being used, may enable
  remote triggering of ... fuck i have no idea lmao
  - but if you implant several nearly microscopic devices in/around
    the skull, this alone can be used to slowly drive someone crazy.
    - there is no EMF footprint, unlike that of TMS, though some
      theoretically miniscule device implanted in the temple or
      strategically located to reverberate through the brain's
      cardiovascular system...
    - like they just start inexplicably hearing ~4000hz for 15-60
      minutes, but only ever at home and usually when they are going
      to bed.
    - that shit would drive me crazy. not really though. 4000hz is not
      so easy to hear.
- obviously, there has been a bit of digression and now wherefore
  regression into thence passive tense. uh oh. holy shit CRAZY
  TOWN. it's a movie playing in theaters soon, starring you because
  DARPA has been studying TMS/TCCD like crazy.
  - don't believe any of this directed energy shit, by the way, but if
    it is real, the tin foil and the faraday cage won't help you.

- TCCD is more powerful than TMS.

        or other analogous techniques like, especially when in the context
        of ultrasound
