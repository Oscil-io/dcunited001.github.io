#### 


- conditioning to design a nice user interface for your target
  - it's all about the buttons. what can you press to get them to set
    the off, provoke a reaction or shift their mind to focusing on
    something else -- like this draft?

- example of neurological hackery
  - stimulation of peripheral vision (which sounds dumb as !@#$)
    - this trick works on some psychological dispositions more than
      others.
      - say a group of people had access to plug someone into an fMRI
        while they were unaware, perhaps dosed with sedative hypnotics
        that leave some brain faculties functional while others become
        impaired or less likely to encode memory, then they could use
        VR simulation and generative AI techniques that can match
        voice/video of celebrities to imprint memories that never
        happened
        - or nvm, that's crazy as fuck. there is a strict maximum of
          0.0% risk of logistical problems for illegal/unexplainable
          medical procedures

# TMS - [Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation)



# TCD/TCCD [Transcranial Doppler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_Doppler)

- i *fear* this second method absolutely is being used, may enable
  remote triggering of ... fuck i have no idea lmao
  - but if you implant several nearly microscopic devices in/around
    the skull, this alone can be used to slowly drive someone crazy.
    - there is no EMF footprint, unlike that of TMS, though some
      theoretically miniscule device implanted in the temple or
      strategically located to reverberate through the brain's
      cardiovascular system...
    - like they just start inexplicably hearing ~4000hz for 15-60
      minutes, but only ever at home and usually when they are going
      to bed.
    - that shit would drive me crazy. not really though. 4000hz is not
      so easy to hear.
- obviously, there has been a bit of digression and now wherefore
  regression into thence passive tense. uh oh. holy shit CRAZY
  TOWN. it's a movie playing in theaters soon, starring you because
  DARPA has been studying TMS/TCCD like crazy.
  - don't believe any of this directed energy shit, by the way, but if
    it is real, the tin foil and the faraday cage won't help you.

- TCCD is more powerful than TMS.

        or other analogous techniques like, especially when in the context
        of ultrasound
