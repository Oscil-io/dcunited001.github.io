title: "The Monadic Model of Metaphysics & Meditative States of Mind"
---

### Pythagoras' and Leibnitz's Concept of the Monad

- greek system of metaphysics (monad, dyad, triad, etc. ) where the
  monad infinitely recurses outward
  - this means that everything can be modeled in metaphysics, but
    utilizing "the monad" in a way similar to that of monads and
    monoids from category theory
  - leibnitz developed his own similar understanding of the monad

### Meditative states of mind encourage experience of consciousness with diminished conceptual designation

- some meditative practices encourage the development and experience
  of states of mind where conceptual designation is recessed
  - ([a better explanation](http://seanrobsville.blogspot.com/2011/06/glimpse-of-non-conceptual-awareness.html)
    of conceptual designation)
  - your mind is calm and relaxed and encouraged to drift
  - conceptual designation means you map structured meaning onto
    qualia. this mostly happens at higher levels of the mind.
  - in modern life, we simply do not experience life without a strong
    reliance on cognitive patterns heavily dependent on conceptual
    designation
    - this phenomena of modern life presents itself in the
      extreme. many of us, perhaps most, may not experience states of
      mind with conceptual designation diminished beyond the threshold
      that makes that state of consciousness appreciably distinct.
    - but meditative practices encourage the development of this mode
      of consciousness. it's relaxed. it feels good.
      - IMO, it may provide an experiential basis for metaphysical
        understanding
      - IMO, it also causes our brain to function in neurologically
        distinct patterns
        - e.g. the neural activity in the default mode network
          may become recessed
        - if this is true, then it may encourage neurons to fire and
          connect in more decentralized ways, similar to how
          psychedelics encourage networks of the brain that are
          usually unconnected to become connected.
          - psychedelics would induce this in a harsh, artifical way
            with chemicals that affect all regions of the brain, where
            spiritual practice would cause this in a natural way.
        - meditative states of mind that suppress commonly active and
          nutrient/energy intensive processes may cause other neural
          networks to fill in the gap, functioning more, but in a way
          that isn't apparent to a relaxed mind

### With more skill, can one maintain meditative states of mind with more sensory input?

- non-conceptual awareness or diminished conceptual designation means
  that you might hear a sound, but you focus does not drift towards
  attending to it. your mind does not try to label things in any way,
  even though you may experience distracting sensory stimuli.
      - this is at least partly why you learn to meditate with your
        eyes closed and in a relaxed state.
        - your mind is less likely to become attached to sensory
          experience
      - i have wondered if it is possible to develop meditative skills
        to maintain a state of mind like this while 'lucid' or at
        least with the eyes open
        - what would my experience be like? language must require
          conceptual designation. i assume that almost all structured
          thought would as well.
        - it is very interesting to observe how visual stimuli provoke
          conceptual designation. i.e. triggering this state of mind
          while you are visually stimulated by a beach and waves in
          the ocean would be easier than while staring at posters with
          lots of text or recognizable imagery
          - this is because your cognitive and subconscious processes
            are reading in and processing these stimuli. even if you
            aren't trying to think about what you are seeing, your
            mind is preprocessing and caching data, layering in
            conceptually designated information
        - so, what would it mean to operate in a quasi-lucid state of
          consciousness where most of these processes are diminished?
          - is this similar to the state of mind i feel when i play
            piano, either memorized or improvised? is it similar to
            what i feel when i'm dancing and i'm hyperfocused, yet not
            focused at all?
            - when i'm engaging in these activities, i feel varying
              degrees of constraint/structure on my cognitive
              processes. when i'm not trying to structure what i'm
              doing and i don't need to think about it, that's when i
              perform the best. but my mind begins to wander or will
              simply fade into the background.

### How does this correlate to monadic metaphysics?

  - so, if meditative states of mind intended to reduce conceptual
    designation to induce an experience of "non-conceptual awareness"
    (as referred to by author of the above article) is this
    functionally linked to a monadic model of metaphysics?
    - does this gradually lead to an a posteriori understanding of
      monadic metaphysics?

### Conditioning of Conceptual Designation Leads to a Distracted Mind

  - also, people who i feel like used hypnotis or NLP techniques,
    would condition me with stimuli that distracted my focus and
    layered meaning onto stimuli.
    - if they actually were doing this, they could then trigger my
      cognitive processes to react to specific imagery and types of
      sensory experience.
    - they could cause my mind to change the quality of cognitive
      activities. it causes your mind to be triggered into utilizing
      different neurological modalities (a term which NLP references
      heavily)
    - it can be incredibly distracting, especially if you have ADD or
      aspergers
    - for example, in context of the expression "he pushed my
      buttons", NLP is like how you create those buttons.
      - you can then subtly trigger someone to begin thinking about
        specific imagery or trigger brief emotional states that the
        person becomes more likely to re-express in the short-term
    - if so, it's interesting how these techniques are kind of like
      *the opposite* of gradually shedding conceptual designation in
      that they condition you to create artificial constructs
    - and if someone did this intentionlly and surreptitiously, this
      seems a bit ... mean. and like not just mean. it seems like
      something you might see in a silence of the lambs movie. like
      something the serial killer character could and would do to
      people.
      - and it requires so much forethought, plenty of regular contact
        with the subject/target, and *constant* focus on the malicious
        intent of bringing harm to that person.
