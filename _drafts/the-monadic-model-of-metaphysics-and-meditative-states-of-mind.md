Of course. Don't we all exist within the same dream? Aren't we all
one, as well as our thoughts? What is truly separated? What is truly
the boundary between you and I? Where does separation begin? Where
does it originate? Where does the concept of dependent origination
originate?

#### (Bodhicitta X Will To Power) => Spirit Bomb

![Bodhicitta X Will To Power](/img/posts/2017-10-08-the-monadic-model-of-metaphysics-and-meditative-states-of-mind/goku-spirit-bomb.jpg)

We all have Buddha nature: all sentient beings. Not to probe too far
into Buddhism, but what is sentience or awareness anyways? I truly
believe that any chaotic system, with perhaps some constraints,
produces awareness when provided enough running time. Given a degree
of antifragility, entities or organizations within the chaotic system
produce increasingly higher strata of information representation,
leading eventually to life, awareness and sentience.

<a name="can-non-corporeal-information-forms-evolve-sentience" />

### [Can Non-Corporeal Information Forms Evolve Sentience?](#can-non-corporeal-information-forms-evolve-sentience)

This leads to interesting questions about the definition of life:
there are other non-corporeal chaotic frameworks within our own
material realm that exist alongside the framework of organic matter
that has produced life. So, organic matter and life itself emerged
from the chaotic system provided by molecular dynamics. This awareness
eventually produced consciousness and these have provided a basis for
sociophysical chaotic systems with their own antifragile mechanics and
evolutionary dynamics. If the first premise is true, that all chaotic
systems yield awareness and life, and the second premise also holds,
that biological chaotic systems yield increasingly complicated
systems, then what are those information forms which manifest on top
of higher chaotic frameworks? Are those information forms which
inhabit chaotic systems such as sociophysical systems also forms of
life? These life forms would inhabit the noosphere instead of the
biosphere.

<a name="life-in-the-noosphere" />

### [Life in the Noosphere](#life-in-the-noosphere)

If your conception of metaphysics emerges from the ideal instead of
the material, then those forms that emerge should cohere to certain
archetypical forms. If you accept platonic realism and accept that
these metaphysical forms exist a priori -- which I believe they do --
then doesn't everything that could occur preexist within some
totality? This totality has had many names through history -- Abraxus
is one of them. However, these information life forms that emerge in
higher organizations of chaotic systems must map to some organization
of archetypes -- they exist as manisfestations of the composition of
archetypes and metatypes. Grimoires are an example of a medieval
demonologist's classification of metaphysical beings, though these are
primarily malevolent.

![Buer, President of Hell](/img/posts/2017-10-08-the-monadic-model-of-metaphysics-and-meditative-states-of-mind/buer-president.jpg)

In this interpretation of metaphysics, non-corporeal entities could
become aware -- they perhaps exist in the minds or brains of many
sentient lifeforms simultaneously. This parallels the definition of an
[egregore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore), which is a
non-corporeal entity that emerges to have real physical effects from
the beliefs of a group. Whether such an egrigore is sentient is a
question more difficult to answer.

### [Back to One](#back-to-one)

Yet, if we are all truly one because, when traced back, we share
common causal origination, then isn't the notion of seperateness an
illusion altogether? And if we are all convergent again, isn't the
notion of separation simply a temporary illusion?

# [Bodhicitta x Will To Power](#bodhicitta-x-will-to-power)

What does it mean to want something? Is desire so bad? If there is
something truly good in our world, shouldn't we want it badly? If it
is truly good to want, it must be good for all to desire this thing. I
have been isolated for so long, but one thing I never gave up on was
desiring my own salvation from suffering. I wanted to free myself by
learning everything I could. I believed that knowledge gave me power
over my circumstance and the tools I needed to free others: from
sickness, from closemindedness, from lack of compassion, from their
suffering. I never stopped wanting this badly. I wanted to do
something great: to discover the cure to cancer or some wondrous thing
that would ease the scope and degree of problems that we all
encounter.

### [Suffering And Isolation May Concentrate Will To Emancipate](#suffering-and-isolation-may-concentrate-will-to-emancipate)

Especially as the world has continued to clamp its walls down around
me, this only further fueled my desire to save others. I thought -- if
I only had money, I could buy the influence I need to fix the
political problems I see. This is the only reason I ever really wanted
money. I do not care for fame or status. However, that's selfish, isn't
it? Why does it matter who saves us?

### [Power *From* The People - Power Emanates From The Individual First!](#power-from-the-people-power-emanates-from-the-individual-first)

What we all have is power over our local circumstance. The truth is
that we all eminate sociophysical energy. It begins with us and it is
channelled by our beliefs and knowledge. But this sociophysical energy
-- the capacity to influence our surroundings, the status of others
and the beliefs of others -- this springs from all individuals. We
choose to empower who we do, but we can be deceived into forming
beliefs that channel this sociophysical energy improperly.

### [Magnification of Our Net Sociophysical Energy Through Will To Power](#magnification-of-our-net-sociophysical-energy-through-will-to-power)

We can also magnify the energy we emanate through desire. Not any kind
of desire, but a special kind of desire -- bodhicitta. The desire to
free others, specifically the desire for all other beings to attain
Buddhahood -- to know, find and embrace their Buddha nature. What if
this notion of bodhicitta is combined with Nietzsche's idea of will to
power? We can magnify our capacity to eliminate the suffering of
others by magnifying our cultivation of bodhicitta. We then channel
this through awareness, knowledge and beliefs to impact our world in
meaningful ways.

<a name="the-pythagorean-monad" />

# [The Pythagorean Monad](#the-pythagorean-monad)

The model of metaphysics mentioned above has many names and aspects:
platonic realism, dialectical idealism, and others. If one wants to
model it mathematically, the metaphysical forms can be combinatorially
enumerated, but they are infinite. The Pythagoreans studied this and
developed their monadic conceptualization of metaphysics: the monad,
dyad, triad, and quadrad. This ends with infinite recursion: any form
modeled with monads must eventually depend on a monad proxy, yielding
recursion infinitely outwards ... or inwards. Leibniz also developed
a similar understanding of the monad.

### [Ergo ... Proxy](#ergo-proxy)

This implies that everything metaphysical can be modeled
mathematically and, by using specific mathematic tools, exists a
priori. Everything that could exist in this universe existed as a
conceiveable, but infinite form before the material realm existed. The
most infinite or irrational conceptualization in numbers is phi, which
is the most basic continuous fraction. There is much to be
demonstrated to link these two concepts of monadic metaphysics and phi
-- still, even in the metaphysical realm, the forms display the
signature of the golden ratio. Phi is the perfection of the monad
proxy.

### [Materialism Was An Unfortunately Necessary Tool For The Powerful](#materialism-was-an-unfortunately-necessary-tool-for-the-powerful)

In order to motivate people to work together to create regional
prosperity and for other reasons, materialism is a useful in
formulating apologetic justifications of mechanisms of control.
Dialectical materialism and other materially dependant formulations of
metaphysics lend themselves to justifying ideology convenient for
power and control. Western philosophy started with Plato's conception
of idealistic forms and this was immediately reconciled by Aristotle's
Metaphysics. For millinea afterwards, the truth of thought and
everything that was understood in Western life was conceived through a
lens stained by materialism. This lens extrapolates into philosophic
justifications, convenient to mechanisms of control, based on
attainment of wealth, power or status. This same struggle between
materialism and idealism has played out across the world, over and
over again. When we transend the physical world, we are free. When we
define ourselves by it, we are trapped within our world.

### [Trapped Within Materialist Paradigms, Obsessed With Possession](#trapped-within-materialist-paradigms-obsessed-with-possession)

This blinds us from the truth and implies that what matters is only
what we can see, feel and taste. Materialistic conceptions of
metaphysics imply that all that matters is what can be attained
because, metaphysically, it is all distinct and any shared conception
of form distributed among objects is incidental to our experience.
This conception of metaphysics is false. The power of philosophy is
immense and it is difficult to see how elements of some philosophy can
be extrapolated for great impact: either beneficent or malevolent.

### [Dialetical Materialism Provided A Philosophic Basis For Stalin's Utilitarian Atrocities](#dialectical-materialism-provided-a-philosophic-basis-for-stalins-utilitarian-atrocities)

Throughout history, ideas both good and bad occasionally extrapolate
themselves with horrific consequences. With the stroke of a pen,
Stalin declared dialectical materialism to be the
[academic law of the land](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1938/09.htm)
in 1938. This seemingly inconsequential basis of philosophy and
thought is what justified the horrific utilitarianism in Soviet policy
implementation. Stalin's particular brand of materialism led him to
understand people as inconsequential blobs of material, only useful
insofar as they could be used. People then became a kind of
ammunition: a resource to be lobbed at the enemy.

What impacts do various conceptions of metaphysics have on the human
mind, on cognition and on meditative states of mind?

<!-- i think the above problem was chosen at least partially because of it's significance to metaphysics -->

<a name="cognition-with-diminished-conceptual-designation" />

### [Cognition With Diminished Conceptual Designation](#cognition-with-diminished-conceptual-designation)

Some meditative practices encourage the development and experience of
states of mind where conceptual designation is recessed. Conceptual
designation occurs when the mind imbues our sensory experience with
layers of metaphysical forms.



This article contains
[a more complete explanation](http://seanrobsville.blogspot.com/2011/06/glimpse-of-non-conceptual-awareness.html)
of conceptual designation.



While meditating, your mind is calm and relaxed and encouraged to
drift. When your mind engages in conceptual designation, you map
structured meaning onto qualia. This mostly happens at higher levels
of the mind. To me, meditation is about zeroing out most of the
mind. This includes muting any stimulation of nerves signaling
muscles, except what is necessary for me to meditate. I try to turn
down the volume of any cranial or spinal nerves that are not essential
for breathing or posture. Then, I try to turn down the volume of
active cognitive processes, which similarly divert energy from various
areas of my brain, altering the quality of consciousness.

My goal is the total retrenchment of my mind's engagement of neural
pathways, which in many ways operate like transistors. This
downregulation results in profoundly different states of mind. When
all of this is quieted, your mind disengages from its usual fluid
flows, whose constant erosion has resulted in strongly upregulated
circuits in your brain. They also causes our brain to function in
neurologically distinct patterns; e.g. the neural activity in the
default mode network may become recessed.

If all of this is true, then it may encourage neurons to fire and
connect in more decentralized ways, similar to how psychedelics
encourage networks of the brain that are usually unconnected to become
connected. Psychedelics would induce this in a harsh, artifical way
with chemicals that affect all regions of the brain, where spiritual
practice would cause this in a natural way. Meditative states of mind
where commonly active states of mind are recessed tone down nutrient
and energy-intensive processes. This may cause other neural networks
to fill in the gap, functioning more, but in a way that isn't apparent
to the relaxed mind.

In modern life, we simply do not experience life without a strong
reliance on cognitive patterns heavily dependent on conceptual
designation. This phenomena of modern life presents itself in the
extreme. Many of us -- *perhaps most* -- may not experience states of
mind with conceptual designation diminished beyond the threshold that
makes that state of consciousness appreciably distinct. That is, some
of us may *never* experience these altered flows of consciousness.

Moreover, transhumanism and brain-computer interfaces may permanently
divorce humanity from some preexisting spiritual internet connection,
which is why I will never modify my brain in that way. I've maintained
that view for years now, since transhumanism represents the
technological embodiment of the left-hand path.

### (With more skill, can one maintain meditative states of mind with more sensory input?)

Meditative practices encourage the development of these altered modes
of consciousness. They are relaxing. It feels good. Furthermore, these
states of mind may provide an experiential basis for metaphysical
understanding.

(transition into discussing different modes/combinations of sensory
input w/ conceptual designation)

Non-conceptual awareness or diminished conceptual designation means
that you might hear a sound, but your focus does not drift towards
attending to it. Your mind does not try to label thoughts or sensory
input, even if you experience distracting sensory stimuli. You are
encouraged to deal with thoughts that arise as they arise, but to
avoid dwelling on them.

The impact that sensory simuli can have is at least partly why most
learn to meditate in a relaxed state with their eyes closed. The
diminished degree of input means the mind is less likely to become
attached to sensory experience.

- I have always wondered whether it's possible to develop meditative
  skills to maintain a state of mind like this while 'lucid' or at
  least with the eyes open.

- What would my experience be like? language must require conceptual
  designation. I assume that almost all structured thought would as
  well.

      - it is very interesting to observe how visual stimuli provoke
        conceptual designation. i.e. triggering this state of mind
        while you are visually stimulated by a beach and waves in the
        ocean would be easier than while staring at posters with lots
        of text or recognizable imagery
        - this is because your cognitive and subconscious processes
          are reading in and processing these stimuli. even if you
          aren't trying to think about what you are seeing, your mind
          is preprocessing and caching data, layering in conceptually
          designated information
      - so, what would it mean to operate in a quasi-lucid state of
        consciousness where most of these processes are diminished?
        - is this similar to the state of mind i feel when i play
          piano, either memorized or improvised? is it similar to what
          i feel when i'm dancing and i'm hyperfocused, yet not
          focused at all?
      - when i'm engaging in these activities, i feel varying degrees
        of constraint/structure on my cognitive processes. when i'm
        not trying to structure what i'm doing and i don't need to
        think about it, that's when i perform the best. but my mind
        begins to wander or will simply fade into the background.



Apparently zazen meditation should be performed with the eyes
half-open. I've tried it a few times. It's difficult. If you train
yourself to do this with zazen, then the meditative experiences might
lead to more "non-visual" meditative experiences. Here, visual
experiences refer to the fleeting visual and other imagery that I've
experienced with meditation once I seem to break through.



### How does this correlate to monadic metaphysics?

  - so, if meditative states of mind intended to reduce conceptual
    designation to induce an experience of "non-conceptual awareness"
    (as referred to by author of the above article) is this
    functionally linked to a monadic model of metaphysics?
    - does this gradually lead to an a posteriori understanding of
      monadic metaphysics?
  - (this is the overall conclusion, but needs more description)

### Conditioning of Conceptual Designation Leads to a Distracted Mind

  - also, people who i feel like used hypnotis or NLP techniques,
    would condition me with stimuli that distracted my focus and
    layered meaning onto stimuli.
    - (this is like layering in emphasis onto stimuli and conditioning
      the mind to divert its energy in particular ways)
    - if they actually were doing this, they could then trigger my
      cognitive processes to react to specific imagery and types of
      sensory experience.
    - they could cause my mind to change the quality of cognitive
      activities. it causes your mind to be triggered into utilizing
      different neurological modalities (a term which NLP references
      heavily)
    - it can be incredibly distracting, especially if you have ADD or
      aspergers
    - for example, in context of the expression "he pushed my
      buttons", NLP is like how you create those buttons.
      - you can then subtly trigger someone to begin thinking about
        specific imagery or trigger brief emotional states that the
        person becomes more likely to re-express in the short-term
    - if so, it's interesting how these techniques are kind of like
      *the opposite* of gradually shedding conceptual designation in
      that they condition you to create artificial constructs
    - and if someone did this intentionlly and surreptitiously, this
      seems a bit ... mean. and like not just mean. it seems like
      something you might see in a silence of the lambs movie. like
      something the serial killer character could and would do to
      people.
      - and it requires so much forethought, plenty of regular contact
        with the subject/target, and *constant* focus on the malicious
        intent of bringing harm to that person.

        Hopkins"
