### The "objective" when making a social app

a lot of people don't understand what their objective is when they make
an app. especially when they're building a social media app.
- you're not going for ad revenue.
  - you're not even really going for money.
  - or necessarily number of users
    - in fact, early user growth *could* end up being bad later on,
      even if the response seemed overwhelmingly positive
    - high levels of early user growth is usually fantastic obviously
- after all, deriving value in a network requires at least two things
  - (1) users and (2) connections between users
  - that is, even with facebook-level user count, you have nothing if
    the users have no connections to anyone else on the site.
    - though it's great to have such a high number of users that there
      couldn't possibly be users on the site who have no connections
      to anyone else
    - but if those connections are hard to develop, it's pretty
      limiting
  - a third critical factor is activity. both:
    - user activity (preferably weekly or daily)
    - and user interaction activity
      - and hopefully this provides enough value for your users to
        keep coming back
    - this is kinda why early user growth can be a bad thing
      - if you're users come to your platform in droves, but there's
        no one there, you'll send the wrong signals
      - then again, if you drive user growth with hacked fake
        profiles, like with ashley madison, that's not really doing
        your users any service either
  - a fourth critical factor is like engagement and value for interactions
    - apps with users that are consistently posting and interactiong are
      further adding to the application's network value
      - apps are like higher order networks, where it's not just the
      number of users
      - think of a network with a temporal dimension and users are more
        likely to interact with other users who have been online
        recently.
      - if you optimize the number of users online each day and you
        just look at that timeslice as its own network, that's a much
        better estimate for the value of the network
      - furthermore, you can estimate the value of your network by
        comparing how likely users are to interacting on your platform
        versus another.
      - this is gold for venture capitalists, by the way
        - an algorithm that categorizes/clusters users as well as
          their interactions, but across different platforms.
        - when you're checking out companies at various stages of
          development and their team tells you:
          - "yeh our Seed/Series-A shares are fucking gold"
          - well then you can measure the weight of their statement
          - at least you could estimate and have a value of measure
        - however, this would be a bit difficult to do when investing
          in younger companies
          - and with B2B companies because either you can't see the
            data or there's going to be skew that you can't really
            predict.
            - or worse, that skew might mislead you into making the
              wrong decision
        - if the businesses are aware of the decisions you, as a
          VC/Angel are using to add weight to your decisions, then
          they can try to use that against you ...
          - not necessarily in a really bad way, but the company may
            want to see what kind of action you're leaning towards, so
            you can gain the upper hand in negotions and ish
            - these are some of the things "you're just supposed to
              know" as an invester or founder

- the platform, the network, that's what you're trying to build
  - you want to compel your users to come back
  - so you want to develop your network with just the right timing
    - you want to develop your image and your brand in just the right
      time and in such a way that permits flexibility down the road.

- the "currency" for app & social app success is really *time/attention*
  - what you're doing is building a platform with which garners user
    interactions.
- your users attention or their time, that's what your trying to get
  - that is where the value is, especially for social apps. this is
    less true for products marketed to businesses, though.
  - this may change with VR platforms
    - but I keep saying hardware/software/network/platform
      fragmentation is going to lead to a backlash
      - companies that are going straight for total domination of the
        market by trying to create platforms where customers are
        locked in to their software or hardware are doing the
        technology a disservice in the long run

- new social apps based primarily on communication split the value of
  other networks.
  - this is especially true when you look at the network modeled
    temporally, as above
  - yet the value gravitates towards a minimum number of platforms
    with maximum use

- people naturally want to communicate with others
  - so if your app is a great communication platform

- the best product is most effective at garnering and retaining their
  users attention
  - facebook and twitter are particularly good for that
