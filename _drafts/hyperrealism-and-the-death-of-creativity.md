hmmm is dematerialization the right word to use here?
- i wanted to evoke the image that the constraints imposed by hyperrealism
  - cause creativity or the potential for creativity to begin to disappear
- but dematerialization is already defined for conceptual art
  - i think evaporation might be a better word

as science constantly advances, this limits the space of believable stories
- the more we know about the world and how it works on every level
  - from the quantum to the atomic to the microscopic to the macroscopic to the cosmic
  - the more that we know just simply isn't possible
- i refer to this as hyperrealism.  there may be another name for it
  - it is created [from a philosophical phenomenon] -- need to identify where it comes from
    - is it modernism?  the transition from modernism to post modernism?
    - is it structuralism?  how does science relate to these concepts?
- why is this a problem?  after all, the truth is the truth
  - hyperrealism limits our capacity for creative storytelling
    - it prevents some stories from ever becoming real, since "that couldn't ever happen"
  - this usually prevents creative story telling in a fictional, but real-world setting
    - it prevents people from using certain plot devices, etc
  - but this concept of hyperrealism also applies to fantasy world settings
    - where the fantasy world has set up strict rules as to what is and is not possible
    - and fans can be outraged when the system these rules have set up is violated

- this is why i like stories that are told and retold
  - i really like the concept of reboots because it allows us to break free of these constraints
    - it's very similar to how oral traditions evolved over time by being told and retold
    - it allows for flexibility and experimentation.  
    - a multitude of perspectives could be explored
  - however, these constraints -- including those imposed by hyperrealism -- are important
    - myths should be constrained to and extent
    - otherwise the elements that make them up -- characters, settings, worlds, plots, etc
      - these might lose their meaning or that meaning would be diluted
    - yet, overconstraining these elements prevents these elements from creating meaning in the first place

why is realism important?
- it's important that humanity retains a common perception of what is real
  - without a common foundation, we can't build much

but with too many constraints imposed by realism
- this causes the creative potential to evaporate by eliminating available "space"
  - and "petrifying" the materialized.  
  - because the possibilities have become concrete, 
    - then art is not allowed flexibility
  - need to refine these metaphors

- hyperrealism means that stories based on science will be perceived 
  - in a radically different light decades after they are written
  - this is because modern culture relies so heavily on the crutch of science
    - and will reject anything that goes against the grain
    - "that's so cheesy. it's just not possible"
    - "omg i can't beleive they thought that was possible.  that's so stupid"
  - because we instantly reject an aging story bc of it's reliance 
    - on a disprovable or laughable scientific basis
    - we total reject all value that might be derived from the story

talk about special effects and the cost of production
- anime is an example of something that transcends this
  - anime is fairly cheap to make and because it's animated, 
    - we don't really expect it to be real
  - bc the production costs are lower than those employed by projects with massive budgets
    - the process allows for more experimentation

explain mythology as a means to pass down knowledge and inspire future generations
- i believe that ancient people knew there was a lot of embellishment to myths

hmmm how to finish this prewrite?
- need to strategically organize the prewrite
- also need to identify examples of films

.... yep, these ideas need a lot of work, if i'm to capture them
