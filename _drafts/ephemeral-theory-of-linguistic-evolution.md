Basically, there are these transcendant metaphysical constructs that
act as linguistic "leylines", to which such ephemeral pre-linguistic
communication groups would be encouraged to adhere.

These leylines would drive early morpheme selection and their
epimemetic viability. These leylines would dictate the
psycholinguistic attributes of phonemes by altering their situational
& functional relevance to the early human condition.

These metaphysical leylines are basically the mappings b/w a social
groups set of phonemes/morphemes and the collective consciousness and
collective unconsiousness.  That is, there were some types/metatypes
of messages that we were destined to need to be relayed as
communication b/w early humanity.

These types/metatypes as basis for communication include: shelter,
hot, cold, food, hunger(a kind of meta-type: anticipation of food),
water, thirst(again, a kind of metatype), fire, danger, unknown,
novelty, awareness, mate, love, fear, life, death, sickness,
singularity, plurality, unity, togetherness, similarity, fire, injury,
type of injury, need, want, hierarchy, possession of a need/want of
another, generalized acknowledgement. These needs/desires are so
universal, they are shared with many animals to a varying of
overlap. Animals can easily communicate such concepts.

Furthermore, there is no skill which furthers the development of one's
mind as much as the development of vocal expression. So this ephemeral
theory of prehistoric linguistic-evolution isn't just relevant to
explaining the roots/viability/selection of early phonemes/morphemes,
it is also very relevant to the development of consciousness. In this
theory lay the roots of humanity's development of intentional
abstraction via assignment/distribution of signs/signified/signifiers
(a la semiotics). There is no pre-historic *psycho-phenomena* or
*socio-phenomena* that accelerates the speciation of consciousness to
the degree that vocal phoneme delineation and morpheme selection does.

- (reorganize the following argument)
- that is, in and of itself, the biological evolution of the capacity
  for vocal dilineation of phoneme's leads to a revolution in
  consciousness.
  - this is because of how that specific, evolutionary biological
    feature meshes with the nature of neural networks.
  - these neural networks must satisfy a range of functionality
    encompassing proficiency in at 7 or more attributes:
    - interdependency,
    - flexibility,
    - redundancy,
    - specialization,
    - clusterability,
    - categorizability,
    - stability (resillience of input/output behavior)
  - these attributes are provided to varying degree by the
    presence/absence of genetically encoded proteins/behavior and
    epigenetically expressed behavior patterns
- therefore, three(?) factors contribute to this revolution in consciousness:
  - the genetically-encoded capacity and development of a sufficent
    number and quality of synapses.
    - the genetic presence and development of potential for neural
      abstraction
  - the genetically-encoded capacity for vocal dilineation and
    interpretation of phonemes
    - that is, it's physically possible for a species to make a range
      of sounds (or non-acoustic signifiers!
    - and it's physically possible for a species to interpret a range
      of phonemes and the qualities of their expression
    - for each phoneme or sound, those qualities for both
      expression/interpretation include:
      - degree of root pitch vs change in pitch
      - degree of initial FFT spectra of sound vs change in spectra
      - degree of initial volume \
      - degree of rhythm/repetition of pitch, spectra,
      - degree of control over expression of that specific
        sound/phoneme.
  - the genetic and neural capacity to:
    - distinguish self from actors in one's environment
      - this is measured neurally by dissonance in
  - the neural capacity to internalize, cluster/categorize and
    recognize aspects of that species' experiences in its environment
    - which includes the HARDWARE! ability
    - degree of a type of sound's relevance to self for a species
        - this requires some notion of self (at least on a
          subconscious level)
        - this requires that an individual of a species is capable of
          enumerating, recognizing and internalizing knowledge related
          to the kinds of experiences which are common for its species
          - and, to some degree, others in its environemtn
          - THIS DOES NOT IMPLY that the animal cognizes these things,
            just that, on a hardware level, its neural networks
      - the degree of relevance to internal/external context and
        meta-context
        - this is a bit more difficult to explain
  - the consistency by which


varying a phoneme/morpheme's
degree of geographic/social distribution or specific functional
utility in the collective consciousness of early humanity

would
even dictate the functional


### Misc Linguistic Ideas:

- (?) Linguistic properties and characteristics that contribute to
  psychology, qualities of communication, social phenomena and culture

- linguistic analysis of english literature compared w/
  accent. Evolution of lexicon evolution, compared with zipf profiles
