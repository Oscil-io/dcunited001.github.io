Basically, there are these transcendant metaphysical constructs that
act as linguistic "leylines", to which such ephemeral pre-linguistic
communication groups would be encouraged to adhere.

These leylines would drive early morpheme selection and their
epimemetic viability. These leylines would dictate the
psycholinguistic attributes of phonemes by altering their situational
& functional relevance to the early human condition.

These metaphysical leylines are basically the mappings b/w a social
groups set of phonemes/morphemes and the collective consciousness and
collective unconsiousness.  That is, there were some types/metatypes
of messages that we were destined to need to be relayed as
communication b/w early humanity.

These types/metatypes as basis for communication include: shelter,
hot, cold, food, hunger(a kind of meta-type: anticipation of food),
water, thirst(again, a kind of metatype), fire, danger, unknown,
novelty, awareness, mate, love, fear, life, death, sickness,
singularity, plurality, unity, togetherness, similarity, fire, injury,
type of injury, need, want, hierarchy, possession of a need/want of
another, generalized acknowledgement. These needs/desires are so
universal, they are shared with many animals to a varying of
overlap. Animals can easily communicate such concepts.

Furthermore, there is no skill which furthers the development of one's
mind as much as the development of vocal expression. So this ephemeral
theory of prehistoric linguistic-evolution isn't just relevant to
explaining the roots/viability/selection of early phonemes/morphemes,
it is also very relevant to the development of consciousness. In this
theory lay the roots of humanity's development of intentional
abstraction via assignment/distribution of signs/signified/signifiers
(a la semiotics). There is no pre-historic *psycho-phenomena* or
*socio-phenomena* that accelerates the speciation of consciousness to
the degree that vocal phoneme delineation and morpheme selection does.

- (reorganize the following argument)
- that is, in and of itself, the biological evolution of the capacity
  for vocal dilineation of phoneme's leads to a revolution in
  consciousness.
  - this is because of how that specific, evolutionary biological
    feature meshes with the nature of neural networks.
  - these neural networks must satisfy a range of functionality
    encompassing proficiency in at 7 or more attributes:
    - interdependency,
    - flexibility,
    - redundancy,
    - specialization,
    - clusterability,
    - categorizability,
    - stability (resillience of input/output behavior)
  - these attributes are provided to varying degree by the
    presence/absence of genetically encoded proteins/behavior and
    epigenetically expressed behavior patterns
- therefore, three(?) factors contribute to this revolution in consciousness:
  - the genetically-encoded capacity and development of a sufficent
    number and quality of synapses.
    - the genetic presence and development of potential for neural
      abstraction
  - the genetically-encoded capacity for vocal dilineation and
    interpretation of phonemes
    - that is, it's physically possible for a species to make a range
      of sounds (or non-acoustic signifiers!
    - and it's physically possible for a species to interpret a range
      of phonemes and the qualities of their expression
    - for each phoneme or sound, those qualities for both
      expression/interpretation include:
      - degree of root pitch vs change in pitch
      - degree of initial FFT spectra of sound vs change in spectra
      - degree of initial volume \
      - degree of rhythm/repetition of pitch, spectra,
      - degree of control over expression of that specific
        sound/phoneme.
  - the genetic and neural capacity to:
    - distinguish self from actors in one's environment
      - this is measured neurally by dissonance in
  - the neural capacity to internalize, cluster/categorize and
    recognize aspects of that species' experiences in its environment
    - which includes the HARDWARE! ability
    - degree of a type of sound's relevance to self for a species
        - this requires some notion of self (at least on a
          subconscious level)
        - this requires that an individual of a species is capable of
          enumerating, recognizing and internalizing knowledge related
          to the kinds of experiences which are common for its species
          - and, to some degree, others in its environemtn
          - THIS DOES NOT IMPLY that the animal cognizes these things,
            just that, on a hardware level, its neural networks
      - the degree of relevance to internal/external context and
        meta-context
        - this is a bit more difficult to explain
  - the consistency by which


varying a phoneme/morpheme's
degree of geographic/social distribution or specific functional
utility in the collective consciousness of early humanity

would even dictate the functional

### Misc Linguistic Ideas:

- what does the difference b/w zipf's distribution for english words &
  japanese loan words from english tell us?
  - japanese loan words are always written in katakana, so they are
    easily distinguished between loanwords by people inside and
    outside of the culture
    - also, this would tend to lessen external influence to some
      aspects of the japenese language
  - this also works for other languages, but it's harder to delineate
    evolution of internal and external aspects of the language

- (?) Linguistic properties and characteristics that contribute to
  psychology, qualities of communication, social phenomena and culture

- linguistic analysis of english literature compared w/ accent.
  Evolution of lexicon evolution, compared with zipf profiles

- search for coupled evolution of morphemes in languages
  - there's a tree of coupled morphemes (this is how we can recognize
    a possible proto-indo-european language)
  - search for coupled evolution of morphemes and stabalization of
    homonyms and partial/full word phonetic collisions
    - this will "crack the code" .... LMFAO
      - it's inevitable that this code will be discovered and it may
        be known that it is inevitable
    - also search for evidence of an accent's influence on the lexicon
- etymological connections between synonyms and homonyms

- morphomemetic symmetry: correlating morphemes and semantics in
  linguistic evolution discover symmetries
  - that is, for many languages, what are the central, most basic,
    semantic concepts *defined first* and what common
    patterns/symmetries/categories emerge when analyzing language in
    isolation?
    - and what patterns begin to emerge in pairs/groups of languages?

- (hmmm i should have some more ideas for data science on
  language. it's just a damn shame that my life has been ruined (was
  attempted to be ruined?) to make me an example)

- what do unused latin chars do on a JP keyboard?
  - like on the hiragana/katakana keyboard
    - this is pretty easy to answer actually, they mostly do nothing
      - but the purpose of this question is trying to figure out what
        those keys could do
  - what are the alt-gr keys on russian keyboards?

### Chinese/Japanese

- to determine the meanings behind radicals and
  [placements](https://kanjialive.com/214-traditional-kanji-radicals/),
  find common placements b/w kanji (see a & b)
  - that is, try to find common placements (there's a name for kanji
    placements) where the same kanji is modified with:
    - same placement, but using a different radical
      - e.g. 一（ひとつ: one） is modified using placement A with 水
        (みず: water) or 人（ひと: person) but both are modified using
        a single kind of placement (kanmuri, ashi, etc)
    - or different placement, where the same kanji is modified by the
      same radical
  - with this analysis, there should emerge some interesting patterns,
    based purely on the graphical relationships in placement
    - the placement types themselves should "mean" something, of which
      i haven't been able to find much information on the internet

```
A: かんむり (kanmuri)

|=======|
|  top  |
|-------|
|       |
|=======|

B: あし (ashi)

|=======|
|   |   |
| L |   |
|   |   |
|=======|
```

- there should be another interesting layer that shows up in both
  chinese, japanese and korean, where there is a pattern of phonetic
  "collisions" that overlays the writing systems of each spoken
  language
  - however, because these languages share the same writing system,
    the mapping that is overlaid on top of said writing system is
    unique for each language (and time period)
  - most of the information here will be purely incidental, but there
    should be some deeper significance discoverable from the homonyms
    and other "phonetic collisions" in each language
  - for an example, see below:

```
去る ＋ 皿 → 盍
sa(ru) + sara → ??? !@#$ it, i forget
```

- i forget, but at the time i saw this, there seemed to be a deeper
  connection here. it had something to do with "covering" ...
  - but the verb is essentially transformed via radical into a rarely
    used verb meaning the opposite of the original
  - i can't remember how i came across this anyways.
  - but it should be possible to develop an automated means of
    discovering "collisions" like this (most of which are purely
    incidental)

[去: to leave or go away](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8E%BB#Japanese)
[皿: plate/dish](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%9A%BF)
[盍: cover, come together, congregate, meet](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%9B%8D)
[盍(jisho): cover, meet](http://jisho.org/search/%E7%9B%8D%20%23kanji)

- also, there's the graphic equivalent of a synonym that's only really
  found in traditional chinese. there are thousands of rarely used
  characters whose meanings differ only slightly from commonly used
  characters

# Study of Linguistics, Anatomy and Evolution

The ability to use language seems to drive evolution towards
intelligence by contributing towards the runaway development of
certain mental, physical and behavioral changes. The evolutionary
contributions from Voice & Language can be zero'd out by other
factors, like genetic capacity for sufficient neurological
developments or the size/shape of the skull and parts of the brain,

- todo: there's probably a name for this subfield of linguistics
  (anatomy, genetics & linguistics)

### Concept of critical mass, as applied to anatomy/linguistics

there should be some set of features and quantifyable attributes that,
in the presence of sufficient genetic & neurological & social
conditions, should further the development of the mind through
consistent capability for overlapping sounds. These features,
qualities and quantifiable attributes must have some minimum critical
mass of each:

- most importantly: the consistency of conserved phonemes available to
  & stable between generations.
  - phonetic possibilities in the context of anatomy is where the
    concept of critical mass: what are the vowel/consonant phoneme
    combinations available/practical for
  - more important: these anatomic features must have a high degree of
    species penetration and quality consistency and evolutionary
    stability (breeds/etc)
    - these factors, if not consistent to almost all members of a
      species will act as multiplicative factors that can zero out the
      possibility of adoption of language.
- consistency/frequency of vocal usage amoung species members
- social & environmental apsects (see below)

- "speciesation" of the anatomic qualities

# social aspects

these aspects of a species will lead to the optimization of:
- the frequency of verbal communication
- language penetration
- phonetic consistency
- consistence life experience

these specific aspects are desirable:
- consistent stable environment
  - relationships with predator/prey
  - does voice/audio/sound reinforce survival?
- fairly social intra-species usage,
- sufficient population density,
- "desirable" species behaviors
- longer generation cycle and more simultaneous living generations
- lower number of children per family & generation
- longer time spent raising children

### Possible experimentation
