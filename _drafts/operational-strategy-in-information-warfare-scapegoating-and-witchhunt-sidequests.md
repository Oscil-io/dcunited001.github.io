As society gravitates towards virtualized communication tools, we
asymptotically approach 100% of surveillable, indexable conversations.
The difference between a surveillable conversation and an indexable
converstaion is that indexing is cheap and can be automated, whereas
surveilling conversations requires human intelligence."

Today, we are approaching a world with the interesting sociocultural
dynamic the escapes the paradigm of secrecy in every era until
now. Since the epoch before commerce and discovery of metallurgy, the
incentive to keep information secret has pervaded culture, even
resulting in cultural movements such as esotericism. That paradigm in
the background of human culture itself has eluded the need for
(inspection).

Here's my snapshot of my grades on my Coursera profile. I'm a lifelong
learner who has dabbled and/or has a basic working-knowledge of
bioinformatics, epigenetics, chemistry, physics, law, international
law, maritime law, military doctrine, logistics, business, venture
capital, finance, accounting, pure math, programming, pharmacology,
philosophy, linguistics, semiotics and countless other subjects. But
in an economy where a myriad of skills fuel your capacity for
employment, I still can't find a job.

### [Unprecedented Dynamics of Information Flux](#a-new-social-paradigm-powered-by-unprecedented-dynamics-of-information-flux)

In the 21st century, the dynamics of information flux in society are
fundamentally different, as secrecy becomes asymptotically more
difficult to maintain, as does retention of secret information in
confidence of its permanence. This leads to interesting and
occasionally depressing patterns in system dynamics.

In context of modernization, globalization and the internet, (the
spread of "fluxable" "space") over which information can quickly
spread is much larger and nearly complete for the first time in
history. It will remain "complete" with regard to human culture until
we reach space, which may create a new paradigm change in human
culture, depending on the viability and specifics of quantum
networking.

The sectors of society most affected: military, finance, and the
intelligence community. Three phenomena radical alter aspects of
society that depend on secrecy: increased "volume" of nodes in the
social graph for information dispersion, exponentially increased
surface area creating each vulnerabilities and capacity for
information flux, along with (infinitely) more velocity or divergence
of information flux. Because these apsects of society reduce the
confidence with which information can be contained, a new (paradigm)
arises in the tactics of information warfare operations. This
(paradigm) incentivizes scapegoating and witchhunt operations,
wherefore the targets are political dissidents and whisteblowers.

### [It's Tough Being A Snowflake In Hell](#its-tough-being-a-snowflake-in-hell)

This is terrifying, in context of novel neuroscience technologies and
the already blurred notion of identity. Once the domain of science
fiction, you could have memories implanted as a political dissident to
be made an example and unjustly humiliated in front of the entire
nation.

### [Automatic Generation of Disinformation By Algorithmic Extrapolation](#algorithmic-generation-of-disinformation-by-algorithmic-extrapolation)

The tendancy of convergence towards information omnipresence leads to
tactics to handle the second and third order effects. From the lens of
functional analysis and a mathematic approach to information, one
should use a "metric" to quantify a neighborhood of "adjacent"
information, which allows the automated enumeration of misleading
disinformation. This isn't such a bad tactic. There are more second
and third order effects in our shared virtual theatre of information
warfare, which preciptates deceptive tactics to deal with what are
acknowledged by all as inevitable information leaks.

###

From a mindset of rigorous utilitarian efficiency not limited by the
burdens of "human rights" and civilian welfare, one should just
instead adapt their tactics to assuming the inevitable and find an
appropriate scapegoat as an example to others. As we begin to quantify
the movement of information through social networks, some of us may
begin to anticipate information leaks, identifying convenient cover
for discrediting targeted individuals. If this is done under the
auspices of national security, and especially if one utilizes the 1918
Espionage Act and Ex Parte court proceedings, this leads to casting
naive political dissidents as the underdog stars in their own poorly
understood demise.

All one has to do is say the wrong thing to someone from another
country. If you pick a country like Canada, then you can trigger the
Espionage Act and all the legal teeth that come along with it, without
the subject's knowledge, *while minimizing the capacity for leaked
information to cause problems*. Since, the other participant is from
another country, the people involved will never communicate to resolve
disparity in accounts. From a game theory perspective, one can apply
the gradient and laplacian along with statistics to show that this set
of circumstances is just as incredibly convenient as it is
unlikely. How many birds are you gonna nail with that stone?

Injection of false information into these situations leads furthers
the degree to which the fight is not fair because HomeSic operates
under the pretense of national security and utilizes NSL's, whatever
they are. NSL is often a misnomer because these assholes don't operate
on paper and, especially if they did, there's no way people wouldn't
help me if they truly knew what was going on. The lack of records
increases the degree by which their actions can be construed as
indicative of cognizance.

The nature of my own situation remains a mystery to me, which leads me
to persistant inquisition. I guess I could be crazy, but that would
suck if someone's own testimony was disqualified or generally
manipulated against them in their own unknown Ex Parte
proceedings. This can feasibly operated *without their knowledge of
giving testimony.* Because in an Ex Parte hearing, *you usually don't
attend.* Testimony could theoretically proceed via wiretap, with the
cold, efficiency of a heartless psychopath.

### [Group Sociopathy](#the-ways-means-and-tactics-invite-hivemind-sociopath)

Sociopathy is employed in groups: workplace mobbing, campaigns to
discredit carniverous social dynamics and meticulously planned
witchhunt sidequests. In the context of a recession, workplace mobbing
is trivial to evoke against political dissidents, which furthers the
goal of marginalizing them with [occupational injustice](). Mental
Health efforts, rebranded as [Occupational Therapy]() as cover for
negative processing of psychology, seems to be employed. This seems to
be a crossover between medicine, mental health, surveillance and OT. OT
could be masked under the cover of academic studies, crossed with
national security, which increases the rationalization of total
secrecy with retribution.

# [A Cover AND A Growth Hack]()

If your goals include expanding government provided healthcare with
socialism, this helps logistically overcome growing pains for both
types of organizations. So you can force government provided health
care on people *while* lashing out against political dissidents with
coercion and systematic disenfranchisement. Oops.

### [Organized Crime Could Become Comorbid](#organinized-crime-could-become-comorbid)

Meanwhile, organized crime gets in while the getting's good and it's
way better because now they can do what they were going to do anyways,
but it's legal, so they minimize surface area of their operatives'
legal vulnerability. So ... the government *literally* turns into the
Mafia, not just apparently.

For the people at the heart of this, national security is a tempting
explanation for their actions because they need the concept national
security in the calculus of the common person's decision making. So,
they'll do it and they'll publicly use it as rational, unless it's a
specific case, where they'll secretly use it for rationalization while
strong-arming people who can't legally make a sound. If they ever make
a massive mistake, the temptation will be to keep it a secret to
prevent anyone from finding out, while flooding people's minds with
misinformation, without the knowledge of the target.

### [Marginalization By Silo For Protection of "National Security"](#marginalization-by-silo-for-protection-of-national-security)

More to the point, if your strategy includes marginalization, then
you've ensured that the option of striking while no one's connected to
this person optimizes its secrecy, makes its timing more flexible,
increases the range of available options and increases the amount of
time that one has to run operations while no one's looking. To be
straight, these people would gladly intentionally isolate individuals
and employ career assassination for psyshcosocial manipulation.
Participation in such means you are complicit in enabling war crimes,
if these tactics are used against the wrong person.

### [Unchecked Corruption Becomes Metastatic](#unchecked-corruption-becomes-metastatic)

"National Security" is in quotes above because it appears to have been
at least occasionally abused as a convenient cover for systemic
corruption. What people don't understand about corruption is that, to
people caught in it, bribes are just about only comorbidity that has
pleasant qualities. Quite often, especially when systemic, corruption
never really comes to light. When it does, what comes to light is just
a portion of what lurks beneath.

### Self-Incrimination Reinforces Collusive Patterns of Behavior Under Cover](#self-incrimination-reinforces-collusive-patterns-of-behavior-under-cover)

As long as they convince you to get your hands dirty, everyone loses
when HomeSic loses, therefore a sociological group dynamic
evolves. This dynamic counters the instinctive desire to stymie the
toxic miasma generated by rampant Cointelpro disruption tactics,
employed without oversight. Cointelpro-type operations haven't been
employed at such scale since the FBI's actions against civil rights
activists in the 1960's. The FBI famously sent MLK Jr. a letter which
harnessed suggestion in an admitted attempt to push him to suicide.

### [Surveillance-Powered Harassment](#surveillance-powered-harassment)

In the 21st century, Cointelpro disruption is executed with
unparalleled confidency and thus, hairpin efficiency. These operations
affect people on the left and the right. They result from surveillance
powered by social media signals and omnipresent hardwire to the
despair of the captains of 21st century industry.  Their interests
interests align with the people and we all lose when America loses,
which undermines the American economy, the foundation of prosperity
and security in America.

### [Logistics and Anticipated HomeSic Growing Pains](#logistics-and-anticipated-homesic-growing-pains)

Witchhunt sidequests to publicly humiliate scapegoated individuals are
cleverly disguised initiatives for organizational expansion. They
offer the convenient opportunity to tackle the logistic growing pains
of the national security industry. Just make sure you pick someone
vulnerable whom you've ensured is socially isolated through a
decade-long campaign of misinformation. He's vulnerable and
practically a pariah?  *PERFECT!* No one will miss him as the tree who
fell with no one around.

###

Surveillance makes gaslighting operations cheaper and easier than
ever. so, if you have a psychopath in charge of your tactics, they can
operate with renowned, cold efficiency and the smugness of a
narcissist.

Greater appeal of psychological tactics in psychological warfare leads
to higher precedence, which leads to confidence, the sharing of
records and the development training processes/documentation, however
obscured. Further, gaslighting requires information handoff between
tight connections/relationships that are usually hidden from the
target and people around him/her.

Since gaslighting and harassment becomes more effective
and easier to hide, each becomes a more appealing tactics for handling
problems. Just put people behind a brickwall of their own
delusions. There is no door.

###

The nature of record collection as a liability is a weakness and one
well known to the people cooperating. As long as psychological torture
remains off-book, it's incredibly difficult to prove, even though the
government will likely never be forced to hand over records. they
operated in secret without financial oversight or process
accountability or manipulated into doing so. *Therefore*, no one would
be aware of information not reported, not that anyone would ever hold
these organizations publicly accountable any way. Once corruption gets
bad enough it's self-reinforcing because everyone's on the take and,
for an operation, everyone is culpable.

# Ramifications to evolution of international law

The foundations of international law that protect individuals,
unquestionable in the 20th century, find themselves undermined in
secret. A possible explanation for the US Naval War College's paper
searching for loopholes is that they are searching for loopholes for
transnational conflicts elsewhere. This could therefore apply to
psychological torture and surveillance-feuled harassment.  In this
paper, part of the discussion centers on how Transnationalism expands
the frame by which certain international treaty provisions are
examined. Particular types of arguments will render the applicability
of various provisions which protect the sacred nature of human rights.
To a degree, a failure of superpower nations to respond to this is
terrifying.

### [Systematic Harassment Campaigns, Including Psychological Torture, May Be Warcrimes]()

By the way, there is a legal argument that psychological torture
against a former US citizen, one labelled under the NDAA as a
non-enemy combatant and/or targeted individuals, opening up the perps
to legal vulnerability. I might only know enough about international
law to be dangerous, but this argument deserves further
inspection. The same argument is discussed in the international law
article referenced above (oh hey, imagine that!) but it apparently
applies to another situation. This argument is compelling enough to at
least warrant public hearing. This reasoning is that those labelled as
non-enemy combatant targets are no longer US Citizens and these are
thus transnational conflicts.

### An International Quasi-Armed Conflict Fought With Psychological Warfare

In turn, these transnational conflicts should then qualify as
international quasi-armed conflicts fought with psychological warfare,
where psychology and sociology have been weaponized against people. If
this sounds liberally defined, it's not. The effects of this kind of
psychological warfare behind the backs of our citizens have been
disastrous in the scope of costs to society and fiscal costs of mental
heath. If the sections of the Geneva Convention covering psychological
torture actually apply to this kind of situation, that means these are
war crimes. Oops, I guess the architects of this system missed
something.

### [No, "What is Transnationalism?" Is Not Actually a Valid Response to Trebek.](no-what-is-transnationalism-is-not-actually-a-valid-response-to-trebek)

Almost no one can claim to be correct if their explaination references
transnationalism in an unqualified with a proposition. Why? What is
transnationalism? Nobody fucking knows. Since transationalism acquires
various labels and varied handling in different studies of humanities,
it's true nature remains highly elusive to me.

It's utility in profoundly known capacity for smashing the Treaty of
Westphalia is palpable, if rarely examined. The treaty established the
foundation of paradigm of geographically defined nation
states. Transnationalism is like the kryptonite to the permanence of
western institutions that upheld the international framework of global
governance in recent centuries.

### [Transnationalism Is Not Solid Material](#transnationalism-is-not-solid-material)

Transnationalism is a little-known and thus a poorly defined, mutable
concept. For example, the concept of a transnational corporation is
completely different than a transnational conflict. But, a
transnational NIAC is not bound by the provisions of the Geneva
Convention which bar the use of psychological
torture. Transnationalism in its legal sense threatens to undermine
certain long held constants of interational law. The fluid nature of
transnationalism tends torwards flexibility for legal applications,
but also contributes to risk of redefinition and and, thus,
reinspection of decisions where transnationalism was material to an
argument.

What results? The desired endstate of postnationalism which, if
reified, pervades at least until we colonize space.

### [I Might Be An Idiot Savant, But I'd Rather Just Be A Savant]()

These are like the things I talk about where the common person just
tells me I'm crazy. Because I'm on another spectrum: our wavelengths
aren't really comparable means of comparison.  These aren't statements
made as an attempt to sound smart. They come from a desire to find
other people like me, but apparently having unapproved friends is a
national security threat, especially friends who might understand what
i'm talking about or empathize with me.

When more birds are hit with the same stone, the probability of a
coincidence becomes much less likely. No, really, it's statistics:
there's functional coupling between events, so they're not
independent. It ain't easy, but that's how you know. There's a point
beyond which low probability events can be assumed to require more
information to explain: that is, they can't be explained by
coincidence unless they occur in isolation. I was actually under the
assumption that the burden of proof falls on the state. This should be
much easier for me, but is this America? Or do I live in some kind of
arbitary wormhole legal system?

### (spiel on natural justice)

MLK Jr. and Ghandi's movements were fueled by social dynamics created
and are depending on sociocultural response to tragedy and overtly
clear wrong doing. Yearning for natural justice moves poeple to
action.  In my opinion, this concept is similar to God's justice or
the "perfect justice" of which only God is capable of dispensing.  The
search for understanding God as a judge inspired religion to found
institutions in pursuit of the codification of the ideal set of laws,
but IMO people today have no idea what the concept of God actually is.

In "The Emperor Wears No Clothes" a child is moved to action because
the corners we all cut in adult life haven't yet marred the lens that
the naive and innocent use to see life. The human condition pushes us
to want and act for change when we allow ourselves to see what is
intolerable in life. This shared experience that informs us of an
intuitive understanding of right and wrong is what powered civil
disobedience in the movements of MLK Jr. and Ghandi. Civil
disobedience is markedly less effective in a society that censors
information and distracts with meticulously manufactured red herrings.
It doesn't mean these tactics don't work, but we need to understand
which aspects of the system need to be dismantled so that they are
effective.

- but an age of both apathy and virtualized life begins to annul the
  capacity for growing a movement. if someone isn't permitted to have
  a movement or sympathizers who is at the center of a controversy,
  there is zero chance this person would have a fair trial. If the
  details of such a national security case were known to be required
  to remain secret or the outcome of the case was essentially
  implicit, being ex parte, then there would also be near-zero chance
  for actual justice or fair trial.

- notes on how ghandi grew his movement with IRL social networking,

Are we engaged in psychological warfare against our own citizens?  Is
there widespread information warfare? People deserve a right to know
of the negative miasma being injected into their lives. It's cowardly
to shoot someone in the back.

I hate to be a smug, nerdy asshole, but here it comes. Here's what I
love about the combinatorial process by which one enumerates over
sociocultural phenomena like information warfare to discover exigent
finalities: I'm right and you're wrong. There are no circumstances
that would allow this ignorant, corrupt behavior to continue
indefinitely. The phenomena mutate akin to data under genetic
permutation until they reach these settling exigent finalities.  Then,
everyone begins to understand how I was correct all along. I do it all
the time.

So you see, it doesn't actually matter what you *think* because I
*know*.
