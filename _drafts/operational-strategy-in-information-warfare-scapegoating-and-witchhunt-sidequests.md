As society gravitates towards virtualized communication tools, we
asymptotically approach 100% of surveillable, indexable conversations.
The difference between a surveillable conversation and an indexable
converstaion is that indexing is cheap and can be automated, whereas
surveilling conversations requires human intelligence."

Today, we are approaching a world with the interesting sociocultural
dynamic the escapes the paradigm of secrecy in every era until
now. Since the epoch before commerce and discovery of metallurgy, the
incentive to keep information secret has pervaded culture, even
resulting in cultural movements such as esotericism. That paradigm in
the background of human culture itself has eluded the need for
(inspection).

### [A New Social Paradigm Powered By Unprecedented Dynamics of Information Flux](#a-new-social-paradigm-powered-by-unprecedented-dynamics-of-information-flux)

In the 21st century, the dynamics of information in society are
fundamentally different because secrecy is asymptotically more
difficult to maintain and to do so in confidence of its permanence. In
context of modernization, globalization and the internet, (the spread
of "fluxable" "space") over which information can quickly spread is
much larger and nearly complete for the first time in history. It will
remain "complete" with regard to human culture until we reach space,
which may create a new paradigm change in human culture, depending on
the viability and specifics of quantum networking.

> thinkin' frilly philosopher types."

The sectors of society most affected: military, finance, and the
intelligence community. Three phenomena radical alter aspects of
society that depend on secrecy: increased "volume" of nodes in the
social graph for information dispersion, exponentially increased
surface area creating each vulnerabilities and capacity for
information flux, along with (infinitely) more velocity or divergence
of information flux. Because these apsects of society reduce the
confidence with which information can be contained, a new (paradigm)
arises in the tactics of information warfare operations. This
(paradigm) incentivizes scapegoating and witchhunt operations,
wherefore the targets are political dissidents and whisteblowers.

### It's Tough Being A Snowflake In Hell

This is terrifying, in context of novel neuroscience technologies and
the already blurred notion of identity. Once the domain of science
fiction, you could have memories implanted as a political dissident to
be made an example and unjustly humiliated in front of the entire
nation.

The tendancy of convergence towards information omnipresence leads to
tactics to handle the second and third order effects. From the lens of
functional analysis and taking a mathematic approach to information,
one should use a "metric" to quantify a neighborhood of "adjacent"
information, which allows the automated enumeration of misleading
disinformation. This isn't such a bad tactic. There are more second
and third order effects in our shared virtual theatre of information
warfare, which preciptates deceptive tactics to deal with what are
acknowledged by all as inevitable information leaks.

From a mindset of rigorous utilitarian efficiency not limited by the
burdens of "human rights" and civilian welfare, one should just
instead adapt their tactics to assuming the inevitable and find an
appropriate scapegoat as an example to others. As we begin to quantify
the movement of information through social networks, some of us may
begin to anticipate information leaks, identifying convenient cover
for discrediting targeted individuals. If this is done under the
auspices of national security, and especially if one utilizes the 1918
Espionage Act and Ex Parte court proceedings, this leads to casting
naive political dissidents as the underdog stars in their own poorly
understood demise.

All one has to do is say the wrong thing to someone from another
country. If you pick a country like Canada, then you can trigger the
Espionage Act and all the legal teeth that come along with it, without
the subject's knowledge, *while minimizing the capacity for leaked
information to cause problems*. Since, the other participant is from
another country, the people involved will never communicate to resolve
disparity in accounts. From a game theory perspective, one can apply
the gradient and laplacian along with statistics to show that this set
of circumstances is just as incredibly convenient as it is
unlikely. How many birds are you gonna nail with that stone?

Injection of false information into these situations leads furthers
the degree to which the fight is not fair because HomeSic operates
under the pretense of national security and utilizes NSL's, whatever
they are. That's a misnomer because these assholes don't operate on
paper and, especially if they did, there's no way people wouldn't help
me if they truly knew what was going on. The nature of my own
situation remains a mystery to me, which leads me to persistant
inquisition. I guess I could be crazy, but that would suck if my own
testimony was disqualified or generally manipulated against in my own
unknown Ex Parte proceedings, *without my knowledge of testimonies.*
Because in an Ex Parte hearing, *you often don't attend.* Testimony
could theoretically proceed via wiretap, with the cold, efficiency of
a heartless psychopath.

The ways, means and tactics invite group sociopathy, workplace mobbing
(especially in the context of a recession), carniverous social
dynamics and meticulously planned witchhunt sidequests. In the context
of a recession, workplace mobbing is trivial to evoke against
political dissidents, which furthers the goal of marginalizing them
with [occupational injustice](). For the people at the heart of this,
national security is a tempting explanation for their actions because
they need the concept national security in the calculus of the common
person's decision making. So, they'll do it and they'll publicly use
it as rational, unless it's a specific case, where they'll secretly
use it for rationalization while strong-arming people who can't
legally make a sound. If they ever make a massive mistake, the
temptation will be to keep it a secret to prevent anyone from finding
out, while flooding people's minds with misinformation, without the
knowledge of the target.

### (marginalization)

More to the point, if your strategy includes marginalization, then
you've ensured that the option of striking while no one's connected to
this person optimizes its secrecy, makes its timing more flexible,
increases the range of available options and increases the amount of
time that one has to run operations while no one's looking. To be
straight, these people would gladly intentionally isolate individuals
and employ career assassination for psyshcosocial manipulation.
Participation in such means you are complicit in enabling war crimes,
if these tactics are used against the wrong person.

As long as they convince you to get your hands dirty, everyone loses
when HomeSic loses, therefore a sociological group dynamic evolves
that counters the desire to stymie the toxic miasma generated by
rampant Cointelpro disruption tactics employed without oversight,
which hasn't happened to such scale since the FBI's actions against
civil rights activists in the 1960's. The FBI famously sent MLK Jr. a
letter which harnessed suggestion in an admitted attempt to push him
to suicide.

In the 21st century, Cointelpro disruption is executed with
unparalleled confidency and thus, hairpin efficiency. This results
from surveillance powered by social media signals and omnipresent
hardwire to the despair of the captains of 21st century industry.
Their interests interests align with the people and we all lose when
America loses, which undermines the American economy, the foundation
of prosperity and security in America.

### (Logistics & Growing Pains)

Witchhunt sidequests to publicly humiliate scapegoated individuals are
cleverly disguised initiatives for organizational expansion. They
offer the convenient opportunity to tackle the logistic growing pains
of the national security industry. Just make sure you pick someone
vulnerable whom you've ensured is socially isolated through a
decade-long campaign of misinformation. He's vulnerable and
practically a pariah?  *PERFECT!* No one will miss him as the tree who
fell with no one around.

Surveillance makes gaslighting operations cheaper and easier than
ever. so, if you have a psychopath in charge of your tactics, they can
operate with renowned, cold efficiency and the smugness of a
narcissist.

Greater appeal of psychological tactics in psychological warfare leads
to higher precedence, which leads to confidence, the sharing of
records and the development training processes/documentation, however
obscured. Further, gaslighting requires information handoff between
tight connections/relationships that are usually hidden from the
target and people around him/her.

Since gaslighting and harassment becomes more effective
and easier to hide, each becomes a more appealing tactics for handling
problems. Just put people behind a brickwall of their own
delusions. There is no door.

The nature of record collection as a liability is a weakness and one
well known to the people cooperating. As long as psychological torture
remains off-book, it's incredibly difficult to prove, even though the
government will likely never be forced to hand over records. they
operated in secret without financial oversight or process
accountability or manipulated into doing so. *Therefore*, no one would
be aware of information not reported, not that anyone would ever hold
these organizations publicly accountable any way. Once corruption gets
bad enough it's self-reinforcing because everyone's on the take and,
for an operation, everyone is culpable.

- ramifications to evolution of international law in the context of
  systematic harassment campaigns that include psychological torture?
  - the foundations of international law that protect individuals
    which were unquestionable in the 20th century find themselves
    undermined in secret.
    - I could be wrong about this, but is the US Naval War College
      paper searching for loopholes and especially for psychological
      torture and surveillance feuled harassment? transnationalism
      expands the frame by which certain international treaty
      provisions are examined, rendering them useless in an attempt to
      protect the sacred nature of human rights. What is
      transnationalism? Nobody fucking knows. Since transationalism
      acquires various labels and varied handling in different studies
      of humanities, it's true nature remains highly elusive to me.
      - but it's utility in smashing the Treaty of Westphalia and its
        international legal paradigm of geographically bound nations
        is palpable, if rarely examined.
      - transnationalism is like the kryptonite to the permanence of
        western institutions that upheld the international framework
        of global governance in recent centuries.
      - for example, the concept of a transnational corporation is
        completely different than a transnational conflict. But, a
        transnational NIAC is not bound by the provisions of the
        Geneva Convention which bar the use of psychological
        torture. Transnationalism in its legal sense threatens to
        undermine certain long held constants of interational law.
      - What results? The desired endstate of postnationalism which,
        if reified, pervades at least until we colonize space.
  - These are like the things I talk about where the common person
    just tells me I'm crazy. Because I'm on another spectrum: our
    wavelengths aren't really comparable means of comparison.

- Here's what i love about the combinatorial process by which one
  enumerates over sociocultural phenomena like information warfare to
  discover (exigent) finalities: I'm right and you're wrong. There are
  no circumstances that would allow this ignorant, corrupt behavior to
  continue indefinitely. The phenomena mutate until they reach those
  (exigent) finalities and then everyone begins to understand how I
  was correct all along. I do it all the time.

- Are we engaged in psychological warfare against our own citizens?
  Is there widespread information warfare? People deserve a right to
  know of the negative miasma being injected into their lives. It's
  cowardly to shoot someone in the back.
