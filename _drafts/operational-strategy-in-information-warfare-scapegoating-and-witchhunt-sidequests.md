excerpt: "
As society gravitates towards virtualized communication tools, we
asymptotically approach 100% of surveillable, indexable conversations.
The difference between a surveillable conversation and an indexable
converstaion is that indexing is cheap and can be automated, whereas
surveilling conversations requires human intelligence."

Today, we are approaching a world with the interesting sociocultural
dynamic the escapes the paradigm of secrecy in every era until
now. Since the epoch before commerce and discovery of metallurgy, the
incentive to keep information secret has pervaded culture, even
resulting in cultural movements such as esotericism. That paradigm in
the background of human culture itself has eluded the need for
(inspection).

In the 21st century, the dynamics of information in society are
fundamentally different because secrecy is asymptotically more
difficult to maintain and to do so in confidence of its permanence. In
context of modernization, globalization and the internet, (the spread
of "fluxable" "space") over which information can quickly spread is
much larger and nearly complete for the first time in history. It will
remain "complete" with regard to human culture until we reach space,
which may create a new paradigm change in human culture, depending on
the viability and specifics of quantum networking.

The sectors of society most affected: military, finance, and the
intelligence community. Three phenomena radical alter aspects of
society that depend on secrecy: increased "volume" of nodes in the
social graph for information dispersion, exponentially increased
surface area creating each vulnerabilities and capacity for
information flux, along with (infinitely) more velocity or divergence
of information flux. Because these apsects of society reduce the
confidence with which information can be contained, a new (paradigm)
arises in the tactics of information warfare operations. This
(paradigm) incentivizes scapegoating and witchhunt operations,
wherefore the targets are political dissidents and whisteblowers.

### It's Tough Being A Snowflake In Hell

This is terrifying, in context of novel neuroscience technologies and
the already blurred notion of identity. Once the domain of science
fiction, you could have memories implanted as a political dissident to
be made an example and unjustly humiliated in front of the entire
nation.

The tendancy of convergence towards information omnipresence leads to
tactics to handle the second and third order effects. From the lens of
functional analysis and taking a mathematic approach to information,
one should use a "metric" to quantify a neighborhood of "adjacent"
information, which allows the automated enumeration of misleading
disinformation. This isn't such a bad tactic. There are more second
and third order effects in our shared virtual theatre of information
warfare, which preciptates deceptive tactics to deal with what are
acknowledged by all as inevitable information leaks.

From a mindset of rigorous utilitarian efficiency not limited by the
burdens of "human rights" and civilian welfare, one should just
instead adapt their tactics to assuming the inevitable and find an
appropriate scapegoat as an example to others. As we begin to quantify
the movement of information through social networks, some of us may
begin to anticipate information leaks, identifying convenient cover
for discrediting targeted individuals. If this is done under the
auspices of national security, and especially if one utilizes the 1918
Espionage Act and Ex Parte court proceedings, this leads to casting
naive political dissidents as the underdog stars in their own poorly
understood demise.

Injection of false information into these situations leads furthers
the degree to which the fight is not fair because HomeSic operates
under the pretense of national security and utilizes NSL's, whatever
they are. That's a misnomer because these assholes don't operate on
paper.


to witchhunt sidequests to publicly humiliate scapegoated individuals,
which offers the convenient opportunity to tackle the logistic growing
pains of the national security industry. Just make sure you pick
someone vulnerable whom you've ensured is socially isolated through a
decade-long campaign of misinformation. He's vulnerable and
practically a pariah?  *PERFECT!* No one will miss him as the tree who
fell with no one around.

- Are we engaged in psychological warfare against our own citizens?
  Is there widespread information warfare? People deserve a right to
  know of the negative miasma being injected into their lives. It's
  cowardly to shoot someone in the back.
