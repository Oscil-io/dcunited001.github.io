excerpt: "
As society gravitates towards virtualized communication tools, we
asymptotically approach 100% of surveillable, indexable conversations.
The difference between a surveillable conversation and an indexable
converstaion is that indexing is cheap and can be automated, whereas
surveilling conversations requires human intelligence."

Today, we are approaching a world with the interesting sociocultural
dynamic the escapes the paradigm of secrecy in every era until
now. Since the epoch before commerce and discovery of metallurgy, the
incentive to keep information secret has pervaded culture, even
resulting in cultural movements such as esotericism. That paradigm in
the background of human culture itself has eluded the need for
(inspection).

In the 21st century, the dynamics of information in society are
fundamentally different because secrecy is asymptotically more
difficult to maintain and to do so in confidence of its permanence. In
context of modernization, globalization and the internet, (the spread
of "fluxable" "space") over which information can quickly spread is
much larger and nearly complete for the first time in history. It will
remain "complete" with regard to human culture until we reach space,
which may create a new paradigm change in human culture, depending on
the viability and specifics of quantum networking.

The sectors of society most affected: military, finance, and the
intelligence community. Three phenomena radical alter aspects of
society that depend on secrecy: increased "volume" of nodes in the
social graph for information dispersion, exponentially increased
surface area creating each vulnerabilities and capacity for
information flux, along with (infinitely) more velocity or divergence
of information flux. Because these apsects of society reduce the
confidence with which information can be contained, a new (paradigm)
arises in the tactics of information warfare operations. This
(paradigm) incentivizes scapegoating and witchhunt operations,
wherefore the targets are political dissidents and whisteblowers.

This is terrifying, in context of novel neuroscience technologies and
the already blurred notion of identity. Once the domain of science
fiction, you could have memories implanted as a political dissident to
be made an example and unjustly humiliated in front of the entire
nation.
