brief essay on why it's foolish to entrust so much control to the
younger generation
- cite plato
- cite examples of regime change and examples where societies
  collapsed because of this
- arguements about life experiences common to people of ages 20-30 and
  how these experiences fundamentally change your viewpoints on issues
  in life
  - these experiences completely change the policies you would be
    for/against

## liberty of the individual vs the liberty of the community

america prides itself on individuality. and individuality over the
past 5 decades is what has fueled america as a cultural nexus over the
past five decades

what won the cold war? freedom!

- the cold war was basically an extended stalemate born out of
  stalin's betrayal of allied powers at the end of WW2
  - and it was settled by espionage -- and what fuels espionage?
    - sources
  - what happened was people in soviet russia weren't free and they
    knew it
    - therefore we got more people to defect over several decades
    - while maintaining our own economic stability, fueled by
      ingenuity, individuality, art/culture, and military strength

- the cold war was a confrontation of utilitarian-inspired policy
  justified by lofty idealism (of communism)


wealth as "moral liquidity"
- ... not actually sure how deep the "liquidity" analogy runs
- wealth should aggregate in a society along lines that reflect the
  values of that society
- the people who possess should be the people:
  - (1) who are best equipped to utilize that wealth
    - and the liquidity of the cash
  - (2) and who utilize the wealth to build their community or nation
- the truth is, some wealth disparity is good
  - because with moderate wealth disparity comes economic resilience
    - bc if there are local economic problems, those with more wealth
      can stimulate the local economy to some degree
  - and if these people are smart with their money, then
    - it can be reinvested to provide economic opportunity, ec
- and if wealth is instantaneously redistributed, then
  - things will return to the norm pretty quickly
  - and people are compelled to misallocate capital and squander their
    local resources

### homogeny is the mother of weakness

- too much shared, centralized culture leads to problems
