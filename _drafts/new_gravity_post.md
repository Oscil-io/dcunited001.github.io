### Directional Antenna

- i was trying to think of what math would allow me to predict how an
  energy distribution would change for idealized omnidirectional
  antennae and directional antennae.
  - from intuition, the answer would be found in looking at the
    surface integrals for timeslices of energy emission
- is the energy emitted by a directional antenna propertional to or
  dependent on the volume/energy distribution normally emitted by that
  energy input?
  - obviously, the mechanics of an antenna's shape and it's components
    orientation in space affect how it disperses energy

    - it is impossible for the energy emitted from an antenna to be
      emitted from a single origin, even if the antenna were composed
      of one particle

- and because many magnetic and EMR interactions emerge from
      micro and macro structures in crystal lattice or crystal
      formations, then this principle that the energy is not emitted
      from one place should carry over
      - and therefore emitted from a region of space enveloping the
        antenna

  - but the fact that there is true origin for the formula means that
    the math here is very much more complicated.
    - you can't just look at a surface integral for a single shape
      (the timeslices of the ellipsoid-like object that propagates
      outward)

    - it likely requires summing over something similar to surface
      integrals for individual contributions to energy emissions for
      subdivided slices of the antenna.
      - each of these components has it's own function that determines
        how much EMR it contributes to the space surrounding it for
        time t
      - however, the phase (& specific frequency) of EMR signal
        emitted from each antenna section would further complicate the
        math.
        - further still, electrical signal is not immediately
          dispersed through an antenna and the timing here is relevant
    - but basically, take the antenna and subdivide it into ever decreasing
      segments, each mappable back to a 3D space, so their EMR
      contributions effects from phase, etc can be dealt with
      - at some level, there will be quantum effects that emerge from
        the interactions b/w particles of these individual wave
        contributions
  - but what this means (i think) is that for the differential of
    surface integral for some specific timeslice t is actually
    composed of small regions of surface area.
    - the energy for each region can be summed to reach the total
      energy produced for each timeslice of ∂t length, which is
      distributed over some volume V
      - this energy varies because of reverberations in the antenna as
        electrical current traveles back and forth
      - and because the antenna can transition between a set of states
        and as it does, the specific 3D chunks of it vary in the
        current absorbed and/or translated into EMR.
        - this results in higher-level behavior that is difficult to
          predict
    - to calculate the energy contribution for these regions of
      surface area, thus forming a number that can be summed, i
      believe some kind of advanced tensor structure is needed.
      - the tensor structure basically maps the 3D location in space
        for that region of the surface area to the 3D-mappable
        EMR-producing regions of the antenna.
        - the distance to each of those antenna regions is needed
        - as well as the speed of light (isn't it always in there
          somewhere)
        - because you want to be able to say: for timeslice ∂t at
          timepoint t, sum all of the EMR contributions from each
          region of the antennae at timepoint t - distance-a-to-s/c
          - where distance-a-to-s/c is the amount of time it's taken
            for the EMR to reach that point in space
          - and the timepoint t - distance-a-to-s/c is used as input
            to calculate state of the region in the antenna
            contributing to the signal.  it's necessary to know the
            exact time relative to the entire system, since different
            parts of the system could shift between states and
            behaviors
      - and so, you should be able to calculate the amount of energy
        in each region of space in the surface integral, summing them
        to get the sum of energy for that shell (or timeslice)
        - each timeslice would radiate outwards as a shell that grows
          larger and larger
        - but at this point, you need to remap the shell's surface
          space (with something like a manifold ... i think?)
          - there's definitely some way to map the surface of this
            (usually!) ellipsoid-like shape (that changes shape!) to a
            coordinate system
      - and after you do so, you can then use gradient and divergence
        to get a bit more information on how the energy dissapates
        - and especially the laplacian (the divergence of the gradient)
