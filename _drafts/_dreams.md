- dream from my childhood about cooking show

- nuclear holocaust dream
  - there is war with russia due to both Russian and US aggression in eastern Europe
    - ultimately, russia provokes a US response to war, but unintentionally so
      - that is Russia did not intent to provoke a US response to war,
      - but that's what it escalated to
    - i justified the circumstances i found myself in early on in the dream with this explanation
  - in the beginning of the dream, i find myself in the battlefield as a politician with no war experience
    - i wasn't really supposed to be over there when it all started going down
    - i was at odds with the people around me, who weren't really expecting to find themselves fighting either
    - at this point in the dream, there was a lot of imagery of like supermarket parking lots
      - esp. one that looked a lot like target (the color red) though this was in eastern europe
  - somehow i get captured (or rather, my team does) and i'm being held hostage
    - this is all like secret intelligence agency warfare at this point, nothing official from either Russia/US
    - these people holding me and my time hostage are trying to say the situation can be dispersed
      - if i just betray my country and switch sides
      - basically, they're offering me a chance to switch sides for my own skin
      - for whatever reason, it's tempting to comply (if in name only), but i don't, basically for semantics
        - that is, even if i don't think i'd confer advantage 2 my country's enemies via a betrayal, in name only
          - i still would prefer to resist in the face of death to prove a point
    - i'm holding out hope that i'll be rescued
      - they enemies holding me hostage don't think this will happen, since it'd risk the death of me & my team
      - but i'm ready to fight and so is my team, if we get an opportunity
  - the US team comes to rescue us. suddenly things escalate into official state action from both sides
    - not yet a war though.  but there is an official battle and putin is there.
    - we get an opportunity and somehow i make it out though just barely.  there are lots of casualties
  - there is a huge battle in the supermarket area.
    - i escape, even though the space we're fighting in is less than preferable (no cover in a parking lot)
    - at this point, someone kills putin.  like shoots him in front of me.
      - obviously, i'd prefer not to talk about this, but it happened in my dream.
      - honestly, i think putin's a good leader for russia.
      - and the rest of my dream explains why chaotic conditions for russia and eastern europe
        - would spell absolute disaster for the modern world
  - there are lots of battles in ravines, lightly to heavily forested.  lots of browns and greens in imagery.
    - the long ravines remind me of star war's trench runs, but with lots of infantry battles instead of air
  - the tides turn and the numbers play out in our favor.  the US and allies think we've won.
    - however, this crazy bitch gets in charge while the nations are negotiating peace & surrender conditions
    - this girl (she's young) is vindictively butthurt.  she's got a thick russian accent.
      - i don't know if she was an official leader of russia at that point
      - but she manages to command popular support -- or at least military support
  - somehow this lady is remotely broadcasting her face and voice everywhere (VR/AR perhaps)
    - but pretty much everyone can see her image threatening the world with nuclear weapons
      - and because of her timeline for threat of action, no one takes her seriously.
      - she's basically threatening to nuke in less than a few hours if the world doesn't comply with whatever
    - she's threatening the world and especially europe with nukes.
      - but no one gives her threats credibility, nor do they want to, since russia just lost the war basically
  - again, no one takes her seriously, which is a huge mistake.
    - she starts nuking, first one or two cities in northern eastern europe (think western ukraine or poland)
    - then more, quite quickly, without even a realistic chance for a NATO/American nuclear response
      - or tactical counterforce response (some of these details i'm layering onto my dream)
        - not that i'm making shit up, but there were some events/details in the dream that require explaination
          - that we couldn't destroy their nuclear capability in response to their nuclear action in time
            - implies that our counterforce strategies failed
  - and then she continues to nuke more and more cities in europe (around a dozen)
    - i'm in western europe at the time (so probably north of the alps, close to the french/german border)
      - just based on my overall vibe - in the dream i felt safe from nuclear action (at first)
        - but close enough to be absolutely terrified
        - i could see bright flashes that were very distant, but correlated to this dictatress's threats
    - as this is happeneing, her image is broadcasting her threats and she's laughing maniacally
  - the last one that i see go off is very close by (< 100 miles or so) but it's huge.
    - it was specifically mentioned as a hydrogen bomb
    - i tried to take cover in a ditch by the side of the road.  i laid down.
      - i was pretty scared of the radiation and i got nuclear sunburn
      - i felt my skin burn as a result of the radiation.
    - this one was targeted at a major western-european city (i think paris or something like that)
    - the people that i'm with disappear (they don't vaporize or anything) but they aren't around anymore
      - i'm not sure what happened to them.  i was with a military team when it all started happening
      - but i'm alone at this point
  - next thing i know, i'm at a traffic stop and it's complete chaos.  everyone is trying to evacuate.
    - all i know is that i have to get to a university in San Antonio or Austin (somewhere in TX)
    - again, this is immediately after, everything is complete chaos and i was in Europe.
      - but yet, i'm trying to hitch a ride to Texas in a car from Europe...
        - doesn't make sense, but my dream self rationalizes it by transporting me to north central US
          - think Illinois, though i wasn't really sure
      - and all my dream self knows is that i'm trying to head "south" to texas
        - i have a strong overwhelming urge to go there in response to what has happened.
        - there is some reason to go to a university there, some tactical asset that is shielded from events
          - some means of fighting back
  - i get in literally the first car i see with one occupant. it's a smaller car, kind of older and i think red
    - it's nighttime and, again, complete chaos.  everyone is trying to evacuate simultaneously
    - i knock on the door and open it myself.  i quickly explain where i'm going.
      - the driver just has this horridly solemn look on his face (and i'll explain in a second)
      - he agrees and we get on the road and proceed on as we can, though traffic makes that a bit difficult
        - he doesn't really say much when i asked, just kind of motions inward
  - after i wake up, i realize the solemn look was bc he knew that we were both going to die from radiation
    - (i think) and i was the last person he would see before dying
      - he had already concluded that he was going to die and he was just relieved he didn't have to die alone
      - but at the same time, he thought he was going to die alone in the next 12-48 hours with a stranger
    - he had pretty much given up, given the radiation and chaotic circumstances
      - however, even though it appeared both our fates were sealed, iwas too naive - maybe ignorant - to give up
        - it didn't even occur to me that i might die or that i should give pause to that
        - i didn't really care
      - and so, he had shut down basically, but i still had an objective, something to look forward to
        - something greater than myself, to which my own death would be inconsequential

- also, need to write down some of the older dreams that i had
  - Individual Eleven dream (with sephiroth) (this was a christmas morning dream, 1-3 years ago)
  - reflection dream where i saw the two girls (this dream is craaazzyyy bc tatiana)
    - one girl (reflection) i saw but i didn't recognize
    - the other girl her reflection i saw.  and i recognized as she was turning away and it was too late
  - and then there's the crazy ass world war dream i had from when i was like 10 years old or whatever

- dreams where by subconscious is trying to communicate a metaphor to me for the state of my brain
  - lupus dream where i'm reading a book and the pages are flying around
  - columbian drug lord dream where i was floating down a river without enough water
    - everyone else was doing fine (metaphor for blood cells/neurons?)
      -
    - i met my friend (daniel collins) who explained the situation, which i was familiar with
      - we met up before we got in the river (i think? 11/24/15)
    - he started to inject me with artificial blood to smuggle the coke with
    - drug lord tried to kill me with a drill
  - ice skating in canada
  - dream where i was wondering around a bboy jam
    - and there was always "taht one guy" that i would try to battle
      - it seemed this guy was focusing so much negativity towards me
    - i was doing really well (i had made a pretty good bboy comeback) .., but this one guy
      - i would be cyphering and doing some really sick moves
        - there were 3 or four battle circles.
        - i was doing hollows and just occasional power moves
    - i was mostly focusing on teaching others there -- not how to break, but how to learn to break
      - just giving general advice on how to avoid my own mistakes
      - and while i was talking, i was toprock, but mostly focused on dancing for fun
      - having fun while dancing and focused on style.
    - these are some of the things i wanted to teach during the dream
      - not giving up.  having fun.  self-expression.  consistent training and the cost of even just a week break
      - i was trying to talk about my own mistakes and how to avoid them
      - and why learning a skill like breaking is important for learning about life
      - and the most important lesson i wanted to impart was to learn how to learn a skill
    - i could tell that some of the bboy's in the circles were really listening. maybe 20%
      - i could tell that many of the bboys just weren't paying attention.
      - they were focused on the other bboy's at the jam
      - another 20% or so had a look on their face like "why's this has-been telling me how to learn"
    - but there was this one guy that just wanted to destroy me
      - he sought to prove to everyone there that i was a failure and kept trying to call me out
      - he would get into the cypher battle circle, while i was just trying to focus on style
    - and he would bust out power, but then like wrap himself around me
      - it was weird, it was like a visual 3-d distortion, where he spiraled around me
      - when it happened, it would kill my back.  like it felt like my spine was going to break
    - i would shift away and move, and he would do it again and again.
      - i tried moving toanother circle and he just kept following me.
      - when he would wrap himself around me, i would cry out because it felt like my back was going to snap
      - he was putting a ton of physical pressure on my spine.  my spine was curving so much,
        - if i didn't escape, he was going to snap it.  i even yelled out "yo you're going to break my spine!"
    - i don't think this was a metaphor for deality with paggro/hostile people in my life
      - although that's certainly possible
      - i think it was a metaphor for a part of my brain that was/is domineering the rest
        - i feel like there's part of my brain that's failing or pushing out the rest
        - and my brain is trying to subconsciously communicate this to me through metaphors in my dreams
      - i think that the bboy's in the dream are like neurons or parts of my brain
        - and i'm trying to push them to correcting some kind of problem
        - and prevent these parts of my brain from giving up in a hopeless battle against whatever
      - and yet, there's this one guy, this dick that is determined to fuck it all up

  - other dreams:
    - jousting with taylor swift on rolly chairs
      - also hung out with jennifer chang and some guy i don't know in this dream, like at their house
      - we cooked food or something, then me and lots of other people were in a highschool with linoleum floors
        - this is where the rolly chair jousting went down
        - it was more like chicken.  i lost taylor swift won lol.
      - also this dream got really weird shortly after (same night,
        same dream, i thought...) and involve specific people from years ago in my life
        - but we'll just pretend these are separate dreams
        - mng was !@#$'ing some girl in roller skates, in front of a long line of people, just rolling along
          - when he asked her to do it (in front of everyone) she had a look on her face
            - like, she didn't *really* want to, but .. meh, whatever.
            - she was already blowing him in front of everyone
