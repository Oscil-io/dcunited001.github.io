### [Systems Theory - Structure the Incentives and Feedback Loops]()

- brief notes on how this approach to modeling allows you to construct
  systems which are viable and effective in almost any domain
  - business, government, etc
  - it's the intersection of systems theory (biology & business) with
    game theory
  - human and group interactions are all based on motivation, risk,
    reward, goals, feedback loops and communication.
    - and a tiered, multidimension approach towards each of those

- the number one thing we can do is make sure that group incentives
  line up. this single point of information alone might be the most
  valuable nugget in this entire post.
  - make sure individuals and groups know what they want and make sure
    that the people on our side want the same time.
  - if they want something else, see if you can convince them that
    what you want is really the same thing

  - need to motivate the legal and illegal immigrant populations to
    action
    - consequences for illegal immigrants to cooperate can't all be
      negative.
    - seriously, what incentive would an illegal immigrant have for
      putting themselves at risk to cooperate with the system?
    - i don't really know what our options are here... but i'd love to
      explore them and hear what ideas people have

  - what I did here was explain how each class of citizens in america
    actually wants the same thing with regard to illegal
    immigration. even the illegal immigrants! We all want to be
    respected, hard-working citizens of America.
    - when you view these tough issues in that way, then it's not so
      complex. after reenvisioning a tough issue like that and being
      open minded, the next step is to be capable of efficiently
      communicating that to others and cutting through the stifled,
      chaotic dialogue in this country.

- metaphor to a system of a million random 3D vectors of varying
  direction and magnitude.  If you sum a random or almost random
  system of vectors like this, what do you end up with?
  - a very small vector representing the sum of change in the system.
  - just throwing numbers out: the magnitude could be 1/100 to 100
    times the magnitude of the average vector
- now what if that system contains the same number of vectors of a
  similar distribution of magnitude, where they have been reoriented
  so that the face towards mostly the same direction.
  - when you sum them, you get a vector that's somewhere between
    10,000 and 1,000,000 times the magnitude of the original vector
- we all agree that we need changes and we all recognize mostly the
  same set of serious problems in society. Where the left and right
  depart is on proposing solutions to those problems. What I want to
  do is unite the left and the right, so that we can truly accomplish
  something great in America and in the world.

  - sometime soon, i'll write a post on the differences between the
    freedom of the individual and the freedom of the community.
    - particularly, i'll discuss that they are fundamentally at odds
      with each other. individuals should have the freedom to live the
      life they want, without judgement.
      - so we need a system that enables that
      - but small, local communities also deserve the freedom to build
        the community they want and one that
        - and we need a system that allows local communities to depart
          from the mainstream on some social issues
    - but the point here is that the left and the right are at each
      others throats over this stuff. but we need a country that has
      both. the federal government has no business telling you what is
      moral and what is not. they should make laws that enforce
      ethics, but morality is something for individuals, families and
      communities to decide. yet, if communities lack that freedom,
      then we have problems.

  - if we could figure out a system where we have both the freedom of
    the individual and the freedom of the community, where the left
    and right don't have to fight about this, then imagine the
    progress we could make for america.

      When and so when we make people aware that we all know we want
      essentially the same thing,
      - we all want the chance to work hard and be rewarded for that
        hard work,
      - then we can motivate everyone
        to work towards making America greater. We can build it and we
        will be faster, stronger and longer lasting.
