So I watched this video on
[composition in storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=CvLQJReDhic),
which discussed how directors arrange visual elements for shots. And
this sparked my curiosity on several tangents related to the subject,
including architecture and VR.  Specifically, I want to know how film
composition will change for virtual reality.

I enjoy digging into the process of creating something, whether it's
film, art, shoes, business, technology, whatever.  I can't really help
it. I have to think about the process used to create that product or
piece of art.  Whenever I see an ad, I have to think about the
marketing strategy, branding and business model, even if the business
is boring or obscure.  For many businesses, it's easy to imagine and
describe the processes and kinds of roles necessary.

Since film is an industry with a myriad of industries as dependencies,
thinking about film production usually kicks off more introspection
than usual.  For example, I was watching "Clockwork Orange" recently.
There was a showing at the Grandin Theater and it was amazing to see
this film for the first time in theaters.  And, this movie sparks and
drives internal dialogue in the audience about censorship, obsenity,
the role of constraint and morality in society.  But also it has a
particular style of cinematography, including a perculiar approach to
mise en scene. This got me thinking a lot about how the director
sourced locations for these shots, since there seems to be suble
iconography in some of these shots, which add to the depth of the
film's overall message.

So, what is the process used to source these shots? And why does it
seem that this style of mise en film is absent from most movies today?
It seems like it would be difficult and time-intensive to arrange
these shots.  And i posit that it's because, unless used properly, it
would usually detract from the film. Most films that have the
mass-appeal to rake in revenue aren't artistic and
they just don't need this technique. 



- whenever i watch a movie like a clockwork orange,
  - i start wondering how the director sources locations for shots
  - what's the process they use to enumerate and evaluate these locations?



  - how do directors find locations with shots that are used to create compelling image composition?
    - refer to the house at 12:30 in the video
      - this house has a specific layout that enables the shot conveying imbalance
  - this seems like a pretty complicated thing to do
    - you have certain aspects of the story, of the plot and dynamics of the characters 
      - that you want to convey through image composition
    - so first, you need to decide what those are
      - then you need to brainstorm ways of expressing them on-screen
        - i'm guessing this happens mostly at the same time locations are being identified
      - however, knowing what kind of shots you want to frame for individual scenes
        - is very important in deciding locations for those scenes
      - and this is a very complicated optimization problem
        - especially if a location is used for multiple scenes or for a majority of film content
          - that location needs to be capable of providing a myriad of scenarios and room layouts, etc
            - that provide possibilities for applying compositional techniques
        - identifying composition templates used in film certainly helps reduce the complexity of this problem
          - algorithm for analyzing building layouts to determine composition possibilities?
    - then, once you've identified suitable locations,
      - then you can decide how to direct the camera in these scenes 
        - to acheive the composition effects you want
  - would buildings be reused for film?
    - once an iconic, recognizable location has been used in a popular, acclaimed film 
      - this would seem to reduce the incentive for the location to be reused again, at least for some time
      - however, at the same time, if a location has proven its worth,
        - then it seems the location could be reused again

  - so it seems, to some extent, the design of buildings in LA would reflect this need
    - e.g. there's a skating rink in LA that's used for most shots of skating in film over the past few years
      - besides it's location, what makes this rink a good location for film?
      - are there some buildings like this which were designed with image composition in mind?
        - at least, to some extent.  it'd be ridiculous to solely design a building around this.
    - but i wonder to what extent people design floor plans with this in mind?
      - do people study floor plans and schematics of buildings used for critically acclaimed films?

  - and, because limitations seem to enhance creativity, 
    - it seems this problem of designing the composition for shots would be more difficult for pixar
      - designing a scene for computer generated movies would require adding in lots of details
        - changes would be expensive in terms of time
      - so when these computer generated scenes are designed,
        - these general image compositions rules are likely taken into account early on
          - and the shots are designed around rough sketches
        - therefore, image composition is likely used more often in computer generated movies

  - how do these rules change for 3D movies? 
    - for 3D movies, you can control the perspective and viewing frustum at render time
      - this means it's easier to use these effects to accentuate things happening on screen
  - how do they change for VR?
    - how do you create these effects in VR "experiences" if you can't control the perspective of the viewer?
    - what is the equivalent of streaming video in VR?
  - how does this added complexity for a medium of the future affect it's adoption & it's rate of adoption?
    - because of the overwhelming complexity of the medium, 
      - does this limit the capacity of art in the VR medium to convey a consistent message to viewers?
      - or does the complexity only seem overwhelming bc i'm tightly coupling 360 VR video to film
        - and artist will have to explore to discover new forms of expression and new templating techniques,
    - this is similar to the differences between photography and cinematography (and between theatre and film)
      - whereas photography is fixed in time and lacks motion, cinematagraphy needs to take these into account
        - photography does depend on motion, to a degree, 
          - but with cinematagraphy, motion represents an entire dimension
      - so, with 360 VR experiences, the perspective of the viewer and their capacity to move from a fixed position
        - both represent added dimensions of the medium.
    - and so, similar to Alfred Hitchcock's quote that a subjects size on screen should reflect it's importance
      - a subject's positioning in VR medium should also reflect it's importance.
        - yet, it's a bit tougher to control that, so i should disect alfred hitchcock's statement there
    - why is it that size on screen should reflect importance? 
      - to understand this, we need to understand what draws a viewer's attention
      - there's something almost mathematic about this
        - what the director is really trying to control is the probability distribution 
          - of where people are looking during certain key frames in a scene
        - this is so that they can direct the viewer's experience
      - so, if by increasing the size of a subject, 
        - you increase the probability that someone happens to look at that subject
          - then it makes it easier to expect that someone is observing the right things
            - to have the kind of experience you intended
    - so, how does this change for VR? how can you attempt to control the probability distribution here?
      - if a viewer can turn and look anywhere they want, or even shift position,
        - how can you guarantee that a good chunk of your viewers 
          - are going to experience the right thing at the right time?
          - (hint) 3D audio helps alot, but still isn't enough
    - i think that this added complexity will either: 
      - hold back the medium from widespread adoption
      - or force artists to be creative in finding a way to transcend past this limitation
        - which is ironically a limitation created by a lack of limitation
      - so, for example, instead of creating an experience like a film, which is exactly the same every time
        - artists may opt to create a cross between a film and a video game
          - where the experience is event-driven and the characters respond to the viewer's state
            - while being coded to provide as consistent of an experience as possible
  - VR x Theater?!
