So I watched this video on
[composition in storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=CvLQJReDhic),
which discussed how directors arrange visual elements for shots. And
this sparked my curiosity on several tangents related to the subject,
including architecture and VR.  Specifically, I want to know how film
composition will change for virtual reality.

I enjoy digging into the process of creating something, whether it's
film, art, shoes, business, technology, whatever.  I can't really help
it. I have to think about the process used to create that product or
piece of art.  Whenever I see an ad, I have to think about the
marketing strategy, branding and business model, even if the business
is boring or obscure.  For many businesses, it's easy to imagine and
describe the processes and kinds of roles necessary.

Since film is an industry with a myriad of industries as dependencies,
thinking about film production usually kicks off more introspection
than is usual for me.  For example, I was watching "Clockwork Orange"
recently.  There was a showing at the Grandin Theater and it was
amazing to see this film for the first time in theaters.  This movie
sparks and drives an internal dialogue in the audience about censorship,
obscenity, the role of constraint and morality in society.  But also it
has a particular style of cinematography, including a perculiar
approach to mise en scene. This got me thinking a lot about how the
director sourced locations for these shots, since there seems to be
suble iconography in some of these shots, which add to the depth of
the film's overall message.

So, what is the process used to source these shots? And why does it
seem that this style of mise en film is absent from most movies today?
It seems like it would be difficult and time-intensive to arrange
these shots.  And i posit that it's because, unless used properly, it
would usually detract from the film. Most films that have the
mass-appeal to rake in revenue aren't artistic and they just don't
need this technique. Focus on this technique pays off for some films
and some audiences, but not others. It really depends on your market.

### A Mathematic Basis for Mise en Scene

So, what is mise en scene? It's a term in composition that refers to
how the set, actors and cameras coordinate in order to compose the the
visual arrangement of elements on screen. It also applies to theater,
in which case multiple perspectives of the audience need to be taken
into account.  This is why mise en scene in VR will be closer to that
of theater, rather than that of film.  In film, you end up with
having basically composed one moving 2D representation.  Through this,
the audience experiences your vision and derives your message.

However, people are different and, given the same static 2D image,
they will observe different things. Not only will they make different
observations, they will look at entirely different parts of the image.
That's just for a static 2D image.

So what are director's trying to acheive with mise en scene? What are
they trying to optimize? Having studied a bit of neuromarketing -
*it's neuroscience!* - here's the thought that should blow your mind,
as I'm taking something typically considered right-brain and bringing
full-circle to the more analytic left-brain.  I propose that:

> By carefully controlling the arrangement of visual elements, the
> director is trying control the probability distribution, over time,
> of categorized sets of viewers.  This is in an effort to orchestrate
> the experience of diverse categories of audience members.

Sometimes, a picture is worth a thousand words. So here you go. This
is a probability distribution representing where people look in an
image.

TODO: INSERT PICTURE

### Made You Look!

This is one of the most fundamental elements of composition in
film. If you understand what drives people *to look at something*, you
can set them up to be more likely to pay attention to the right
things.  And in such a controversial film as *A Clockwork Orange*,
with a diverse set of viewers, many of whom are disgusted at what is
happening on screen, then utilizing mise en scene is critical in
coordinating their experience.  Many of these viewers would otherwise
be reviling in disgust and looking away, completely missing some
critical aspect of your message.  Imagine if someone watched the first
30 minutes of this film and left.  Being able to anticipate the visual
reaction of homogenous set of viewers is hard.  Being able to control
the experiences of a diverse audience is masterful.

As stated in the video at the top of the article, Alfred Hitchcock
once famously stated that the size of an object on screen should
reflect its importance.  And why is that?  Circling back to my
statement that a director is trying to control the likelyhood of a
viewer paying attention to the right things, then by increasing the
size of someone on screen, then it makes a few things more
likely. First, it becomes more likely that someone would begin to look
at that object and continue to look at it.  Second, it emphasizes
details in that object.  Third, in some viewers with a critical mind,
this may cause them to reflect on the object's size in relation to
other on screen objects.  But, like i said, your audience is diverse
and you can't count on all people to understand such critical facets
of film.

Other factors you can use to influence a viewers attention include
such visual hacks as contrast, focus, blur, color and especially
motion. To understand how to apply these visual hacks, you really need
to understand what drives attention in the human mind, as well as how
we process visual information. These visual hacks can also
detract. This is why mugging is so annoying.  Mugging is when an actor
purposely diverts attention, typically utilizing motion. People can
only pay attention to one thing. For an actor with a small part,
mugging can be tempting because they can try to get a bit more
attention on screen or whatever. Fortunately, everyone knows this
trick.  Actually, your goal is to play the viewers attention to where
it is intended.  Do this and you'll be far better off.

Great, I've digressed into offering my amateur take.

### Composition and Architecture

I will get to VR, but first, I'll take a detour. **Logistics.** That's
the dimension that I find so fascinating about so many subjects that
others seem to miss.  I like to deconstruct the topic I'm assessing by
expounding on the logistic processes required. So, in this case, I'm
thinking about how Stanley Kubrick sourced the locations for his
shots. Obviously, the guy read the book *A Clockwork Orange* and
obviously, he studied the work to understand what it meant and what it
could mean.

- whenever i watch a movie like a clockwork orange,
  - i start wondering how the director sources locations for shots
  - what's the process they use to enumerate and evaluate these locations?



  - how do directors find locations with shots that are used to create compelling image composition?
    - refer to the house at 12:30 in the video
      - this house has a specific layout that enables the shot conveying imbalance
  - this seems like a pretty complicated thing to do
    - you have certain aspects of the story, of the plot and dynamics of the characters
      - that you want to convey through image composition
    - so first, you need to decide what those are
      - then you need to brainstorm ways of expressing them on-screen
        - i'm guessing this happens mostly at the same time locations are being identified
      - however, knowing what kind of shots you want to frame for individual scenes
        - is very important in deciding locations for those scenes
      - and this is a very complicated optimization problem
        - especially if a location is used for multiple scenes or for a majority of film content
          - that location needs to be capable of providing a myriad of scenarios and room layouts, etc
            - that provide possibilities for applying compositional techniques
        - identifying composition templates used in film certainly helps reduce the complexity of this problem
          - algorithm for analyzing building layouts to determine composition possibilities?
    - then, once you've identified suitable locations,
      - then you can decide how to direct the camera in these scenes 
        - to acheive the composition effects you want
  - would buildings be reused for film?
    - once an iconic, recognizable location has been used in a popular, acclaimed film 
      - this would seem to reduce the incentive for the location to be reused again, at least for some time
      - however, at the same time, if a location has proven its worth,
        - then it seems the location could be reused again

  - so it seems, to some extent, the design of buildings in LA would reflect this need
    - e.g. there's a skating rink in LA that's used for most shots of skating in film over the past few years
      - besides it's location, what makes this rink a good location for film?
      - are there some buildings like this which were designed with image composition in mind?
        - at least, to some extent.  it'd be ridiculous to solely design a building around this.
    - but i wonder to what extent people design floor plans with this in mind?
      - do people study floor plans and schematics of buildings used for critically acclaimed films?

  - and, because limitations seem to enhance creativity, 
    - it seems this problem of designing the composition for shots would be more difficult for pixar
      - designing a scene for computer generated movies would require adding in lots of details
        - changes would be expensive in terms of time
      - so when these computer generated scenes are designed,
        - these general image compositions rules are likely taken into account early on
          - and the shots are designed around rough sketches
        - therefore, image composition is likely used more often in computer generated movies

  - how do these rules change for 3D movies? 
    - for 3D movies, you can control the perspective and viewing frustum at render time
      - this means it's easier to use these effects to accentuate things happening on screen
  - how do they change for VR?
    - how do you create these effects in VR "experiences" if you can't control the perspective of the viewer?
    - what is the equivalent of streaming video in VR?
  - how does this added complexity for a medium of the future affect it's adoption & it's rate of adoption?
    - because of the overwhelming complexity of the medium, 
      - does this limit the capacity of art in the VR medium to convey a consistent message to viewers?
      - or does the complexity only seem overwhelming bc i'm tightly coupling 360 VR video to film
        - and artist will have to explore to discover new forms of expression and new templating techniques,
    - this is similar to the differences between photography and cinematography (and between theatre and film)
      - whereas photography is fixed in time and lacks motion, cinematagraphy needs to take these into account
        - photography does depend on motion, to a degree, 
          - but with cinematagraphy, motion represents an entire dimension
      - so, with 360 VR experiences, the perspective of the viewer and their capacity to move from a fixed position
        - both represent added dimensions of the medium.
    - and so, similar to Alfred Hitchcock's quote that a subjects size on screen should reflect it's importance
      - a subject's positioning in VR medium should also reflect it's importance.
        - yet, it's a bit tougher to control that, so i should disect alfred hitchcock's statement there
    - why is it that size on screen should reflect importance? 
      - to understand this, we need to understand what draws a viewer's attention
      - there's something almost mathematic about this
        - what the director is really trying to control is the probability distribution 
          - of where people are looking during certain key frames in a scene
        - this is so that they can direct the viewer's experience
      - so, if by increasing the size of a subject, 
        - you increase the probability that someone happens to look at that subject
          - then it makes it easier to expect that someone is observing the right things
            - to have the kind of experience you intended
    - so, how does this change for VR? how can you attempt to control the probability distribution here?
      - if a viewer can turn and look anywhere they want, or even shift position,
        - how can you guarantee that a good chunk of your viewers 
          - are going to experience the right thing at the right time?
          - (hint) 3D audio helps alot, but still isn't enough
    - i think that this added complexity will either: 
      - hold back the medium from widespread adoption
      - or force artists to be creative in finding a way to transcend past this limitation
        - which is ironically a limitation created by a lack of limitation
      - so, for example, instead of creating an experience like a film, which is exactly the same every time
        - artists may opt to create a cross between a film and a video game
          - where the experience is event-driven and the characters respond to the viewer's state
            - while being coded to provide as consistent of an experience as possible
  - VR x Theater?!
