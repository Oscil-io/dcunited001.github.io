# Neurological Theory of Mind

- There is a neurological theory of mind that marries the material and
  the metaphysical.
  - it defines several tiers of state of information representation:
    immediate, short-term and long-term.

### Immediate State

- immediate state in neural networks is defined by the current state
  of ion flows
  - electrons and waves of electrical spikes moving through the brain
    gradually shape the ion distributions
  - the current state of ion flows are like the values of matrices in
    a neural network on tensor flow

> Comparative mass: Proton is 1837 times heavier than an electron

- electrons are (-1) charge, but their mass is almost 2,000 times
  smaller than a single proton. so, they move much faster through
  neural networks than do the ions.
  - the ions are gradually displaced by the movement of electrons. as
    electrical spikes repeatedly progress through neural networks in
    similar ways, it displaces ions to create new ways for electricty
    to move through neural networks.
    - in this way gating behavior is acheived and modulated.
    - i need to know more about the electrical behavior of ions in
      solution and see simulations of this occuring in neural networks

### Short Term

- ion flows morph to trigger logic-gate like behavior. short-term
  state builds upon these ion flows.
  - these short-term state changes trigger changes in the patterns of
    neurotransmitter release
  - eventually, the neuron's epigenetic program changes, this results
    in permanent state & structure changes to networks of neurons in
    the brain
  - this short-term state is like the holistic state of a neural
    network or subsection of one in a TensorFlow program.
    - (explain this a bit better)

### Long Term

- the structure of neurons act like the riverbeds and canals through
  which ions and action potential impulses can flow.
  - when the structure of neurons is changed permanently, which can
    occur through various kinds of conditioning, this (determines) the
    kinds of ion flows which can occur.
  - the structure of neural networks is similar to the structure of
    tensors in a TensorFlow program.

### Dilineation of Ion Types

- it is the ion types which map to information representation
  - the electrical spikes are important too, but there isn't as much
    information related to state and actual information representation
    there.
  - however, the electrical spikes have to balance out to the charge
    of ions displaced.
- 4 ion types: sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium
  - two categories of ion size (two small and two large)
  - two categories of ion charge (two +1 ions and two +2 ions)
  - not every ion is present everywhere in the brain and various ions
    have different "meanings" in different regions
    - not all ion channels function exactly the same everywhere
      - some are specific to size and some permit all sizes
      - some are specific to charge and some permit all charges

# NLP and Neurological Noise Injection Techniques

- hypnosis techniques encourage the development of particular
  brainwave patterns.
  - but more damaging hypnotic techniques trigger turbulence and
    radical displacement of ions, which is the total destruction of
    immediate and short-term state.

- within this view of NLP techniques can cause ionic turbulence that
  disrupts the persistence of spatiotemporally represented forms of
  information in the brain
