# Neurological Theory of Mind

- There is a neurological theory of mind that marries the material and
  the metaphysical.
  - it defines several tiers of state of information representation:
    immediate, short-term and long-term.

### Immediate State

- immediate state in neural networks is defined by the current state
  of ion flows
  - electrons and waves of electrical spikes moving through the brain
    gradually shape the ion distributions
  - the current state of ion flows are like the values of matrices in
    a neural network on tensor flow

### Short Term

- ion flows morph to trigger logic-gate like behavior. short-term
  state builds upon these ion flows.
  - these short-term state changes trigger changes in the patterns of
    neurotransmitter release
  - eventually, the neuron's epigenetic program changes, this results
    in permanent state & structure changes to networks of neurons in
    the brain
  - this short-term state is like the holistic state of a neural
    network or subsection of one in a TensorFlow program.
    - (explain this a bit better)

### Long Term

- the structure of neurons act like the riverbeds and canals through
  which ions and action potential impulses can flow.
  - when the structure of neurons is changed permanently, which can
    occur through various kinds of conditioning, this (determines) the
    kinds of ion flows which can occur.
  - the structure of neural networks is similar to the structure of
    tensors in a TensorFlow program.


- creek metaphor & 3D FFT
- 4 ion types: sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium
  - two categories of ion size (two small and two large)
  - two categories of ion charge (two +1 ions and two +2 ions)
  - not every ion is present everywhere in the brain and various ions
    have different "meanings" in different regions
    - not all ion channels function exactly the same everywhere
      - some are specific to size and some permit all sizes
      - some are specific to charge and some permit all charges

# NLP and Neurological Noise Injection Techniques

- within this view of NLP techniques can cause ionic turbulence that
  disrupts the persistence of spatiotemporally represented forms of
  information in the brain
