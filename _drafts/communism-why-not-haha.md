=======================================

Please understand that i never meant to publish a lot of this. i put
it all online simply because I thought I might not have a chance to
otherwise and to circumvent being accused of plagarism. Should someone
be or have been sheisty enough to plagarize my work on my file
systems, then publish it on their own, using specific wording in
anticipation that my published documents would mirror that wording
.... welllll then THIS IS SOURCE CONTROL, MY !#%^@

GOTCHA, BITCHES! (probably just being paranoid though. it's actually a
skill! a very, very tragic skill)

Source control tracks all commited history... and no one has time to
dig through git to accurately update history with timestamps while
ensuring unlinked hunks are purged from the repo's. I'm not sure i'm
100% right on this, but I think you have to tell git to purge unlinked
hunks from your repository. So yeh! Even if it doesn't look like it's
in there, it *might* just be in there... hahaha dear God. Seriously
though, anything too gnarly is at home on a fucking sticky note. Which
are unfortunately not source-controlled and/or timestamped. Oh that's
a bummer, eh?

Anyways, please understand this => While I might not support your
political **label**, per se, _I definitely care about your problems._
And, with every last fiber of my being, I intend to continue fighting
until we make things better in the US and in the world. BECAUSE WE
CAN!  And because that's what I always intended to do. That's why I
wanted wealth in the first place. I realized the quickest, most
robust, most failsafe method to get *real change* was to chase a
fucking pot of gold. And the personal development I'd accrue along the
way would be priceless!

The problem is, specific people were terrified I might actually get
there, precisely because they knew why I wanted it!

=======================================

- why communism is bullshit and is its own antithesis
  - why north korea isn't communinist (it's
    autocratic/military/monarchy) and why N.K. should be a synonym for
    full of shit
  - north koreans obviously aren't allowed to study government.
    otherwise, they would know exactly how oxymoronic and
    [synonym for word-missing-the-meaning] they are
  - why i slightly respect chinese communism (but why it's not exactly
    communism)
  - what's required for communism to work and why this inherantly
    plants the seeds of its own destruction
    - the agencies required for surveillance gain the power and
      motivation for more power
    - I.E. the KGB subverting communism into oligarchy to magnify
      their own power.

=======================================

Let me emphacize that I have a problem with a society architected to
dispense retribution to anything but unwavering, unquestioning
obedience, regardless of that person's integrity or how much value
they have contributed. It's sickening, honestly. This is precisely how
communism corrodes and deteriorates value systems in a society over
the course of several generations.

If you look for the communism's butterfly effect event, you'll find
it's invisible cascades unfolding in late 19th century Easern European
politics. Most likely.  Particularly, you should find social
engineering that sowed the seeds of the Bolshevik revolution, decades
ahead of Anastasia's demise. But most important to such a revolution
are the seeds sown to degrade and demoralize Russia. While I'm no
scholar on communism, if you look at late 19th academia in Eastern
Europe, you should find many intellectuals who attempted to undermine
establishment institutions through cleverly-disguised, duplicitous
policies.

Multi-faceted duplicity is the key as wise rulers with generations of
experience aren't going to fall for just anything. And my argument is
that we are seeing exactly that in America and have been, since the
end of World War II. Honestly, since well before that! The movement
for Communism in America has always been creeping socialism.

=======================================

Why #Socialism fails: it requires a strong economy to provide
expensive benefits for everyone, yet culturally degrades the virtues
that create a strong economy.  This inevitably leads to the loss of
values and, eventually the wealth itself, that would lead such a
situation to be possible.  The best answer for governance is not
actually as straightforward as "sunshine, unicorns and icecream for
everyone."

[Plato's Five Regimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_five_regimes)

Sorry, you're #Myopic - you're simply not thinking of the future.

Fortunately, the price of these problematic services (such as
healthcare) will plummet, regardless of public policy. However, it's
infuriating to see both of the following: the demagogue politicians
who promise such grand reforms, full-well knowing that these reforms
represent changing economics moreso than real change; and their
followers, ignorant of the true causes of their suffering, who foist
their chosen demagogues up as some kind of salvation, without
understanding that their ideology will soon be irrelevant.

What I'm trying to say: your politics are about as useful as an
umbrella in a hurricane. Far more powerful forces will determine the
course of policy over the next decade or two. The only question is
.....

- can i have your cornbread?
- who will control this newfound power and what will they do with it?
- ... ?

subversive long-term political strategy of the left:
- push conservatives out of their jobs, especially those that are
  vocal or tend to make political contributions
- shutter small businesses, forcing those businesses owners to
  encounter financial problems.  small business owners are typically
  conservatives bc why the fuck would they not be?
  - that makes small business owners less likely to make conservative
    political contributions
  - additionally, this exacerbates economic woes in america
    - the upper middle class shrinks
    - the middle class shrinks
  - but the best part (for the left) is that means that the evil
    corporations further dominate the economy, gobbling up the market
    share of closed small businesses
    - this means it's game with fewer players
      - those players will push for policies that will motivate the
        base on the left
    - in an economy where most of the former middle class moves to
      lower economic status, more and more people sympathize with the
      policies on the left
- small businesses and the middle class need to be protected
  - if a government agency inserts toxic people into a small business
    or exerts leverage over an employee of a small business to spread
    toxicity and/or negatively affect their operations (i.e liaison
    officers or people whom liaison officers exert leverage over)
    - small businesses, specifically, are going to be less equipped to
      respond.
      - they have smaller budgets, fewer resources, often lacking an
        HR department or fair & equally applied policies
    - this just means that, even if the government is targeting all
      businesses (small, medium and large) equally, then small
      businesses are more prone to being negatively affected
- my main point is OMFG if HomeSec is doing this kind of shit, i want
  to vomit!! for so many reasons:
  - the biggest of which is that: the economy and stability in the
    economy (even at a micro scale - just looking at individual small
    businesses) is a major, major factor in HomeSec
    - in other words, politically oriented manipulation of this agency
      runs completely counter to its goals!!
  - and especially if that manipulation results in action in
    congress or by the american people!! since there are legitimate
    reasons for this agency, if the american people need to stand up
    to it because a political force is abusing it, then taking
    (well-justified!!) action against such shenenigans results in a
    less secure america
    - THANKS OBAMA

how/why the left encourages transition to socialism
- socialism only works as long as an economy functions and as long as
  the government has money for such services
  - as soon as there's no money or there's significant economic
    turbulence, then you have an angry population who lacks any
    understanding as to why they can't:
    - buy food or participate in the economy or go to school
    - even have schools... yada yada
- so, by encouraging policies which exacerbate long-term problems, the
  left is basically damning america,
  - while motivating large populations of lower class people to clamor
  for those same policies,
  - which they aren't educated enough to understand the long term
    costs of those policies

we're in an economic situation today that's different than any other
in history,
- where game theory and our current & destination economic state
  - economic state as in aggregation/allocation of resources & intellectual property
  - this means we're inevitably headed towards a world where resources
    will be increasingly allocated to a smaller group of people
- it's nearly inevitable, that is.
  - we have to understand how to dismantle the conditions that create
    poverty, so citizens in the lower class can have access to
    opportunities that can change their lives
    - the free community college, IMO, is a great example of a policy
      which can be life-changing for those who might not have very
      many options.
      - it doesn't cost much and won't leave the people who fail with
        the burden of student loans
      - in spite of the fact that such a policy goes against my
        conservative views that government services should be limited
        - in this case, it gives people who are talented enough or who
          work hard enough to change their lives, if basically, they
          just work hard enough

why we don't want a revolutionary change in political/economic power
- because many of the reasons why modern society has not collapsed and
  why western society was able to develop to the point that it has can
  be DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED to many of the policies that the left rails
  against and uses to motivate their base.
  - therefore, these policies are necessarily bad or motivated with
    an intent of greed or power, regardless of the pain some of these
    policies have inflicted on lower classes
  - many of these policies and tactics were instead motivated with a
    desire to retain stability
    - and most importantly TO RETAIN THE CAPACITY OF OUR SOCIETY TO
    CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ENOUGH TECH TO AVOID AN OVERPOPULATION
    CATASTROPHE
- because revolutions (especially if there is warfare involved) can
  lead to a situation where someone comes to power who is ill-equiped
  with the experience to lead with adequate long-term vision
  - they simply lack the experience (developed over the course of
    generations) that enables the wisdom required to rule and to
    promote/retain stability
  - exemplia gratia: the french revolution and resulting jacobinist
    chaos
    - the "reign of terror"
      - [Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier),
        the "father of modern chemistry" was executed
    - lots of turmoil after the French Revolution, leading to the rise
      of Napolean, a dictator gaining momentum on the promise of a
      return to French prominence (.... nevermind)
      - corsica (cheech and chong)
