### galactic ethics

- how to determine whether a planet is ever going to host life in the
  future?
  - how to know this with certainty if we aren't aware of all the kind
    of life there could be?
- the importance of having that discussion
- this is why we can't screw up over the next few hundred years
  - we've basically got one shot and just enough resources
  - overpopulation will consume us if we fail
  - and it might thousands of years before humanity has another chance
- if humanity were to become extinct, then it might be millions of
  years before there was another species that could evolve
  intelligence to escape earth
  - if that species doesn't have enough hydrocarbon fuels, then it
    might not progress to the point where it can develop more advanced
    technology
  - and right out of the gate, that intelligent, aware species would
    pretty much be damned to the curse of overpopulation
- what if earth has already been host to multiple intelligent life
  forms that have evolved and disappeared
  - if so, then how would we know?
    - one way is to look at the rate and distribution of elements and
      isotopes throughout the earth.
  - there are some interesting coincidences about the
    geography/climite of the poles.
    - when the poles melt to a specific degree, it opens/closes ocean
      current that change weather patterns (that's known and incidental)
      - it will also trigger the release of bacteria and pathogens
        mostly unknown to the world
      - (scifi) that could be an instance of planned, event-driven
        terreforming.
        - i.e. once the pole melt, it trigger the release of bacteria,
          which cause some terraforming effect
        - this could be engineered

==========

- is there gravitational wave radiation?
- gravity doesn't exert a spherical effect on spacetime (?)
  - well need to put multiple gravity wave detection devices in
    orbit around jupiter
  - ideally we'd have these devices in multiple galaxies and
    then we'd see that a gravitational wave does not appear to
    eminate from a single source because it's energy was
    redirected when it propagated through a densely curved
    region of space
  - this might give us an idea of the viscosity of spacetime, if
    actually acts like fluid
    - THE ETHER IS REAL!
- gravity is seen as the force between two or more
  objects
- but it's actually more indirect than that. it's the pull of
  those objects on space and the collective effect on the
  space between them.
- the space absorbs the energy. (?)
  - so if a gravitational wave runs through a large mass (really
    needs to a galaxy)
- it should change direction as the curvature of large objects warps
  space.

# specifics of quantum entanglement based design

- describe the variations in how particles would develop & retain
  entanglement as universe develops past inflation.
  - how is matter distributed in the early universe?
    - it's important because if matter can retain a history of
      entanglement, then it would become more entangled with adjacent
      matter as it expands outwards
      - it could expand as a ring, or a sphere?
      - what does space look like in the center?
      - what happens to that space after inflation?

    - it would become entangled with less and less matter as time goes on
    - once gases merge into stars, those sets of entangled particles
      would become mostly isolated and the history of entanglement
      would be "overwritten" as the newer entanglements are much more
      frequent
      - if the phenomena is possible, then this fact could allow us to
        detect the foreign entanglements from before the matter formed
        a star.

- it would be like two civilizations simultaneously developing *basic*
  radio technology 1000-4000 years ago
  - in otherwords, they had prehistoric ham radios
  - they could come online and they share a common communication
    medium. bc of universal language

- this is a fascinating idea about the radios, but i'm pretty sure it
  never happened ... just to clarify
  - requires a degree of precision in manufacturing parts
    - requires math that didn't exist to explain electromagnetism
    - i.e. maxwell, advanced calculus, etc.
  - requires understanding of targeting a radio signal and designing
    antennae to transmit/receive radio signals
  - more to the point, if this did happen, it would show up in the
    evolution of language and culture.
  - but... if it did happen... that'd be cool.
    - one civilization could equip others with tech to quickly
      broadcast tech
    - it would probably explain how there's a mummy in egypt that
      tested positive for cocaine residue. we can finally lay that
      mystery to rest.

- protocol would reflect of apex of quantum-entanglement based
  communication.
  - this is bc, if the tech permitted us to instantaneously connect
    with other civilizations within a neighborhood of distance d,
    - and if the tech didn't require physical contact to link
      entangled particles
    - then we could assume that alien civilizations would want to use
      the most efficient/secure/etc networking protocol.
      - it would resolve to some perfect aspect of quantum mechanics,
        like plank length or sequenced on a time period that is exact
        multiples of chronons
    - and because we can assume that there is some universal language
      that emerges from mathematics (reference post), we can also
      assume that aliens would want to use whatever language that is
      to communicate.
      - this further helps them avoid establishing physical contact
        to communicate

- everyone imagines exploring the universe a la star trek, with a
  fleet of majestic space ships. but no. nope. no enterprise.
  - no, were just gonna hang back on earth and kick it. we don't have
    to fight the borg... we'll send them lolcat videos and they'll
    send us cute lolborg videos and memes that say "destroy all
    kitties"

- if everything was entangled... or lots of things...
  - then there would be an other half to the equation
  - that is, everything is connected (or lots of things), so wouldn't
    any effect on one particle dissipate its effects to the rest of
    the entangled particles? and if so, how?
    - couldn't this be used as an "other half" to an equation?
    - but how could it, if you couldn't know that everything was
      connected? and yet, it should be impossible for everything to be
      connected because when matter formed directly after the big
      bang, it couldn't all be adjacent
    - but if some matter is connected on a large scale, how can we
      determine how those large sets overlap? can we average things
      out?

- impossible to discern the origin of the signal
  - location undiscernable.
  - and time? simultaneous. this might produce wierd counter-intuitive
    effects that contrast relativity
    - does this say anything about the nature of space?

Astronomy as a means for recognizing reincarnation ... somehow
- but... how?
