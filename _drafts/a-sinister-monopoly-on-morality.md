a sinister monopoly on morality

analogy of summary of cameras in real life as similar to the summary
of your field of view with raytraced reflections included.
- if you look around
- that is, a computer system which is capable of viewing the video
  from any camera or comprehending the 3D space of any combination of
  cameras for which their field of vision overlaps
  - this can be combined with temporal statistical modeling algorithms
    which allow such a system to track objects or make inferences
    about actions
- this forms the eyes of an entity that surrounds the world and can
  become aware of everything, provided it has the infrastructure to
  share it's data across the world and the computational capacity to
  make those insights from it's awareness
  - however, the more data it processes, the more it can reduce the
    computational capacity to produce the same quality of information

a group of people who has control over such an entity posess knowledge
of pretty much anything that happens and can almost tap into your
thoughts.
- everytime you meet someone, it's probably on camera, if that piece
  of information isn't already deducable from a dozen other signals,
  like GPS and cell tower triangulation
- therefore, it becomes almost impossible to trespass against the
  state or do anything the state deems wrongful.
  - the state defines what is right and what is wrong.
  - a state or group of people that possess power over such an
    apparatus practically cannot be denied.
  - from here, they can balkanize the internet to fracture and shard
    the dissemination of information to further confuse the populous.
- but basically, the stat has a sinister monopoly on morality.
  - this is an incredibly dangerous thing, but yet it is inevitable
    because of economic pressures. it is simply inevitable that we
    will reach a system similar to this one.
  - there's really no way to plan for another kind of world because if
    we don't have this technology to aid us, we will be DAMNED by
    overpopulation! that kind of world is much darker
    - at least with technology, we will have the capacity to escape
      this planet's limit for resources. we'll have the ability to
      control our own destiny
      - instead of being controlled by overpopulation and the terrible
        effects that a world populated by 10-15 billion people would
        have on our cultures
- so instead of planning to act against it, we need to plan to act
  responsibly to determine how such a world would be built to benefit
  all of us.

in such a world, it's important to defend older religious traditions
in this atmosphere because either political atheism or another
tradition might try to replace them.
- however, widespread political atheism almost always promotes an
  social environment that develops a cult of personality.  the so
  called "opium of the masses" is really just something people seek
  from culture and from life. they seek purpose and meaning. there are
  different institutions that can try to provide that.
  - so instead of claiming these ancient cultural institutions are
    meaningless, we should try to defend them. they represent the
    accumulation of knowledge across dozens or hundreds of
    generations!
    - why would we replace them with something inferior that would
      represent only a generation or two of experience at the most?
