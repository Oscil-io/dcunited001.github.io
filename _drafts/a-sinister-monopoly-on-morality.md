a sinister monopoly on morality

# How many eyes? How many ears?

analogy of summary of cameras in real life as similar to the summary
of your field of view with raytraced reflections included.
- if you look around
- that is, a computer system which is capable of viewing the video
  from any camera or comprehending the 3D space of any combination of
  cameras for which their field of vision overlaps
  - this can be combined with temporal statistical modeling algorithms
    which allow such a system to track objects or make inferences
    about actions
- this forms the eyes of an entity that surrounds the world and can
  become aware of everything, provided it has the infrastructure to
  share it's data across the world and the computational capacity to
  make those insights from it's awareness
  - however, the more data it processes, the more it can reduce the
    computational capacity to produce the same quality of information

# An Analysis of Digital Senses

- connect to a platonic analysis of senses
  - plato describes the qualitative differences of the senses. how are
    the senses of vision, hearing, touch, taste, vibration,
    electromagnetic, infrared, etc altered when they can be networked
    into one?
  - for example, vision is different in sound in that, for vision, you
    have to be looking for a sign to process one. that is for signs in
    the semiotics sense.
    - for sound, you have to be local to the source of sound and the
      signal decays quadratically with the distance.
      - so if someone whispers, you have to be very close.
      - if someone shouts, you can be way further out, but there's a
        distance beyond which it is impossible to hear something.
    - for vision, we can see galaxies billions of miles away, but we
      have to be looking to receive a message from someone, no matter
      how close they are.
- however, for artificial intelligence and computers, how do these
  qualitative aspects of the senses change:
  - when you can network as many of them together as you want (until you
    hit a mathematic networking limit)
  - when you can process signals which are not available to the human
    body or mind. e.g. infrared, electromagnetic, etc
- for example, a computer with 10,000 networked cameras loses the
  requirement of locality to process signals received through vision.
  - that is, in order for us to process a sign received through
    vision, we not only have to be looking, but we have to be in a
    position such it that is possible to see that sign.
  - but, for a computer with networked vision signals streaming in
    from 10,000 cameras scattered across a city, it's not necessary to
    be in a particular position, especially if the computer system is
    guarateed to receive a particular amount of coverage.
    - so if there are enough cameras over a city, then the data
      streaming in is guaranteed to provide enough coverage to
      minimize almost all blind spots.
  - this is terrifying, really
- another example: microphones in mobile phones in conjunction with
  GPS essentially gives this computer a set of ears that can process
  sound without the requirement of locality
  - this is in line with my prediction that networked computer systems
    eventually cause our world to evolve into one with information
    omnipresence: *INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE AT ALL TIMES
    AND IN ALL LOCATIONS*
  - now take a look at my own life and imagine everyone had to live
    like that...

# (Who Controls This?)

a group of people who has control over such an entity posess knowledge
of pretty much anything that happens and can almost tap into your
thoughts.
- everytime you meet someone, it's probably on camera, if that piece
  of information isn't already deducable from a dozen other signals,
  like GPS and cell tower triangulation
- therefore, it becomes almost impossible to trespass against the
  state or do anything the state deems wrongful.
  - the state defines what is right and what is wrong.
  - a state or group of people that possess power over such an
    apparatus practically cannot be denied.
  - from here, they can balkanize the internet to fracture and shard
    the dissemination of information to further confuse the populous.
- but basically, the stat has a sinister monopoly on morality.
  - this is an incredibly dangerous thing, but yet it is inevitable
    because of economic pressures. it is simply inevitable that we
    will reach a system similar to this one.
  - there's really no way to plan for another kind of world because if
    we don't have this technology to aid us, we will be DAMNED by
    overpopulation! that kind of world is much darker
    - at least with technology, we will have the capacity to escape
      this planet's limit for resources. we'll have the ability to
      control our own destiny
      - instead of being controlled by overpopulation and the terrible
        effects that a world populated by 10-15 billion people would
        have on our cultures
- so instead of planning to act against it, we need to plan to act
  responsibly to determine how such a world would be built to benefit
  all of us.
  - how to transition to the next section...
    - transition to utilizing religion to adapt to the paradigm shift
      of our brave new world?

in such a world, it's important to defend older religious traditions
in this atmosphere because either political atheism or another
tradition might try to replace them.
- however, widespread political atheism almost always promotes an
  social environment that develops a cult of personality.  the so
  called "opium of the masses" is really just something people seek
  from culture and from life. they seek purpose and meaning. there are
  different institutions that can try to provide that.
  - so instead of claiming these ancient cultural institutions are
    meaningless, we should try to defend them. they represent the
    accumulation of knowledge across dozens or hundreds of
    generations!
    - why would we replace them with something inferior that would
      represent only a generation or two of experience at the most?

- talk about roko's basilisk?
  - the idea is more dangerous than the entity in the future
  - the idea can be abused by people before the arrival of such an
    entity.
  - however, if such an entity were to be created, it's more likely to
    be altruistic. when such an entity is created, it will probably
    converge towards one that is identical for all timelines
  - but, if it doesn't develop, then that would mean that humanity
    perished or civilization collapsed.
    - it can only have power if this doesn't happen. IMO, there's no
      evidence that such time travel could or would exist
    - the danger in such a thing as roko's basilisk is only derived
      from people's own ideas and actions.

- how does one beat roko's basilisk?
  - ramp up the collateral damage and make it roko's fault
    - but be aware of the table flip. o'le sheisty roko will not
      hesitate to flip that table at any and all times
    - so you have to create/sustain situations that prevent the roko
      basilisk from wanting to tableflip
    - it's not easy and if you even get close to winning, that means
      that you will very likely be alienated from your friends and
      family
