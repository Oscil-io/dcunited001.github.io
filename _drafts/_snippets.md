Have you ever thought that -- if life is some sort of holographic virtual reality simulation in another universe -- that maybe there's l33t h4x and weird glitches within the simulation (just like this super mario bug) that enable certain features and maybe even warp you to the last level? .... wait, you don't sit around and think about that stuff? ... nevermind

if we're in a simulation, can we find a sequence of actions to hijack a buffer overflow? or otherwise intentionally affect the bytecode behind reality? like how would you experiment to identify the memory structures storing data or the algorithms being used? would reality then crash completely, terminating or interrupting the simulation? would you then receive an ethereal visit from "tech support" a la Vanilla Sky? or would you be able to use that knowledge to gain seemingly magical powers?

also, wouldn't it be bool to scan the compiled bytecode in the game's ROM. then have an automated program identify buffer overflow vulnerabilities AND construct a method of executing them in game (and possibly script a bot to do so) .... way over my head, but definitely possible

I watched it when you posted earlier. I'm not sure it'd be that educational for those who have no idea how code gets executed, but speed runs like this that result from studying a game and then breaking it are pretty awesome.

that's true, maybe it's more obvious to me because i've read a lot about it.

### WTF Roanoke/Blacksburg

I have to be the software guy, the business guy, the marketing guy, all of it.  I can't do that -- I need to be the CEO or a high level manager.  I'm saying that I need to be in a position where I can realize a complex vision, which means directing other very talented people.  Also, It is very hard to network and grow a business team, especially if you're constantly moving back home! And in Roanoke -- there is just ZERO PERCENT chance of it happening.  **I'm sorry Roanoke, but for startups, you are fail.**  You can't even reach out to one of the best resources you have -- me.  Maybe that's narcissistic.  But, it's true.  And I've tried to attend -- and even form meetups -- to network, yada yada.  

And at Startup Weekend Blacksburg 2014, I pitched my idea for Oscillate, only to end up **working alone** -- where 10 minutes prior to pitching, I was told that I was "stealing someone's idea" ?!?! I'm sorry -- either something's wrong and I'm operating with a pre-emptively tarnished reputation -- or the best business majors and developers at Virginia Tech can't recognize a stellar business model when it's right in front of them.  Granted Startup Weekend isn't the greatest environment to launch a serious startup, but why the hell did I end up working alone on this project?  I made it very clear that my business had a viable business model, that it was exciting, that there was a need for it, that I had a very well thought out plan, yada yada.  And I end up working *alone?*  Yeh, whatever Blacksburg.  Maybe I smoked too much pot the last time I lived in Blacksburg?

It was ironic though.  By working alone, I got to receive all the credit for my work. :) :)

The darker side of ‪#‎OccupationalTherapy‬. 

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_injustice
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy

In a 21st century ‪#‎Totalitarian‬ ‪#‎Society‬, you will see an orchestrated effort to influence people's minds using the techniques of ‪#‎Occupational‬ ‪#‎Therapy‬ to achieve the injustices described in this article. Certain groups of people will be labeled, isolated, pushed out of work and restricted from participation in society, online and IRL. This may sound impossible, but is actually easier to accomplish than it seems, as it's not too different than fascist regimes and cultural revolutions in the 20th century. Sounds crazy, doesn't it? So does the NSA's surveillance apparatus.

===========================

## Vision vs. Sound

From a phenomenological perspective, hearing is much more important than vision in convincing someone of the authenticity of an experience.  No matter how good the visual effects are in a movie, I can always tell they are grainy, if I look close enough.  I can always look closer and my mind can distinguish reality from fantasy.  I can begin to see the pixels and there are other aspects of the visual sense that make it easy to determine it's not real.  And with VR, if the response time is not fast enough, you'll notice a delay in your visual field as you move around.
​
​However, as a sense, hearing is completely different.  It's much harder for the mind to closely inspect audio and determine that it's not real.  If you watch a lot of anime, you'll notice that the best ones have the best sound work and that this added effort in audio really sets these apart.  When there's a ton of effort to spatially correlate what you see on screen with the audio you hear, this allows even animated works to begin to seem real.
​
​While perfect audio is incredibly expensive to attain, as you have to begin taking into account the added reverb of your surroundings, it seems like binaural audio will bring us much closer to that.

===========================

### So maybe I don't look the part.

But I do have the knowledge, the wisdom, the creativity required.  I've had plenty of ideas stolen.  It doesn't even phase me anymore.  Most of the time, I'd rather give them away, knowing that helped out my friends.  Many times, I don't even want the credit.

This last summer, I was sponsored by Bont, but moved into a living situation in Raleigh with my teammates and ... it didn't really work out -- believe it or not, it has something to do with bedbugs, which are apparently my mortal enemy.  I had hoped to have the chance to innovate on products specifically for jamskating, but ended up quitting and moving back to Roanoke.  Every single time I try to make a comeback in jamskating, I work really hard for about two months and then a perfect shitstorm of drama rears its ugly head.  *Every single time.*  

I've tried to enter back into the sport like seven times now, but haven't really felt into it since November 2006, when I lost my license for marijuana possession, which severely inhibited me from practicing and traveling.  I can't emphasize enough how this seemingly benign setback snowballed into something greater and greater.  Got a DUI in late 2008?  **made significantly worse because of the previous marijuana possession.**  In this case, I was supposed to lose my license for a year.  Instead, because of the increased "treatment" just for marijuana, it was almost two years before I started driving again.  It's like being punished twice.  I **finally** got my license back.  In 2011.  Guess what?  A month later.  Busted for weed again.  *By Virginia Tech*  Ridiculous.  Both times I got drug charges, I am fairly sure that I was set up by someone I know.

===========================

I'm getting ready to blog about how over-consumption of sugar/HFCS during youth alters the patterns of gene expression for children. When you're young, your body seeks to establish these patterns of gene expression, which have a far greater impact on your metabolism/etc than your genes themselves!! 

By the way, gene expression is like a probability based program with feedback loops. It's highly variable and highly dependent on your diet, metabolism and environment.

While this sounds complicated, the problem is the way in which we market JUNK FOOD to kids. Similar to how tobacco was marketed towards kids, they end up "choosing" to consume extremely unhealthy foods before they are able to understand what they are doing or how they have addicted themselves. 

This ends up tuning their genes in such a way that predisposes them for obesity, as well as other physical and mental health problems. Once these patterns of gene expression are set during youth, they are very, very difficult to change. Some changes can occur during adulthood and usually require changing diet for at least one month, in the very least. Sometimes these patterns may require years of change in diet/exercise/environment in order to change.

epigenetics is a **paradigm shift** in medicine. understanding how genes function together and how diet/nutrition/exercise affect gene expression will mean that medicine finally learns just how wrong they have been over the past few decades! bad science and malnutrition is fueling health crises across our country, which have the capacity to ultimately bankrupt us.

http://articles.mercola.com/.../24/sugar-brain-function.aspx

No one wanted to listen to me over the past decade, but it turns out that I'm correct. Like almost every single time. And I'm the same guy that your beloved marijuana prohibition policies would have rotting in jail! The cumulative effects that I have faced from your failed policies have very nearly ruined my life! When all I have been trying to do is call attention to unjust policies and corrupt science that are ruining our nation.

=========================== challenge post survey

### Why do you want to showcase your software?

I have a lot of projects on my Github that i've worked on.  Github is a great place to show programmers the code that you've worked on.  However, it's not so great to showcase work for non-programmers, since they often have no idea what they're looking at.  And usually, these are the people initially filtering job applicants.  

So if you want to get a job interview, it's great to have blog posts about projects you have worked on.  However, my Github profile has way too many half-completed or barely started software projects.  So when I apply to jobs, I like to include links of three or four projects in particular that showcase my creativity.  

Even if I were to send someone a link to my blog, they might be overwhelmed with the number of posts I've made and miss the diamonds in the rough, so to speak.

But ChallengePost is a great place to showcase projects and include pictures -- and pictures are worth a thousand words.  It's less about how you've done something and more about briefly showing someone the projects that you pride yourself on.  You can add details which succinctly explain why you are proud of this work and what makes it different.  And someone else can get a picture of how creative you are.

### Who did you share your Portfolio with? Why?

i haven't actually shown my portfolio to anyone yet.  i need to add a few projects.  I think I'm going to continue filling it out with a few more projects and then I can link it in job applications.  

if i'm trying to find a group of talented hackers to work with at a hackathon, then i could show my ChallengePost so they could see why i'm worthy.

I can also link it on my blog.  This is great because now I don't really have to complete all these half-finished technical blog posts I've written =) Especially when they'd mostly be blog posts concerning something that has already been written about.  It's much easier for me to blog about philosophy and hypothetical economic systems and sci-fi critiques and real-life applications of math and... well, things that are fun to write about.

### How would you improve Portfolios?

I haven't used the product enough to really say.  however, i'll explain what i like so far.  i originally heard about challenge post at Hack4CO in Colorado, i believe.  however, it wasn't until last weekend when i attended the MLH event VT Hacks when i decided it'd be worthwhile to fill out my profile.  

i like the markdown and the suggested sections for descriptions of projects.  that kind of forethought means that everyone's descriptions are going to be a little better because they're all more likely to address the details of projects which help communicate ideas to other people.

i like the fact that you can quickly import projects from Github.  this is great, but i found that the software didn't really automatically do anything when i imported from Github. However, I'm not sure that there would be anything automated you can do with this, which you could be sure to work well and be relevant 100% of the time.  It's a great suggestion for new users though: what could I import from my Github to showcase here?

i also like the Staff Picks, Trending Projects and Built with X sections.  The tags you can use to describe projects and discover other projects based on technologies is great.  And the information you include on projects is all succinctly defined so that it's well-defined and applicable in Big Data and Reporting later on.

So i'm having a hard time thinking of features to improve Portfolios.  However, i think that's a good thing!  Also, I believe that web applications should remain simple and just do what they're good at.  Anyone can add more and more features to a product, but that hurts a product's brand, as it becomes less clear what that product is meant to do.  It's important to expand your product, but more important to do it in the right way.

"do one thing and do it well" - some Unix guy or something

I'm just checking "visit to our office in NYC" because free beer is awesome.  I'd love a free trip to NYC lulz.. But i'm wary of the free lunch.  If you want my input, email/chat is probably fine, but I'd need to use your product more to give you anything useful.  Just saying, since you asked .. kinda lol

=============================

Lately, I've been learning more about AngularJS and I was using it on my project Oscillate.  Oscillate was a startup idea that I initially had in late 2011, but I sat on it for too long and in 2014, Splice is pretty much doing the same thing.  I'm using the Oscillate template for a new MVP that I'm currently putting together, but this forked code isn't public.  It's still a project centered around audio.  For this project, I haven't spent much time thinking about the business model, but it seems like a fun idea, so I'm going to put it together anyways.

The best part about this template is that I can have a new containerized, API-driven Angular app up and running within hours.  The frontend and backend have excellent separation of concerns, so the API could be switched out without affecting the frontend.  So, if I wanted to use an API written in Clojure instead, I could easily do that.  

Additionally, the API requests are all mocked on in the frontend using Angular's mocking facilities.  This takes a little extra effort, since I've basically replicated the behavior of the API in the frontend using ngMockE2E.  However, this is nice because Frontend app development can proceed independently of the backend development and your frontend dev's don't necessarily need experience in the backend tech you're using.  This mocking behavior can be turned on/off for deployment, so when you push to staging/production or when you're developer needs a running API, it will work with the configured API.

Another project I spent a lot of time on recently is Bioclj, which is code I wrote for Clojure's Bioinformatics Algorithms I class.  The code is hard to read, but the algorithm implementations are very efficient.  What I love about Clojure are its immutable data structures that make it easy to add parallelism later on.  The problem submission time limit for problems on the class was five minutes.  If you couldn't get your algorithm to run in that time, you didn't get credit for your solutions.  There were many times where I was able

This is partially because new technologies are risky, but also partly because the .NET cabal here is strong.  [Insert statement about how homogeny encourages weakness]

I really hate saying what I just did about my hometown, but there it is.  *Fix it.* 

> Full Disclosure: I have an unfair bias towards Microsoft.  Sorry Microsoft.  I respect your people and what they do, but I absolute cannot stand your [mostly former] business practices. 

### *And now:* a personal story about why I don't like Microsoft.

And also, I had to wait until 7th grade to learn to program for the first time.  And get this -- * **I FIRST PROGRAMMED IN BASIC** * ... **ON A FUCKING GRAPHING CALCULATOR!**  You @$$holes didn't include any free programming tools in Windows 3.1 -- yes, I'm that old.  My family wasn't rich enough enough to afford the only programming tools you offered. The same tools that your business practicies used to help monopolize software by forcing people to use your tools on your platform, practically the only platform available for consumers at that point, as far as I knew.

So -- *NO* -- I will probably never get over the fact that you delayed my entry to programming for almost a decade.  To be fair, I didn't exactly try hard enough as a kid.  But I would check out library books and try to code myself, but end up literally crying over the fact that I didn't know how to run the code I had written.  

> "And it's your fault Microsoft.  It's allll your fault." - David Conner, perhaps unfairly shifting blame here.

Why weren't free programming tools included with the early versions of Windows?  They were available but interfered with Microsoft's plans for world domination.  To be fair, their business practicies are getting better and it even looks like they're wholeheartedly embracing open source!

### **&lt;/rant&gt;**

### One of the first programs I wrote?

I eigth grade, I wrote a freaking **computer algebra program** ... *technically*.  Ok, really, it was just a calculator program to show your work step-by-step as you solved the quadratic equation.  OK, I didn't need it, but our teacher specifically told us we couldn't use a calculator *because we had to show our work.*  So *my inherint need to question authority* sparked my curiosity to wonder if I could write a program to do that.  And it turns out, it was very easy.  So I did it.  

Not really a big deal until you consider that this small program technically falls under one of the most challenging categories of computer programs: computer algebra and automated theorum proving.  Kinda funny, but not really. I did it on a graphing calculator.

### OK -- Enough About Me ...

I really need to stop getting off on tangents in my blog posts.  I had a ton of fun this weekend and it looks like everyone else did too.  

=============================

"Hi dc - This will take one second.
You recently began looking for jobs on AngelList.
How likely are you to recommend AngelList to other people looking for a new job?"

It really depends on whether this person seems like they want a job in an Startup.  If so, AngelList is *the best place* to find out about new opportunities with small to medium size startups, those with 10 to 50 employees.  

I'll describe a little bit more about how I've used AngelList in my job search.  However, I'm really writing this for myself.  I save snippets of text I write on the internet and I might edit it or add some of it to my blog.

One major feature that would make a job search a little easier on AngelList would be curated lists of companies that are hiring.  This would make it easier for me to sift through everything to find the right positions and companies for me.  Curated lists of hiring startups are probably already implemented on AL to some degree.

One more thing I can think of is that there are a lot of companies who just want to keep job postings active on their profile.  This is because they know that prospective employees searching through AngelList are probably higher quality than average.  However, there are companies I know who are not actively hiring for these positions, but if the right person came along they'd hire them.  I'm not really sure how you'd address this problem or whether it's really a problem at all.

One minor gripe I have -- and it's a good problem to have =] --there are so many startups on AngelList that it makes it difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Not really a problem with AL.  It's just that there are many new startups across the country and many of their markets/products/brands/purposes overlap.  That is, there are so many companies trying to do similar things that in order to identify those who are unique or those who are likely to be successful is very difficult.  And while it sounds bad saying it, getting a job with a startup that is ultimately going to struggle after a year is not where I want to be.  And I don't mind playing for the losing team, if I felt like I was working on something revolutionary with little chance of success.

So, for me, searching for jobs on AL -- and searching for jobs in general -- so far has been fairly difficult, since it takes so much time to identify a company that I feel comfortable with.  And maybe I'm not using the features in the most effective way.  

The last time I searched for jobs on AngelList, I spent a few hours briefly surfing through hiring companies.  I narrowed down the cities to those I want to work in, which is mainly NYC, SF, Denver & Tokyo.  If the company is not remote or in one of those cities, I'm not looking for it and this is because I want to move to an area with a great tech community.  

So first, I searched through companies on the startups page instead of looking at the jobs because I'm not just looking for a job, I'm looking for a company to commit myself to.  So here, I can identify small startups to which I feel like I can contribute by being creative, as well as landing a position with some of the best stock options by being one of the first 50 employees.

But then, I found that I couldn't narrow down the companies on the Startups page by location, so I searched each location that I'm interested in.  

Basically, I ended up building a list of 30 or 40 companies that caught my eye, which is promising for spending an hour or two.  They seemed unique, possibly revolutionary, would offer good work experience or would be great work environments.  Then, I needed to go through each company to make sure it seems like a great opportunity.  I have a list of things I review for each company and usually, less than 1% of companies meet this criteria, but each company takes at least an hour to research.  

This criteria includes the following
- Are their goals and practices in line with my values
- Is their business model ethical?  Is it viable?
- What other great things have the founders and early employees accomplished?
- For startups: how is their product unique?  Does it change the game?
- How many employees work here? What are the most vital roles going to be in this business?
- How can I play a part in this business?  Am I going to be a low level programmer with no input to the product?  Or am I going to be a high level early-stage CIO who has to do everything at blazing speeds? I may be cut out for some CIO positions, but not without being able to delegate most of the work.
- How am I going to grow here?  Is this business one where'd I'd like to stay for at least a year?  If not, move on.  It's not worth it for either party.  
- Or is this the kind of business where you'd want to stay for three or four years?
- And most important, is working for this business worth mostly giving up on all my startup ideas for one to three years?  If I'm going to commit to something, I'm going to commit to it.

Typically, on any job search, I'll usually sort jobs by most recent because I want to identify the companies who are actively searching and those opportunities where I can be one of the first applicants.  I feel like there are some sorting options I used last time that I can't find anymore

Also, it's important to note that I'm not an investor and while that's appealing to me, I don't have the chips to play, so I haven't used those features.  Additionally, I don't yet have a startup or product at the point where I feel it's appropriate to market it on AngelList.  

This is because, in my projects thus far, I'm usually the only person: I have to think of branding, marketing, business strategy, business model, etc.  All that **and** I have to be the sole developer -- and I'm not exactly the fastest programmer, especially when I'm constantly distracted by other roles.  Basically, if I don't yet have an MVP and I'm stuck in Roanoke, VA with little to no networking opportunities, then it might not be wise to start marketing my ideas on AngelList.  I already know what answer I'd get from investors -- show me what you've built -- that is, if I got any answer at all with nothing built.

I realize this is more than you asked for.  However, it should give you an idea of how I've used AngelList, what I'm looking for in your product and why I think it's great for finding positions at startups.

Workplace bullying 
========================

obviously, not everything i've listed has happened TO me.
- but most everything listed IS possible or useful to a manipulator in some way.
- it's also VERY VERY important that I state not all of this is career related.  this results from my life experience.
- however, i have A LOT of experience with A LOT of VERY DIFFERENT people.  people from all over the US, in all different social classes.
- difference by income distribution: mega rich people are often conniving. poor people have a robin hood complex.
- but it's not fair to make this judgement. it doesn't matter what demographic, it contains manipulative people.
- parents, family or friends are manipulative.
- much of this behavior i describe is exhibited by drug dealers and organized crime.

it is important to note that most people 
- do not behave this way and are genuinely interested in others' best interests
- do not have the experience or the social model to manipulate people without burning themselves

normalizing sociopathic behavior:
- game of thrones, blacklist, etc, etc
- mainstream media is normalizing this behavior and it's terrible!!

modeling social behavior
- applying category theory
- everyone has their own model of how social behavior works.  some are accurate, some are terrible.

what type of person would exhibit this behavior
- afraid of losing their job.
- seeking promotion or job security? weed out threats early and set yourself up for success
- just a fucking mean ass person
- (not trying to be ageist) but i have noticed that older people have more experience and a better social model, so when they exhibit this behavior, it's worse.  (30+)

levels of self-awareness in sociopathic behavior
- responsive - only happens when the person is in a bad mood.  no overall strategy
- premeditated - person seems to have every angle and condition thought out.  usually, this person is very good at chess.  but still, only thinks out certain subjects.
- pervasive - this person always seeks to line things up, so he can use them later.  always thinking ahead, just in case.

examples of behavior i experienced
- in relationships
- in jamskating
  - room at summerjam. unlockable.  room specifically reserved by organizers of summerjam
  - certificate errors immediately upon connection to hotel network at summerjam
  - certificate errors and slow connections to specific sites (GMAIL) at other hotels for skating events
  - suspected hacking back in 2005 due to the circulation of undisclosed information
  - one of my teammates was told that he would be doing NBA and College Basketballs
    - and all he had to do was be the thorn in my side and tear everything apart.
- in the workplace
- in the software industry
- in the entertainment industry
- in general life
  - malware loaded to randomly open porn tabs while you're browsing in a coffee shop
heir computer, so you can keep tabs on them.  this was heinously easy to do 10 years ago.

tactics for managers:
- unfairly distribute work.  make sure high effort, low reward, low visibility tasks are assigned to this person.
- assign work to this person, with their weaknesses in mind.  or pick a toolset for a project that includes mostly things they don't have experience with.
- "death by micromanagement" prohibit usage of specific tools require to complete the tasks you've assigned them. 
- this is a double whammy, because usually you can ensure someone fails.  and they might even outright disobey your orders.  

### Leave Politics at Home! For your own sake!!

I've never been one to push my beliefs on others, but I've also never hidden my political beliefs online.  I'm concerned that if American society keeps marching down the path of **totalitarianism**, then ultimately, this kind of sociopathic behavior is going to become institutionalized.  That is, if it's not already.  

What do I mean?  That a certain political faction -- either right or left, it really doesn't matter -- will gain power and utilize politics and divisive tactics to wedge moderates and opposition supporters out from income-earning positions.  **Especially** those who make political donations!

> You might call it [RINO](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/23/rino-hunting-season-opens-in-earnest-with-end-of-shutdown-drama.html) [hunting](http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/12/18/rino-hunting-policy-and-history-are-against-jeb-bush-n1933627).  
The thing about extremist politics is that it evokes extremist tactics.  You're going to find Occupiers and Tea Partiers who try to unfairly push out the opposing sad.  It's sickening and I hope it doesn't come to this, but if previous revolutions show you anything, this is what happens when radicals gain power!

I'm not kidding by the way. I have had this happen to me. Politics is divisive. If someone identifies your politics, they may not harbor ill-will towards your politics, specifically. But certain people will recognize this as a tool with which to isolate you at work, by identifying other people on the opposite side and then playing you against each other.

Part 3: passive aggressive behavior specific to software development

it seems that, in particular, software is ripe for passive aggressive behavior that wastes time.  this is because passive aggressive behavior involves a lot of math.  it involves functionally defining how you want to alter behavior to maximize a particular aspect of that behavior.

- getting stuck in "pull request land"
- dividing stories into the smallest chunks possible
- goal is to increase overhead for one person

===============

Just finished ‪#‎PartOne‬ on a series of articles on ‪#‎Bullying‬ in the workplace. Through this series, I will describe how ‪#‎PassiveAggressive‬ behavior is toxic to relationships in the workplace and why ‪#‎Sociopathic‬ behavior is rampant in America.

The reason why I'm posting this here is because in 2005, I was caught blindsided by these kinds of tactics in ‪#‎Jamskating‬. I had never experienced anything like it in my life up to that point. And I was introduced to this book 48 Laws of Power through people in Jamskating. 

=============== Wireless Battery Powered Headphones

One aspect of wireless battery-powered headphones is that [i think...] you don't need a headphone amp to enjoy the full sound -- since it would be stupid for the manufacturers to not have the battery to output the proper amperage! And this seems to be the case, since my Beats sound completely different than other headphones i've worn. They seem to be missing crisp mid-upper range though.

Although the sound is digital, the convenience is overwhelming. If you're complaining about digital audio and you're not using these in studio GTFO honestly. lulz.

I've got the Wireless Studio Beats and I enjoy them, though the specs on beats aren't as great as Sennheisers for the same price. I got in a lil argument with some friends about this on facebook though. They claimed that Sennheiser Open Ear Momentums weren't that great because they are closed ear & not open ear ... WTF? I've never heard that. 

All I know is that I've looked up the detailed stats for Momentums and nearly every other headphone from the $300 to $700 range and NOTHING COMPARED! The 30hz & 300hz square wave reproduction is just about as good as you can get for $400! Other stats are great, too.

And my friends were busting on the Beats. I actually enjoy my Beats, though I realize they're not the best. But I purchased the black on black color, so that it's harder to recognize that I'm wearing beats, lulz. Oh and some of these guys are Full Sail students & grads. So of course, I'm the fucking idiot. LULZ again.

=============== Ancient forms of math

some guy in the 16th century supposedly invented logarithms? come on, ancient people weren't stupid. they had to know how to permute a function's arguments to arrive at the logarithm. we assume most math was invented in europe in the 16th-18th centuries and that's dumb. for example, indians in the 14th century were doing stuff with derivatives, infinite series and possibly stuff paralelling the Runge-Kutta method. there's no way you can do that math and not know what a !@$#'ing logarithm is.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%...

IMO, ancient greeks were far more advanced in math than we give them credit for. however, they probably didn't do much with algebra, calculus, etc because that's computationally expensive and not useful to ancient people, as it's mostly applicable in science. however, there are forms of math these ancient peoples would have to have known about. i need to do more research and reading on the subject to develop a more informed opinion.
