#### Examine/Contrast incentivation/influence/values/ethics in democracy and communism

This article (or series ... bleh!) will first examine and contrast how
influence, power, etc are managed in both democracy (w/ capitalism)
and communism (or socialism w/ authoritarian economics).
- Then, I'll discuss how individuals can "create" influence
  themselves. Similarly, I'll discuss how families, small groups and
  communities can work together to do the same

#### creation/diffusion of influence in society (from the bottom up)

After comparing those mechanisms for the "creation" and diffusion of
influence in society, I'll detail how individuals in most every
society can empower themselves by strengthening those influence
creation mechanisms => *particularly, education!*

#### Our Revolution of Empowerment

We need a revolution, not just in America, but across the world.
However, revolutions can be violent or involve large transfers of
assets. We don't need that.

- what I'm imagining is a revolution of empowerment
  - so that, starting with the individual, we can transform the world
    from the ground up.
  - this builds on the ideas in this series: creation/diffusion of
    influence in a society
    - but instead of going with democracy or communism
      - either essentially means leaning more heavily towards one
        currency for change: either money($$$) or affluence in social
        institutions)
      - obviously, we gotta pick one or the other. different systems
        work for different areas. For america, we need democracy and
        capitalism. **American needs democracy because of the general
        protections on an individual's rights**: *speech, religion,
        property, life, liberty, ... pursuit of happiness and
        whatnot!*
  - so, what are our options?


### Influence Flow on the Micro Scale

- how else does influence flow in the micro scale?
  - what do we use it one? we need things (favors, jobs, etc) from
    each other on a small scale.
    - this can be explained in a kind of anarcho-capitalist way
  - typically anyone who's building their life upwards is gaining
      influence and power over their circumstances
    - but there are people who squander their money/etc through poor
      decisions or destructive lifestyles
    - and those who lose their money/influence because of conditions
      outside of their control

### Why are so many people encumbered with problems outside of their control?

- the question then becomes: why do so many people end up living in
  situations which are outside of their control or which they believe
  are outside of their control? *and then: how do we minimize these
  things?*
  - what is it that burdens us with problems that require expenditure
    or time or some other form of influence?
  - and how can we minimize such things at a micro-scale, so that it
    makes a difference on a larger scale

### Applying some of these ideas towards poverty

- and particularly I'm talking about poverty: how can we focus on
  cleaning up the kinds of problems which keep people encumbered with
  poverty?
  - our most valuable tool here is education.
    - how do we get people to embrace educational opportunities? how
      do we prevent gradual aversion of populace to education during
      our approach towards the singularity?
    - advances in education, coupled with changes to society, are the
      primary reason i'm excited abou this
  - one major tool (which intertwines with education)
    - cognitive development via the arts.
      - (expand on cognitive/metacognitive devlepment)
  - other tools include:
    - social engineering
      - institutions, subcultures, common practices, and (?) to focus
        on building sociological/psychological elements that push
        towards a common goals of:
        - interdependence
        - opportunity
        - influence creation/diffusion for society on the micro scale:
          individual/family/local/community
          - there are many initiatives for doing a lot of this
      - (e.g. app idea) identify citizens on social media or IRL who are
        isolated and find out why!
    - hmmm... others?

(after completing the main thoughts here, summary above should be a
bit more brief)

## A Revolution of Empowerment for the 21st Century

Start with a brief discussion of Democracy vs Communism
- particularly the values/ethics systems of both

- in a communist or democratic society, what motivates people to work
  hard?
  - in a communist system
    - it's cultural. it's social engineering that creates these
      values/ethics structures?
  - in a democratic & capitalist system
    - it's
- as currency and wealth are really medium of exchange for what
  conveys a liquidity of influence,
  - (need to move the content in this section around. cover basics
    first, then lead into a new section to distinguish between more
    specific examples of moving wealth around)
  - then ultimately the question comes down to how does each system of
    governance structure it's mechanisms for diffusion of influence
    - basically, how does one acquire or dispense or accumulate
      influence
      - this ends up being very different in each kind of system
      - easier to accumulate influence in capitalist societies because
        you can accumulate physical wealth converring influence
        - in communist command economies, it's difficult for one to
          accumulate wealth because taxes are very high,
          - private savings rates would usually be low (i think?)
            - expenses are usually on par with that of someone's wages
      - diffusion of influence is more tightly constrained in
        communist or socialist societies
        - this is restricted by rigid hierachies and party dominance
        - communication can be more heavily restricted. it's the norm
          instead of the exception, especially higher up the hierarchy
        - therefore it's more difficult for private individuals to
          confer influence
      - if influence exchanges (via wealth, role, or otherwise) could
        be mapped out in a graph for democratic and communist systems
        - for both is the nodes in the graph would be defined by the
            hierarchical organizations of business, government, party
            and family/social institutions
        - the ways in which influence is exchanged in communist
          countries more closely aligns with the hierarchical
          structures of nodes.
          - influence is more likely to be exchanged with local nodes
            in the hierarchy
          - there would less edges connecting nodes across hierarchies
            for organizations and especially moving upwards in
            society.
            - this should mean it can be a bit harder for someone to
              work their way up in a country like this.
              - obviously one of the main ideas of communism is to
                empower the poor and the hardest working..
                - *but i'd love to talk with someone who's studied this
                  precise topic in political theory: how easy is it to
                  move upwards in society and how does that differ in
                  implementations of these two systems*
        - in democratic countries, because people are more free to
          design their own hierarchical structures, intermix b/w
          them, communicate freely, etc
          - then upward motion in society here is very much dependent on
            starting conditions, especially with regard to education
            and wealth
            - but again, this system also has mechanisms in place to
              ensure that we have opportunities for all
          - the graph here would edges allowing influence to diffuse
            more freely across society,
            - however, because some groups accumulate significantly
              more wealth than others, this allows people to exert
              more control on the system as a whole
              - but IMO property rights are crucial. if your system
                doesn't protect property rights, it's not for me. it
                might work in other places....
- hierarchical structures & specialzation role (wtf??)
  - ughhh this was a more complete idea....
- anyways, the structures by which a society enables/controls the
  diffusion of influence lay the foundation for incentivization in
  society
  - this idea breaks down a bit in the face of a generally demoralized
    society that doesn't identify opportunities or completely lacks
    true opportunity for self-empowerment
  - these mechanisms of incentivizations include:
    - desire for a specific role
    - desire for power in hierarchy or local power/influence
    - desire to accumulate wealth
    - religion
    - education & culture
    - assets (both systems transfer influence via assets)
    - patriotism
      - this includes goals and dreams like those sold to us in
        advertising and via culture
- even though communism often lacks true property rights and thus,
  it can be hard to truly own something and control it completely or
  sell it
  - further, if you are permitted to sell real-estate/etc assets on
    their more controlled market, then, since the gov't controls
    exchange of most assets on the market, they really have the
    advantage to determine market behavior.
    - also, with much lower savings rates, it becomes harder to find
      buyers for large assets. again, fewer merchants on the market
      means market favors the government every time, or any group
      exchanging with significant investment in those assets
  - regardless of whether you have true property rights and the
    ability to sell in a disadvantageous market,
    - someone still needs to control who uses those asset resources
      and how. individuals associated with owners or government
      institutions decide how people use property of the state (and
      property "owned" by individuals)
- but the point is, the main incentivization structures for communism
  and democracy basically just replace $$$ for affluence.
  - it's really one for another. both systems require the diffusion of
    influence through currency and social institutions.
    - communism and socialism with controlled economies depend more on
      leveraging institutions than cash
    - democracy with capitalsm depend more on wealth to act as a store
      of value, but really as a medium of exchange for influence
      - btw: VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLAR!! you can vote with a buck every
        day, do not empower those who you disagree with.
  - at the end of the day, we've exchanged diffusion of influence via
    $$$ for diffusion via hierarchical social institutions (kinda
    repeat of above)
    - the state often not only monopolizes the mechanism of influence
      diffusion, but also of influence "creation"
      - religions organizations are banned for this reason. they
        "create" influence through their own systems that acts as
        competition for other social institutions
      - media organizations are tightly controlled, in part for a
        similar reason: media has power over the information people
        engage with.
        - the media can therefore affect what people want, what they
          spend their time thinking about, their long term goals, what
          discussions the start around the water cooler at
          work... yotta yotta
- IMO, regardless of the system


- here's an idea though: why shouldn't that "creation" of influence
  originate at the individual/family/community levels first?
  - it already does in many ways. e.g. someone invests in a degree in
    a burgeoning field: boom, the individual has more influence.
  - but knowledge is power and education confers influence to
    individuals in society. therefore, if we can create social
    institutions which enable us to quickly more efficiently educate
    people, then we should



### Addressing Depopulation Conspiracy Theories

(Or... why this is really dumb, yet actually kind of a real thing)
- (hmmm i should just skip the discussion and get straight ot the
  point, removing most of this section)

- everyone knows there are contingency plans in place for marshall
  law, etc in America and every other country.
  - I'm sure you've heard about them in spooky youtube videos.
  - Not to completely discredit all of those videos, but most of them
    are bogus. the programs, however? they're real.
  - yet, they are well intentioned. only a criminally negligent
    government would lack a plan in case of a major, major disaster
    - the more resources they have to plan, the more complicated their
      disaster programs are.
    - yet, just because they exist doesn't mean that the government is
      plotting to use this stuff. they are ready; that is all.
- however, there are real conspiracies out there for depopulation
  involving viruses, war, etc. but most of this stuff is more about
  brainstorming potential disasters than planned massive depopulation.

forget the hypotheical conspiracy theories, which are often moreso
designed to keep you captivated and distracted. yes, that's right: I
just said conspiracy theories are conspiracy theories LMAO
- usually there's some truth to each of these. if there wasn't, they'd
  fall apart pretty quickly.


#### For Humanity's Survival in the 21st Century

Or better yet, to ensure we don't just survive, we thrive:
- what is better?
  - to have 1-5 billion people on earth in 2040 to attempt to
    terraform & correct for climate change?
    - this is the beta group
    - lower resource needs ... meh, maybe better chance for
      survival... maybe
  - or to have 8-12 billion people ready to tackle the same problems?
    - as well as whatever kinds of problems humanity will face around
      2040?

#### the beta's (1-5 billion people in 2040)

just think about it: how did these people get here?
- there must have been some massive depopulation event, right? Major
  war, systemic collapse of ecosystem followed by famine, epidemic,
  a technological disaster
  - whatever combination of events decimated half of the worlds
    population in 25 years
    - wouldn't you think that would be traumatic?
    - are the beta's
      - who experienced some combination of events so tragic, they
        create new architypes for worldwide culture (think Noah's
        flood)
      - are they going to be motivated to work hard to face whatever
        challenges ahead of it?
    - no, politics of fear and power emphacizing survival of self and
      opportunism will prevail!
      - a population that experiences something like this is not going
        to be adequately prepared and they may have a mess on their
        hands 100x worse than the world of 2020
- a disaster causing this much death will trigger widespread
  dispair. people will be difficult to motivate, especially in
  groups.
  - there might be a breakdown of established technological systems
    - think breakdown of FCC spectrum regulation
    - some of these things could be fucking terrible
  - in the face of a breakdown of:
    - social/regulatory norms,
    - supply chains,
    - trade,
    - stock/commodity/finance markets,
    - internet,
    - medical infrastructure,
    - technology controls
    - & food supply...
  - how do you think systems like these would fare in a world that
    *somehow* lost half its population in 25 years??....
    - not very well, right?
  - so, in the face widespread chaos and fear, where politics of
    power and opportunism are justified and ethics/values systems
    are forgotten...
    - then how could we possibly rebuild those systems listed above?
    - what kind of leaders is such a world likely to produce?

yeh, it might make for a good mad max sequel, but it's not what I want
my grandchildren to inherit (not that this is going to happen)
- why? because everyone at the top kinda knows: yes depopulation
  relieves stress from mother earth, but ... all in all: IT'D BE A
  FUCKING DISASTER!
  - it would leave 1-5 billion people a legacy of cultural trauma
    requiring a dozen generations to heal.

#### the alpha's (8-12 billion people in 2040)

So, for the survival of humanity, if there are 8-12 billion people,
then IMO that is 8-12 billion chances for impact!  And this is one of
the strongest forces motivating me to pursue a cultural revolution
that transforms our world's population today into a population which
is ready to face such struggles.

- it's because every one of those people alive is a chance for us to
  turn it around.
  - so if a revolution of empowerment sweeps across the globe,
    imagine the kind of combined impact humanity could have on the
    globe.
- Any day: I would prefer the alpha group!
  - 10+ billion invigorated and self-empowered individuals with some
    hard resource constraint problems.
  - over 1-5 billion scared victims of only God knows what, who are
    primarily motivated by fear and self-preservation.
    - the alpha group faced many of the same problems, but they
      prepared and compromised and sacrificed and worked together!!
  - btw, nanotech allows us to scalably expand to space, probably
    by 2030. there's your moonbase! lulz
