In societies with different governmental structures, what motivates
people to work hard? In communist societies and democratic,
free-market societies, how does this differ? This question is of
utmost importance. In a free-market, democratic system, it is a mix of
financial and sociocultural incentivization that pushes people to
acheive more, for themselves and for society.

In a communist system, the incentivization is primarily sociocultural,
acheived through social engineering, which exists to a lesser extent
which the Party creates values systems that are designed to push
people towards striving for some collective end. These systems created
by social engineering are far from perfect, vulnerable to subversion
and usually idealized by academics blinded by their own righteousness.
When all you have is a hammer, everthing looks like a nail. Social
engineers believe that through academic ideas, they have all the
answers, but are often blind to the truly limited scope of their
knowledge.

We need a revolution, not just in America, but across the world. There
isn't a better time for it than now. However, revolutions can be
violent or involve large transfers of assets. We don't need any of
that. War is expensive, in terms of human and financial capital. For
assets in our economy, both the subversive transition of control and
the forcible transfer of ownership take a toll on productivity and
economic resilience. They are morally wrong, and a major drain on the
economy at a time when we need America to be as competitive as
possible.

# [Our Revolution of Empowerment](#our-revolution-of-empowerment)

Imagine a revolution of empowerment. It starts with the individual, so
that we can transform the world from the ground up. This builds on the
ideas in this series: engineering the creation and diffusion of
influence in a society, but approaching this in a simple, common-sense
manner. With all the knowledge in the world, we delude ourselves into
forcing artificial changes, but when we grasp onto things tightly, we
always get it wrong and what we're left with isn't what we wanted at
all. Instead we should ensure that societal ills become more visible,
metrics are analyzed to ensure our tactics actually improve conditions
of poverty, and the solutions we implement naturally and actually
produce positive changes.

### [Why Wait For Someone To Get In Power When Change Emerges from the Individual?](#why-wait-for-someone-to-get-in-power-when-change-emerges-from-the-individual)

This doesn't start with waiting for someone to get in power. Our
revolution transcends identity and we can instead empower ourselves.
It doesn't start with the perfect ism or the perfect social
institutions operating with the perfect doctrine and the perfect set
of people. Instead, our movement assumes that nothing is or can become
perfect and entails constant self-realization, not just of the
individual, but of strata of society. It starts with the individual,
who once empowered and relieved of restraint, can transform the world
around themselves.

This self-realization requires education. Never in human history have
we had more tools at their fingertips for our collective
self-empowerment than we do now. Today, every person is empowered to
learn at minimal cost with minimal investment. Knowledge is power &
let's harness that. To manifest this and accelerate our
transformation, we'll need to utilize a bit of social engineering.

### [Social and Financial Connections Form Circuits Of Influence](#social-and-financial-connections-form-circuits-of-influence)

Power and the circuits by which influence is transferred in society
operate in completely different manners in various governmental
systems. These circuits are like channels over which social and
financial capital can flow. There are various types of channels and
types of influence, the accumulation of which is either social or
financial capital.

These circuits of influence can be wisely or poorly architected,
forming systems of incentivization and motivation for citizenry.
Hence, they can be designed as sociocultural underpinnings to evoke
specific virtues, ideals and behaviors within people. Within different
political and cultural environments, these channels are structured and
arranged to behave in various ways and can be blocked or unavailable,
resulting in less than desirable social mobility.

<a name="communism-restricts-social-mobility" />

### [Communism Restricts Social Mobility](#communism-restricts-social-mobility)

Communism minimizes wealth as a store of social influence by design.
To the detriment of America, most socialists and marxists do not
*truly* understand this or its consequences. They make a bargain to
improve their situation and harness demagoguery to get what they want
in the short-term. They do that without understanding how it cripples
evolutionary mechanisms for aspects of society, reducing the rate of
meaningful change and the degrees of freedom in society. It powers its
services with central banking that inevitably fails, while undermining
fundamental factors that lead to prosperity.

<a name="communism-is-less-equiped-to-incentivize-behavior" />

### [Communism is Less Equiped to Incentivize Behavior](#communism-is-less-equiped-to-incentivize-behavior)

Communism, lacking financial channels for incentivization is thus,
less equipped for motivating citizenry. Because its mechanics and
implementation force the supression of competing means of social
influence (i.e. suppression of religion) it yields a populus less
capable of fending for itself out of a void of intergenerational
experience. For communism, the lack of financially incentivized
behavior magnifies the already burdensom costs of expensive social
programs. It's full of wishful thinking: that people can be motivated
through patriotism and Party loyalty alone, especially when those
ideals are suspect and citizens understand they are swimming in a
toxic ideology which breeds sociopathic behavior and blindly chases
utilitarian, materialistic ideals.

### [Turn Inwards And Conquer Inner Space](#turn-inwards-and-conquer-inner-space)

Instead of adopting the ideals of some 'ism or blaming our problems on
something external, we will turn inwards for our revolution. We will
conquer inner space, starting from the individual, rather than to seek
solutions outside. We need to conquer the negativity in our hearts
that leads to problems in the world. Everything good and everything
evil arises from our hearts and minds. Emotions, thoughts, words,
actions, rigid beliefs. It comes from our hearts first.

If we survive the next 100 years, we'll survive for 10,000 years.
Humanity has enough problems given our current circumstances and
possibility of catastrophe in the near future. Why should we permit
conflict to burden us more?! If we need the best aspects of the human
condition to inspire us through this next century, should we continue
to sow the worst seeds of human behavior, fallible at best and
malevolent when unchecked?

<a name="contrasting-systems-of-incentivization-and-influence-dispersion" />

# [Contrasting Systems of Incentivization and Influence Dispersion](#contrasting-systems-of-incentivization-and-influence-dispersion)

A political ideology's framework or a society's platform for
incentivization should be paramount in any evaluation of that
collection of institutions capacity to serve the people. Its ability
to compel morality, strong character, beneficence and a resilient
culture are crucial metrics in deciding whether change is needed. The
framework or platform must serve the people in the short term and the
long term. If it doesn't compel and incentivize beneficent development
of the people as strong, vigilant and capable of handling any
situation, it leaves them vulnerable in the long term.

<a name="the-micro-and-macro-of-influence-dispersion" />

### [The Micro and Macro of Influence Dispersion](#the-micro-and-macro-of-influence-dispersion)

How individuals can generate influence?

- How can families, small groups and communities can connect to
  benefit from the same.

After comparing those mechanisms for the "creation" and diffusion of
influence in society, I'll

- detail how individuals in most every
society can empower themselves by strengthening those influence
creation mechanisms => *particularly, education!*

- how else does influence flow in the micro scale?
  - what do we use it one? we need things (favors, jobs, etc) from
    each other on a small scale.
    - this can be explained in a kind of anarcho-capitalist way
    - voting with your dollar
  - typically anyone who's building their life upwards is gaining
      influence and power over their circumstances
    - but there are people who squander their money/etc through poor
      decisions or destructive lifestyles
    - and those who lose their money/influence because of conditions
      outside of their control

People can influence others in many ways: via direct communication,
media, creation of ideas, commerce, law, etc. However, the capacity
for these transactions of influence to take place emerges from the
structure of the social graph. The more connected people are the more
advantaged in this situation. So the size of an individual's 2&#x00B0;
and 3&#x00B0; neighborhoods in the social graph, their capacity to
leverage that set of nodes and those nodes' level of influence
themselves form the basis of valuable metrics of social and financial
affluence. If we measure this today, we will find that there are many
people like myself who are socially and financially disempowered. This
is intentionally so and methodically achieved.

<a name="the-financial-graph-inherits-the-form-of-the-social-graph" />

### [The Financial Graph Inherits the Form of the Social Graph](#the-financial-graph-inherits-the-form-of-the-social-graph)

To understand how social and financial influence spreads through a
society, we'll need to be familiar with the structure of the graph
over which people form connections. The financial graph emerges from
the social graph, but also compels form to emerge in the social
graph. There is dualistic interplay determining the base structure in
both the social and financial graphs. This cyclic interplay resulting
in emergent form weaves additional channels for influence dispersion
from sources of financial capital into social capital and vice versa,
which better serves people who have little of either than a
party-defined, purely social graph. So, the benefits of free market
capitalism include variation in the structure of the social graph that
thus encourages dispersion of capital over channels that wouldn't
exist in a command driven, communist economy.

That's one reason communism is its own antithesis: it is an ideology
that mathematically leaves people less equipped for upwards mobility
in society. Also, both communism's social and financial graph
structures converge towards party ideals. Because the social graph
itself is dependent on party ideals, this leaves the people less
socially free in addition to being economically restricted by low
savings rates and unpredictable macroeconomic conditions.

### [In the Free Market, Entities Coalesce Around Efficient And Value-Creating Solutions](#in-the-free-market-entities-coalesce-around-efficient-and-value-creating-solutions)

In democracy and free market systems, social networks are free to form
around issues in society, and end up more pragmattically shaped around
the solutions to them. This general phenomenon, the tendancy of the
social graph to be formed in line with ideals varies along a continuum
stretches from democracy, socialism, communism and authoritariansm. In
authoritarian and communist systems, the social graph mirrors some
ideals that are forced on people. Socialism requires less government
mediated structure and graph influence than communism, but more than
free-market systems. Once the social graph and especially the
financial graph incur significant changes, this is incredibly hard to
undo.

The other side to this continuum along the level of the government
influence in and on the social graph, the extremes of which would
include anarchism. However, almost any government interference affects
the quality of economic/financial signal coming from
markets. Additional influence on the social graph and its behavior
will further tend to mask true trends in price, value and
demand. Particularly interesting is the effect of belief of
participants in shifting the social fabric.

<a name="trends-that-strongly-mutate-the-social-graph-can-last-for-generations" />

### [Trends That Strongly Mutate the Social Graph Can Last For Generations](#trends-that-strongly-mutate-the-social-graph-can-last-for-generations)

During traditional revolution, because of transfer of assets,
disruption and coercive dynamics, the flow, channels and gradient of
influence become disrupted. This confluence always trends against the
status quo. Once new structures congeal in the social and financial
graphs, they become difficult to reset without unprecendented dynamics
and nearly impossible to restore. The Party that seizes power will
surreptitiously employ tactics to disempower opponents and stifle
reactionary sentiment. They always do so before achieving nominal
power because the seeds of such political transformations require
generations.

That's not to say that free market capitalism is perfect,
but social metrics should give us better insight on how to make the
economy work for the common person again. To start, we can use data
science to optimize people's accessibility to interacitons with nodes
on the social graph.

<a name="the-sociocultural-implementation-of-mathematical-optimization" />

### [The Sociocultural Implementation of Mathematical Optimization](#the-sociocultural-implementation-of-mathematical-optimization)

Free-market capitalist practices are basically the sociocultural
implementation of mathematical optimization of price, value,
geographic dispersion of resources and other factors. Free market
economics provide more efficient groupings of resources and people
that enables more accurate optimization, a result of competition.
Machine learning algorithms are essentially competition between
various groupings of analytical solutions to a problem. Each economic
entity's product is like it's version of a solution for demand which
competes against other products and processes to optimize price.

These capitalist practices can be abused, which also disrupts the
capacity of the social graph for dispersion of wealth and
influence. However, they are useful as a natural tool for optimizing
the economics of a small or large region because they will always
yield better information than the politburo. Both the politburo and
the free market have the capacity to be abused, but eliminating the
use of the market in pricing goods results in economic harm. More
power finds itself in the hands of fewer people.

<a name="the-graphs-of-command-economies-are-inherently-more-vulnerable" />

### [The Graphs of Command Economies Are Inherently More Vulnerable](#the-graphs-of-command-economies-are-inherently-more-vulnerable)

Aspects of command economies make them inherently supsect,
economically. The graph structure is less robust and less tested
against real economic problems. This later aspect is further
exacerbated since command economies depend on external stimulation to
succeed and the global market is [mostly] a free market. Thus, it
cannot be so predicted. The tightly structured economic graph with
fewer nodes mitigites meaningful signal from the economy and its own
markets are thus inherently less capable of pricing goods
accurately. Metrics for anticipation of global economic trends are
themselves less robust and so are a vulnerability in the case of
economic warfare. Because of their susceptibility to global economics
and because their internal economics are not-optimally valued, then
pure command economies and restricted or poorly structured markets
fail.

Today in the age of economic and information warfare, the economic
aspects of policy and governance are paramount. Information warfare
tactics are great counters to economic warfare, because they disrupt
belief, prices and expectations.

<a name="free-market-systems-are-lean-with-flexible-evolutionary-dynamics" />

### [Free Market Systems Are Lean With Flexible Evolutionary Dynamics](#free-market-systems-are-lean-with-flexible-evolutionary-dynamics)

Because the graphs of free-market systems have forms dependent on
pragmatism and are motivated by winning through market competion, this
augments your system's ability to quickly adapt to shifts, both
microeconomic and macroeconomic. This is because entities acting
across the financial graph are free to reshape them as necessity and
trends dictate. They are not limited in form by tight coupling to
ideology. Therefore, businesses, consumers and etc are free to reshape
themselves as they need, resulting in type-speciation of roles and
behaviors in each businesses and consumers. This type-speciation is
what tends towards quick and dynamic evolution to capture global
economic demand early.

<a name="when-hyper-connected-the-metaphysical-becomes-increasingly-relevant" />

### [When Hyper-Connected, the Metaphysical Becomes Increasingly Relevant](#when-hyper-connected-the-metaphysical-becomes-increasingly-relevant)

Technology and hyper-connectedness trend towards accelerating
manisfestation of the metaphysical in the physical world. Therefore,
our world is more likely to become shaped by beliefs, belief systems
and epimemetic systems faster because of its hyperconnected nature and
the exponential rates of information transfer, accumulation and
dispersion.

<a name="inherently-predispositioned-to-developing-weak-economic-fundamentals" />

### [Inherently Predispositioned to Developing Weak Economic Fundamenals](#inherently-predispositioned-to-developing-weak-economic-fundamentals)

Socialism and particularly communism lead to dramatic shifts in the
social and financial graphs that undermine the fundamentals of
prosperity. This flaw to shift towards a fundamentally weaker system
is inherent in the ideology. Therefore, those who adapt to this are
hurting American economic interests at the most critical time of
innovation in history. These weaker system also accumulates wasted
economic output over time. Many of this ideas are difficult to
understand or completely missed without a perspective augmented by
graph theory.

<a name="liquidity-and-flux-of-influence-in-society" />

# [Liquidity and Flux of Influence In Societies](#liquidity-and-flux-of-influence-in-societies)

The financial equivalents of social influence, currency and wealth are
really a medium of exchange for what conveys liquidity of influence.
And so, ultimately, the question comes down to how does each system of
governance and each society structure its mechanisms for diffusion of
influence, both social and finacial, and how do those systems of
influence dispersion interact?

### [Influence Behaves Very Differently In Various Societies](#influence-behaves-very-differently-in-various-societies)

For a particular society or type of government, how does one acquire,
dispense, or accumulate influence? This ends up being very different
in each kind of system, but it's easier to accumulate influence in
capitalist societies because you can accumulate physical wealth
conferring a store of generalized influence.

<a name="low-savings-rates-strongly-constrain-diffusion-of-influence-to-the-people" />

### [Low Savings Rates Strongly Constrain Diffusion of Influence to the People](low-savings-rates-strongly-constrain-diffusion-of-influence-to-the-people)

In communist command economies, it's difficult for one to accumulate
wealth because taxes are very high, tending towards very low private
savings rates. Expenses are then a higher proportion of the average
person's wages than in capitalist systems that preserve the middle
class. If wealth drives influence in capitalist systems, then
restriction of wealth to a small segment of communist society means
that region's citizens likely have less influence over their
circumstances. This leads... (to wot?)

<a name="the-use-of-social-engineering-in-command-economies-constrains-influence-to-ideals" />

### [The Use of Social Engineering in Command Economies Constraints Influence to Ideals](#the-use-of-social-engineering-in-command-economies-constrains-influence-to-ideals)

Diffusion of influence is more tightly constrained in communist or
socialist societies by design. This is required for social engineering
to affect behavior. The people can only influence their local
cirumstances through social means and because influence diffusion is
restricted to rigid hierachies, the people's only means of
accumulating power is itself also more restricted. Further, under
party dominance, communication over any channel is more heavily
restricted. It's the norm instead of the exception, especially higher
up the hierarchy where people are entrusted with power. If you don't
conform, then the system strongly prefers you to be disempowered, if
not for the system's self-preservation then at least for advancement
of its goals.

<a name="constraints-to-influence-diffusion-are-further-constrained-by-groupthink" />

### [Constraints to Influence Diffusion are Further Contrained by Groupthink](#constraints-to-influence-diffusion-are-further-constrained-by-groupthink)

These factors increase societal friction and reduce social mobility
for private individuals to confer influence. By design, this tight
constraint on influence diffusion keeps people in line, magnified by
the groupthink results from tightly controlled social hierarchies. The
groupthink and us-versus-everyone-else mentality tends towards pushing
out minority opinions and ethnic groups, instead of including them.
They are instead used as a tool to further the agenda of the movement,
but because communism always results in strong, central authority,
social and ethnic minority groups suffer in the end.

- if influence exchanges (via wealth, role, or otherwise) could
  be mapped out in a graph for democratic and communist systems
  - for both, are the nodes in the graph would be defined by the
    hierarchical organizations of business, government, party and
    family/social institutions
    - the ways in which influence is exchanged in communist countries
      more closely aligns with the hierarchical structures of nodes in
      the social graph.
      - influence is more likely to be exchanged with local nodes
        in the hierarchy
        - there would less edges connecting nodes across hierarchies
          for organizations and especially moving upwards in society.
      - this means it's harder for someone to work their way up in a
          country like this.
        - obviously one of the main ideas of communism is to
          empower the poor and the hardest working..
        - *but i'd love to talk with someone who's studied this
          precise topic in political theory: how easy is it to
          move upwards in society and how does that differ in
          implementations of these two systems*

- in democratic countries, because people are more free to design
  their own hierarchical structures, intermix b/w them, communicate
  freely, etc
  - then upward motion in society here is very much dependent on
    starting conditions, especially with regard to education and
    wealth
    - but again, this system also has mechanisms in place to
      ensure that we have opportunities for all
      - or it should, at least
      - the graph here would edges allowing influence to diffuse
        more freely across society,
        - however, because some groups accumulate significantly
          more wealth than others, this allows people to exert
          more control on the system as a whole
          - but IMO property rights are crucial. if your system
            doesn't protect property rights, it's not for me. it
            might work in other places....
            - i want to be motivated by what i can attain and i
              want others to have the same. however, i'm motivated
              by what i can attain to use for others' benefit.
              that is, ultimately. as of now, i don't have
              resources

- local/global phase transitions and eigenstates in a social or
  financial graph.
  - this results in hyperdymensional emergent phenomena
    - including social ills and mental illness

- hierarchical structures & specialzation role (wtf??)
  - ughhh this was a more complete idea....

- anyways, the structures by which a society enables/controls the
  diffusion of influence lay the foundation for incentivization in
  society
  - this idea breaks down a bit in the face of a generally demoralized
    society that doesn't identify opportunities or completely lacks
    true opportunity for self-empowerment
  - these mechanisms of incentivizations include:
    - desire for a specific role
    - desire for power in hierarchy or local power/influence
    - desire to accumulate wealth
    - religion
    - education & culture
    - assets (both systems transfer influence via assets)
    - patriotism
      - this includes goals and dreams like those sold to us in
        advertising and via culture


### (Property Rights)

- communism often lacks true property rights and thus, it can be hard
  to truly own something and control it completely or sell it
  - further, if you are permitted to sell real-estate and other assets
    on their more controlled market, then, since the gov't controls
    exchange of most assets on the market, they really have the
    advantage to determine market behavior.
    - also, with much lower savings rates, it becomes harder to find
      buyers for large assets. again, fewer merchants on the market
      means a market favors the government every time, or any group
      exchanging with significant investment in those assets

  - regardless of whether you have true property rights and the
    ability to sell in a disadvantageous market,
    - someone still needs to control who uses those asset resources
      and how. individuals associated with owners or government
      institutions decide how people use property of the state (and
      property "owned" by individuals)

- but the point is, the main incentivization structures for communism
  and democracy basically just exchanges $$$ for affluence with
  government institutions.
  - it's really one for another. both systems require the diffusion of
    influence through currency and social institutions.
    - communism and socialism with controlled economies depend more on
      leveraging institutions than cash
    - democracy with capitalsm depend more on wealth to act as a store
      of value, but really as a medium of exchange for influence
      - btw: VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLAR!! you can vote with a buck every
        day. do not empower those who you strongly disagree with.
        - this is the strongest means we have for changing behaviors
          and preventing actions we don't agree with.
        - you can't really "vote with your dollar" in a communist
          system. this yet another reason its citizens are left *more
          disempowered* than in free market systems

  - at the end of the day, we've exchanged diffusion of influence via
    $$$ for diffusion via hierarchical social institutions (kinda
    repeat of above)
    - the state often not only monopolizes the mechanism of influence
      diffusion, but also of influence "creation"
      - religions organizations are banned for this reason. they
        "create" influence through their own systems that acts as
        competition for other social institutions
      - media organizations are tightly controlled, in part for a
        similar reason: media has power over the information people
        engage with.
        - the media can therefore affect what people want, what they
          spend their time thinking about, their long term goals, what
          discussions the start around the water cooler at
          work... yotta yotta

- IMO, regardless of the system

- here's an idea though: why shouldn't that "creation" of influence
  originate at the individual/family/community levels first?
  - it already does in many ways. e.g. someone invests in a degree in
    a burgeoning field: boom, the individual has more influence.
  - but knowledge is power and education confers influence to
    individuals in society. therefore, if we can create social
    institutions which enable us to quickly more efficiently educate
    people, then we should

- and if influence emerges from the bottom up, then it's advantageous
  to leverage and exclusivize influence over subgroups of people.
  - we all have people who influence us. Those who are subject to
    larger, more dispersed networks are subject to more
    influences. There is disparity in the level of influence from
    specific nodes to subgroups and individuals.

- transition into discussing why this implies our main struggle is

### [A Philosophical Battle](#a-philosophical-battle)

The major battle facing humanity today is philosophical. It may seem
technological, but it's not. It may seem the most urgent battle is
with nature or for resources, but it's not! The most crucial battle we
face in this decade and the next is philosophical: we must conquer
ourselves. We have to be intimately familiar with understand how
forces we can't imagine will change our lives. Known unknowns, unknown
knowns, and most importantly unknown unknowns. Humanity's
metamorphosis here won't be efficient, so how can we prepare the
cultures of 2030 to count on the fluid nature of information to stay
lean and stay agile? Again, this stands in stark contrast to the
typically slow pace of social engineering projects.

Throughout the ages, people have burdened by artificial limitations
imposed by their belief systems, which are crafted to unify the
actions of the masses to some end. Walls are imposed and blocks are
placed in front of people to compel them towards cooperation towards
goals, many of which were in place before these individuals were born.
In most cases, the individual is compelled to choose between
struggling for their own dreams or giving those up and contributing
towards some

[Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Work).

This is the struggle between pre-determinism and free will, reified
into life through esoteric orders who, perhaps selfishly, use
individuals' lives towards their own ends. To these people, you're a
pawn in someone else's game, just like everyone else.

![Adjustment Bureau]()

Unless their own dreams mesh with this pre-existing grand plan and they
receive the blessings of the people around them, then any effort

the rest of your life and then laugh at the way you squirm when you
don't understand why your life is a failure. They will orchestrate
this by interacting with you like a ship in a bottle and they will
never admit your strengths or victories and draw attention to your
failures and there is nothing you can do about it.

In the 21st century, this ends because of the tendancy towards
omnipresence of information. That is, belief systems themselves will
tend to decohere, then recongeal into a either a unified belief system
or a set of belief systems. This doesn't mean older belief systems
will fade away.

- in aggregate, these artificial walls and blocking mechanisms are
  incredibly harmful to people and to society.
  - more about this


### Why are so many people encumbered with problems outside of their control?

- the question then becomes: why do so many people end up living in
  situations which are outside of their control or which they believe
  are outside of their control? *and then: how do we minimize these
  things?*
  - what is it that burdens us with problems that require expenditure
    or time or some other form of influence?
  - and how can we minimize such things at a micro-scale, so that it
    makes a difference on a larger scale

### Applying some of these ideas towards poverty

- and particularly I'm talking about poverty: how can we focus on
  cleaning up the kinds of problems which keep people encumbered with
  poverty?
  - our most valuable tool here is education.
    - how do we get people to embrace educational opportunities? how
      do we prevent gradual aversion of populace to education during
      our approach towards the singularity?
    - advances in technology, coupled with changes to society, are the
      primary reason i'm excited about this
  - one major tool (which intertwines with education)
    - cognitive development via the arts.
      - (expand on cognitive/metacognitive devlepment)
  - other tools include:
    - social engineering
      - institutions, subcultures, common practices, and (?) to focus
        on building sociological/psychological elements that push
        towards a common goals of:
        - interdependence
        - opportunity
        - influence creation/diffusion for society on the micro scale:
          individual/family/local/community
          - there are many initiatives for doing a lot of this
      - (e.g. app idea) identify citizens on social media or IRL who are
        isolated and find out why!
    - hmmm... others?

(after completing the main thoughts here, summary above should be a
bit more brief)


<a name="a-cultural-revolution-and-a-cognitive-revolution" />

### [A Cultural Revolution *And* A Cognitive Revolution](#a-cultural-revolution-and-a-cognitive-revolution)

no... not that kind of cultural revolution

- expand on how education empowers individuals and how we can use
  technology to develop our minds.
  - We can transform our society through cognitive expansion.
  - [links to article on directive cognitive expansion]
- why does this help lift individuals out of poverty/etc?
  - from a philosophical standpoint, the body is simply a vehicle for
    the mind.
    - "equation" for life: spirit*(mind/body) ... i think that was it
      - to maximize their output from life, one must train the mind to
        harness their spirit, transcending the limitations imposed by
        their body. we all share physical limitations, btw (cut?)

###

*Ultimately, Bolsheviks were deceived into becoming serfs for another
master, **with fewer options for transcending societal limitations**.*
Most of the left that hasn't studied political science, economics or
philosophy doesn't truly understand the post-revolution mechanics of
influence in communist and far-left societies. The left claims the
implementations of marxist and socialist ideas will reprieve the
burdens of the poverty unto which they were cursed by birth.

There are various strata of leftists, which determines their beliefs
and course of actions. Some are well-educated and some are
unfortunately not. Still, socialism and communism appeals to those
suffering in poverty and looking for someone to help them out. Some on
the far left very clearly do understand what they are doing to America
and the world, as obseqious as their tactics might be.

A pure marxist implementation of communism doesn't allow for wealth as
a means of influence whatsoever. Interest rates are simply too high
because of the macroeconomic policies used for centrally-planned
economies, so savings can't be accumulated without tremendous
sacrifice. This is by design and anyone saving too much is targeted as
a threat or expected to adhere to the interests of the
Party. Otherwise, poverty experienced in the developed world can be
transcended through hard work, virtuous behavior, avoidance of
destructive behavior, accumulation of savings and education.

###

Communism robs people of the ability to use capital and savings for
social influence. Just ask anyone who couldn't escape a Soviet
satellite state. Many people end up in such poverty that they couldn't
leave if they wanted to: *you cannot save money*. That is not to say
that free-market democratic societies are perfect. However, if we make
a hard left, we *will* find ourselves in a hole that is much deeper
and much harder to climb out.  Communist and far-left nations target
dissenting citizens to cull threats early and monopolize social
influence by compelling anyone with power to be "connected" to the
Party.

The only way to raise yourself in society is through compliance with
the Party, which installs a cult of personality in lieu of
religion. Institutions then encourage clever hacks of social mechanics
as common cultural practices to effectively short-circuit any possible
resistence, identifying and sorting the most vocal/passitionate
support. By encouraging carniverous behavior, one disempowers
resistence, motivates through fear, filters influential positions for
loyalty and encourages logistic turnover in organizations, which
ensures no one has a foothold long enough to gain their bearing to
manifest as a threat to power. It's like musical chairs.

Why did Stalin push for world revolution? Because the economics of
communism are only sustainable via empire and that's what it is: serfs
changing one master for another. An advance through Poland and into
Europe was planned before WW2 because the architects of Soviet
communism needed to power the services Bolsheviks promised with
economic expansion. Stalin anticipated resistence from the traditional
European powers.

> trancendant enlightenment of former serfs

### (Addressing Depopulation Conspiracy Theories)

(Or... why this is really dumb, yet actually kind of a real thing)
- (hmmm i should just skip the discussion and get straight ot the
  point, removing most of this section)

- everyone knows there are contingency plans in place for marshall
  law, etc in America and every other country.
  - I'm sure you've heard about them in spooky youtube videos.
  - Not to completely discredit all of those videos, but most of them
    are bogus. the programs, however? they're real.
  - yet, they are well intentioned. only a criminally negligent
    government would lack a plan in case of a major, major disaster
    - the more resources they have to plan, the more complicated their
      disaster programs are.
    - yet, just because they exist doesn't mean that the government is
      plotting to use this stuff. they are ready; that is all.
- however, there are real conspiracies out there for depopulation
  involving viruses, war, etc. but most of this stuff is more about
  brainstorming potential disasters than planned massive depopulation.

forget the hypothetical conspiracy theories, which are often moreso
designed to keep you captivated and distracted. yes, that's right: I
just said conspiracy theories are conspiracy theories LMAO
- usually there's some truth to each of these. if there wasn't, they'd
  fall apart pretty quickly.

#### For Humanity's Survival in the 21st Century

Or better yet, to ensure we don't just survive, we thrive:
- what is better?
  - to have 1-5 billion people on earth in 2040 to attempt to
    terraform & correct for climate change?
    - this is the beta group
    - lower resource needs ... meh, maybe better chance for
      survival... maybe
  - or to have 8-12 billion people ready to tackle the same problems?
    - as well as whatever kinds of problems humanity will face around
      2040?

#### the beta's (1-5 billion people in 2040)

just think about it: how did these people get here?
- there must have been some massive depopulation event, right? Major
  war, systemic collapse of ecosystem followed by famine, epidemic,
  a technological disaster
  - whatever combination of events decimated half of the worlds
    population in 25 years
    - wouldn't you think that would be traumatic?
    - are the beta's
      - who experienced some combination of events so tragic, they
        create new architypes for worldwide culture (think Noah's
        flood)
      - are they going to be motivated to work hard to face whatever
        challenges ahead of it?
    - no, politics of fear and power emphacizing survival of self and
      opportunism will prevail!
      - a population that experiences something like this is not going
        to be adequately prepared and they may have a mess on their
        hands 100x worse than the world of 2020
- a disaster causing this much death will trigger widespread
  dispair. people will be difficult to motivate, especially in
  groups.
  - there might be a breakdown of established technological systems
    - think breakdown of FCC spectrum regulation
    - some of these things could be fucking terrible
  - in the face of a breakdown of:
    - social/regulatory norms,
    - supply chains,
    - trade,
    - stock/commodity/finance markets,
    - internet,
    - medical infrastructure,
    - technology controls
    - & food supply...
  - how do you think systems like these would fare in a world that
    *somehow* lost half its population in 25 years??....
    - not very well, right?
  - so, in the face widespread chaos and fear, where politics of
    power and opportunism are justified and ethics/values systems
    are forgotten...
    - then how could we possibly rebuild those systems listed above?
    - what kind of leaders is such a world likely to produce?

yeh, it might make for a good mad max sequel, but it's not what I want
my grandchildren to inherit (not that this is going to happen)
- why? because everyone at the top kinda knows: yes depopulation
  relieves stress from mother earth, but ... all in all: IT'D BE A
  FUCKING DISASTER!
  - it would leave 1-5 billion people a legacy of cultural trauma
    requiring a dozen generations to heal.

#### the alpha's (8-12 billion people in 2040)

So, for the survival of humanity, if there are 8-12 billion people,
then IMO that is 8-12 billion chances for impact!  And this is one of
the strongest forces motivating me to pursue a cultural revolution
that transforms our world's population today into a population which
is ready to face such struggles.

- it's because every one of those people alive is a chance for us to
  turn it around.
  - so if a revolution of empowerment sweeps across the globe,
    imagine the kind of combined impact humanity could have on the
    globe.
- Any day: I would prefer the alpha group!
  - 10+ billion invigorated and self-empowered individuals with some
    hard resource constraint problems.
  - over 1-5 billion scared victims of only God knows what, who are
    primarily motivated by fear and self-preservation.
    - the alpha group faced many of the same problems, but they
      prepared and compromised and sacrificed and worked together!!
  - btw, nanotech allows us to scalably expand to space, probably
    by 2030. there's your moonbase! lulz
- and at this point, we can extend our life and reproductive cycle
  with genetic engineering

(more here?)

basically, the question is:
- do we want our children to depend on a population who just went
  through an event with population effects on the level of 15th
  century europe?
  - this is a good parallel: how were the people of the 15th century
    affected by the black plague, culturally?
    - the point is to study this and make people aware of the costs of
      such a tragedy, so that we can avoid the cost of it.
  - these ppl are going to have some issues..
    - if those issues include war, ethnic tension, etc. then that
      means we'll perpetuate that in a time of higher tensions bc of
      resource constraints. thus, are more likely to continue holding
      those grudges further in the future
      - hate gives us more hate. if we experience problems because of
        that at the same time as humanity's greatest crunch (dealing
        with overpopulation) there may be some nations who experience
        pain that never heals
- or would we rather go with the population who didn't tear themselves
  apart with war and spent their resources applying that higher
  population's energy towards building solutions to prepare humanity
  for the 22nd century?

### quantifying social mobility

analyze linkedin/career/financial data science
- quantify vocality of political affiliation in archived social media
  data. same for other indicators: religion, ethnicity, etc
- by meshing this data, we should be able to develop an approximate
  measure of social motility and average social progress per political
  group. can also measure along other lines, but not kosher.
  - bc i think what we'll see is that conservative americans have been
    effectively marginalized from society by design. and this can be
    measured with analytics and social media data analysis.
  - name of factor being measured? ~social mobility?~

###

- a paradox of aristocracy (subsequent generations gradually lose the
  traits that allowed them to achieve their position in society)
- a paradox of social circumstances: today people are pushed towards
  the left in response to poverty, but never in human history have we
  had more tools at our fingertips for self-empowerment
  - when was the last time you bought an encyclopedia? seriously?
  - simultaneously, tech ventures model their business models around
    pushing content and monetizing our attention. but Americans need
    to look at poverty realistically. this will be easier if we have
    metrics on time utilization that correlates circumstance with
    behavior. the true causes of poverty are sobering. we often have
    more control over it than we realize or want to admit.
    - I've never received a dollar from the federal government, so I
      can say whatever the fuck I want here.

### why does it matter today?

- (separate article?)
- (more about these infuriating, manipulative tactics)
  - abusing social institutions and social mechanics
  - online discussions are coopted by trolls and a distict flavor of
    hiveminded ignorance, ...
  - effective censorship by newsfeed, especially for specific topics
    - this corrals discussion into controlled groups with limited
      exposure, with moderator censorship by veto.
      - only one moderator needs to disagree with your content for
        whatever reason for it to be effectively censored without
        explanation. it's quite often suppressed anonymously, though
        perhaps without malicious intent
    - ![In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream]
    - how does this change the 22nd century's perception of events
      today, if almost everything was suppressed and unindexable?
      content is unindexable when it can't be accessed by search
      engines. AFAIK, this includes almost all of facebook, except
      public posts. facebook benefits from having exclusive control
      over copyrighted content, so this is their motivation for
      excluding google/etc by default. facebook does archive their own
      data, but when this archived data is mostly exclusive, it makes
      the data statistically easier to manipulate in a cohesive way.
      - when people look back on history a century from now, what they
        will see is everything broadcast on TV and a deluge of
        information from *some* social media.
  - NSA utilizes social media manipulation to effectively mute
    dissenters online.
    - these tools in the wrong hands could empower a dictator
    - we built the machinery a totatitarian government could only
      dream of. we did it in secret, without discussion.
- there is a major push to socially encourage self-censorship
  - "oh, don't post things like that publicly. it will hurt your
    chances of getting a job... blah, blah, blah"
  - sociocultural incentives like this compel the far majority of
    people into self-censorship.
- the NSA has its tendrils in practically every technology company, so
  if you're restricted from speaking via NDA's with Google, Facebook
  or whoever, that means you can't speak out ... or your career is
  over.
  - the only people that can speak out are the extremely intelligent
    people who slipped under the radar who, for whatever reason, gave
    up the pursuit of a Silicon Valley career and just didn't give a
    fuck about everything else that might be taken away from them if
    they spoke out.
  - this is rare, because if you are intelligent in America, you are
    identified early on and they get your blinders on by undergrad at
    the latest. that is, you are encouraged to focus intently on
    specific problems *and nothing else*. the college system
    encourages the development of highly specific sets of knowledge
    - then you are burdened with a student loan and most people have
      no choice but to get straight to work.
    - you are controlled by debt and that's how debt works. it limits
      your choices in life.
  - as for me, I spoke out, but I never realized what was happening to
    me or how it was affecting my life. I didn't understand that
    people had methodically dissected my psychology and were
    surreptitiously distorting my social environments to push others
    away.

- math for scoring the 'health' of a person's local social graph and
  local financial graph.
  - is it possible to do this in an anonymous way?
  - observing that strong gradients in wealth and social influence
    gradually disperse
  - these metrics and methods for understanding/quantifying social
    influence need to be strongly and openly critiqued to ensure the
    model is accurate
    - it's easy to be deluded by the results of an invalid model and
      become overly confident in statistical analysis
    - these statistical models are structuralist and this is what the
      soviets thought could provide the perfect administration of
      society
      - these models are inherently fallible, but tempting for both
        those who would use them righteously and those who would use
        exploit them for power
    - however, statistical models powered by social media metrics can
      provide unprecedented insight into society.

- For america, we need democracy and capitalism. **America needs
  democracy because of the general protections on an individual's
  rights**: *speech, religion, property, life, liberty, ... pursuit of
  happiness and whatnot!*
  - however, because of how technology nature changes information &
    communication, it makes democracy less efficient & less likely to
    represent individuals
  - that doesn't mean it can't work or the people can't have power, it
    just means that our system needs to adapt to how information flows
    and how fast it spreads through a system.


=========

#### How the government systematically disempowers people

Surprise! When the government has collected a wide swath of
information secretly, your communications render your psychology an
open book. Worse, like a bad shrink, you can never validate what’s
been written down about you. So, if the gov’t is killing you softly,
you’d never know. And worse, if the national security apparatus
mistreated you, it will continue to justify it’s previous actions
post-facto with more bad information in the secret file you can’t
verify .... until you “go away.” So you will continue to be
psychologically harassed by strangers programmed with that bad intel
who push people away to ensure that no one gets close enough to their
mistake to ever verify the truth, basically until you commit suicide.
