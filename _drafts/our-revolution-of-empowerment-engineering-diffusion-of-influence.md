We need a revolution, not just in America, but across the world. There
isn't a better time for it than now.  However, revolutions can be
violent or involve large transfers of assets. We don't need any of
that. War is expensive, in terms of human and financial capital. For
assets in our economy, both the subversive transition of control and
the forcible transfer of ownership are expensive. They are morally
wrong, and a major drain on the economy at a time when we need America
to be as competitive as possible.

# [Our Revolution of Empowerment](#our-revolution-of-empowerment)

Imagine a revolution of empowerment. It starts with the individual, so
that we can transform the world from the ground up. This builds on the
ideas in this series: engineering the creation and diffusion of
influence in a society, but approaching this in a simple, common-sense
manner. With all the knowledge in the world, we delude ourselves into
forcing artificial changes, but when we grasp onto things tightly, we
always get it wrong and what we're left with isn't what we wanted at
all. Instead we should ensure that societal ills become more visible,
metrics are analyzed to ensure our tactics actually improve conditions
of poverty, and the solutions we implement naturally and actually
produce positive changes.

This doesn't start with waiting for someone to get in power. Our
revolution transcends identity. It doesn't start with the perfect ism
or the perfect social institutions operating with the perfect doctrine
and the perfect set of people. Instead, our movement assumes that
nothing is or can become perfect and entails constant
self-realization, not just of the individual, but of strata of
society. It starts with the individual, who once empowered and
relieved of restraint, can transform the world around themselves.

This self-realization requires education. Never in human history have
we had more tools at their fingertips for our collective
self-empowerment than we do now. Today, every person is empowered to
learn at minimal cost with minimal investment. Knowledge is power &
let's harness that. To manifest this and accelerate our
transformation, we'll need to utilize a bit of social engineering.

### [Turn Inwards And Conquer Inner Space](#turn-inwards-and-conquer-inner-space)

Instead of adopting the ideals of some ism or blaming our problems on
something external, we will turn inwards for our revolution. We will
conquer inner space, starting from the individual, rather than to seek
solutions outside. We need to conquer the negativity in our hearts
that leads to problems in the world. Everything good and everything
evil arises from our hearts and minds. Emotions, thoughts, words,
actions, rigid beliefs. It comes from our hearts first.

If we survive the next 100 years, we'll survive for 10,000 years.
Humanity has enough problems given our current circumstances and
possibility of catastrophe in the near future. Why should we permit
conflict to burden us more?! If we need the best aspects of the human
condition to inspire us through this next century, should we continue
to sow the worst seeds of human behavior, fallible at best and
malevolent when unchecked?

### [A Philosophical Battle](#a-philosophical-battle)

The major battle facing humanity today is philosophical. It may seem
technological, but it's not. It may seem the most urgent battle is
with nature or for resources, but it's not! The most crucial battle we
face in this decade and the next is philosophical: we must conquer
ourselves. We have to be intimately familiar with understand how
forces we can't imagine will change our lives. Known unknowns, unknown
knowns, and most importantly unknown unknowns. Humanity's
metamorphosis here won't be efficient, so how can we prepare the
cultures of 2030 to count on the fluid nature of information to stay
lean and stay agile? Again, this stands in stark contrast to the
typically slow pace of social engineering projects.

### [It's Not My World. I'm Just Living In It](#its-not-my-world-im-just-living-in-it)

Throughout the ages, people have burdened by artificial limitations
imposed by their belief systems, which are crafted to unify the
actions of the masses to some end. Walls are imposed and blocks are
placed in front of people to compel them towards cooperation towards
goals, many of which were in place before these individuals were born.
In most cases, the individual is compelled to choose between
struggling for their own dreams or giving those up and contributing
towards some
[Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_opus_(alchemy))
[Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Work).

This is the struggle between pre-determinism and free will, reified
into life through esoteric orders who, perhaps selfishly, use
individuals' lives towards their own ends. To these people, you're a
pawn in someone else's game, just like everyone else.

![Adjustment Bureau]()

Unless their own dreams mesh with this pre-existing grand plan and they
receive the blessings of the people around them, then any effort
towards their own ends is squandered. This is because, if you piss off
the wrong people, they will place wall after wall in front of you for
the rest of your life and then laugh at the way you squirm when you
don't understand why your life is a failure. They will orchestrate
this by interacting with you like a ship in a bottle and they will
never admit your strengths or victories and draw attention to your
failures and there is nothing you can do about it.

In the 21st century, this ends because of the tendancy towards
omnipresence of information. That is, belief systems themselves will
tend to decohere, then recongeal into a either a unified belief system
or a set of belief systems. This doesn't mean older belief systems
will fade away.

- in aggregate, these artificial walls and blocking mechanisms are
  incredibly harmful to people and to society.

# [A Joyful Revolution]

(The primary thesis:) in societies with different governmental
structures, what motivates people to work hard? In communist societies
and democratic, free-market societies, how does this differ? This
question is of utmost importance. In a free-market, democratic system,
it is a mix of financial and sociocultural incentivization that pushes
people to acheive more, for themselves and for society. In a communist
system, its primarily sociocultural. People are motivated through
social engineering, by which the Party creates values systems that are
designed to push people towards striving for some collective
end. These systems created by social engineering are far from perfect,
vulnerable to subversion and usually idealized by academics blinded by
their own righteousness.

- They believe that through their knowledge, they have all the
  answers, but are blind to the truly limited scope of their
  (knowledge).











<a name="a-cultural-revolution-and-a-cognitive-revolution" />

### [A Cultural Revolution *And* A Cognitive Revolution](#a-cultural-revolution-and-a-cognitive-revolution)

no... not that kind of cultural revolution

- expand on how education empowers individuals and how we can use
  technology to develop our minds.
  - We can transform our society through cognitive expansion.
  - [links to article on directive cognitive expansion]
- why does this help lift individuals out of poverty/etc?
  - from a philosophical standpoint, the body is simply a vehicle for
    the mind.
    - "equation" for life: spirit*(mind/body) ... i think that was it
      - to maximize their output from life, one must train the mind to
        harness their spirit, transcending the limitations imposed by
        their body. we all share physical limitations, btw (cut?)


###

Power and the circuits by which influence is transferred in society
operate in completely different manners in various governmental
systems. Communism minimizes wealth as a store of social influence by
design. To the detriment of America, most socialists and marxists do
not *truly* understand this or its consequences. They make a bargain
to improve their situation and harness demagoguery to get what they
want without understanding how it cripples evolutionary mechanisms,
the quality of life and degrees of freedom in society. *Ultimately,
Bolsheviks were deceived into becoming serfs for another master,
**with fewer options for transcending societal limitations**.*

###

Most of the left that hasn't studied political science, economics or
philosophy doesn't truly understand the post-revolution mechanics of
influence in communist and far-left societies. The left claims the
implementations of marxist and socialist ideas will reprieve the
burdens of the poverty unto which they were cursed by birth.

There are various strata of leftists, which determines their beliefs
and course of actions. Some are well-educated and some are
unfortunately not. Still, socialism and communism appeals to those
suffering in poverty and looking for someone to help them out. Some on
the far left very clearly do understand what they are doing to America
and the world, as obseqious as their tactics might be.

A pure marxist implementation of communism doesn't allow for wealth as
a means of influence whatsoever. Interest rates are simply too high
because of the macroeconomic policies used for centrally-planned
economies, so savings can't be accumulated without tremendous
sacrifice. This is by design and anyone saving too much is targeted as
a threat or expected to adhere to the interests of the
Party. Otherwise, poverty experienced in the developed world can be
transcended through hard work, virtuous behavior, avoidance of
destructive behavior, accumulation of savings and education.

###

Communism robs people of the ability to use capital and savings for
social influence. Just ask anyone who couldn't escape a Soviet
satellite state. Many people end up in such poverty that they couldn't
leave if they wanted to: *you cannot save money*. That is not to say
that free-market democratic societies are perfect. However, if we make
a hard left, we *will* find ourselves in a hole that is much deeper
and much harder to climb out.  Communist and far-left nations target
dissenting citizens to cull threats early and monopolize social
influence by compelling anyone with power to be "connected" to the
Party.

The only way to raise yourself in society is through compliance with
the Party, which installs a cult of personality in lieu of
religion. Institutions then encourage clever hacks of social mechanics
as common cultural practices to effectively short-circuit any possible
resistence, identifying and sorting the most vocal/passitionate
support. By encouraging carniverous behavior, one disempowers
resistence, motivates through fear, filters influential positions for
loyalty and encourages logistic turnover in organizations, which
ensures no one has a foothold long enough to gain their bearing to
manifest as a threat to power. It's like musical chairs.

Why did Stalin push for world revolution? Because the economics of
communism are only sustainable via empire and that's what it is: serfs
changing one master for another. An advance through Poland and into
Europe was planned before WW2 because the architects of Soviet
communism needed to power the services Bolsheviks promised with
economic expansion. Stalin anticipated resistence from the traditional
European powers.

#### Examine/Contrast incentivation/influence/values/ethics in democracy and communism

- Then, I'll discuss how individuals can "create" influence
  themselves. Similarly, I'll discuss how families, small groups and
  communities can work together to do the same

#### creation/diffusion of influence in society (from the bottom up)

After comparing those mechanisms for the "creation" and diffusion of
influence in society, I'll detail how individuals in most every
society can empower themselves by strengthening those influence
creation mechanisms => *particularly, education!*

### Study the Flux of Influence on the Macro and Micro Scales

- how else does influence flow in the micro scale?
  - what do we use it one? we need things (favors, jobs, etc) from
    each other on a small scale.
    - this can be explained in a kind of anarcho-capitalist way
  - typically anyone who's building their life upwards is gaining
      influence and power over their circumstances
    - but there are people who squander their money/etc through poor
      decisions or destructive lifestyles
    - and those who lose their money/influence because of conditions
      outside of their control

### Why are so many people encumbered with problems outside of their control?

- the question then becomes: why do so many people end up living in
  situations which are outside of their control or which they believe
  are outside of their control? *and then: how do we minimize these
  things?*
  - what is it that burdens us with problems that require expenditure
    or time or some other form of influence?
  - and how can we minimize such things at a micro-scale, so that it
    makes a difference on a larger scale

### Applying some of these ideas towards poverty

- and particularly I'm talking about poverty: how can we focus on
  cleaning up the kinds of problems which keep people encumbered with
  poverty?
  - our most valuable tool here is education.
    - how do we get people to embrace educational opportunities? how
      do we prevent gradual aversion of populace to education during
      our approach towards the singularity?
    - advances in technology, coupled with changes to society, are the
      primary reason i'm excited about this
  - one major tool (which intertwines with education)
    - cognitive development via the arts.
      - (expand on cognitive/metacognitive devlepment)
  - other tools include:
    - social engineering
      - institutions, subcultures, common practices, and (?) to focus
        on building sociological/psychological elements that push
        towards a common goals of:
        - interdependence
        - opportunity
        - influence creation/diffusion for society on the micro scale:
          individual/family/local/community
          - there are many initiatives for doing a lot of this
      - (e.g. app idea) identify citizens on social media or IRL who are
        isolated and find out why!
    - hmmm... others?

(after completing the main thoughts here, summary above should be a
bit more brief)

- as currency and wealth are really medium of exchange for what
  conveys a liquidity of influence,
  - (need to move the content in this section around. cover basics
    first, then lead into a new section to distinguish between more
    specific examples of moving wealth around)
  - then ultimately the question comes down to how does each system of
    governance and each society structure its mechanisms for
    diffusion of influence
    - basically, how does one acquire or dispense or accumulate
      influence in a particular society or type of government
      - this ends up being very different in each kind of system
      - easier to accumulate influence in capitalist societies because
        you can accumulate physical wealth converring influence
        - in communist command economies, it's difficult for one to
          accumulate wealth because taxes are very high,
          - private savings rates would usually be low (i think?)
            - expenses should usually be a higher proportion of
              someone's wages than in capitalist systems.
              - this isn't true when we lose the middle class
            - if wealth drives influence in capitalist systems, then
              restriction of wealth to a small segment of society
              means that region's citizens likely have less influence
              than they should
      - diffusion of influence is more tightly constrained in
        communist or socialist societies
        - this is restricted by rigid hierachies and party dominance
        - communication can be more heavily restricted. it's the norm
          instead of the exception, especially higher up the hierarchy
        - therefore it's more difficult for private individuals to
          confer influence
      - if influence exchanges (via wealth, role, or otherwise) could
        be mapped out in a graph for democratic and communist systems
        - for both, are the nodes in the graph would be defined by the
            hierarchical organizations of business, government, party
            and family/social institutions
        - the ways in which influence is exchanged in communist
          countries more closely aligns with the hierarchical
          structures of nodes.
          - influence is more likely to be exchanged with local nodes
            in the hierarchy
          - there would less edges connecting nodes across hierarchies
            for organizations and especially moving upwards in
            society.
            - this should mean it can be a bit harder for someone to
              work their way up in a country like this.
              - obviously one of the main ideas of communism is to
                empower the poor and the hardest working..
                - *but i'd love to talk with someone who's studied this
                  precise topic in political theory: how easy is it to
                  move upwards in society and how does that differ in
                  implementations of these two systems*
        - in democratic countries, because people are more free to
          design their own hierarchical structures, intermix b/w
          them, communicate freely, etc
          - then upward motion in society here is very much dependent on
            starting conditions, especially with regard to education
            and wealth
            - but again, this system also has mechanisms in place to
              ensure that we have opportunities for all
              - or it should, at least
          - the graph here would edges allowing influence to diffuse
            more freely across society,
            - however, because some groups accumulate significantly
              more wealth than others, this allows people to exert
              more control on the system as a whole
              - but IMO property rights are crucial. if your system
                doesn't protect property rights, it's not for me. it
                might work in other places....
                - i want to be motivated by what i can attain and i
                  want others to have the same. however, i'm motivated
                  by what i can attain to use for others' benefit.
                  that is, ultimately. as of now, i don't have
                  resources

- hierarchical structures & specialzation role (wtf??)
  - ughhh this was a more complete idea....

- anyways, the structures by which a society enables/controls the
  diffusion of influence lay the foundation for incentivization in
  society
  - this idea breaks down a bit in the face of a generally demoralized
    society that doesn't identify opportunities or completely lacks
    true opportunity for self-empowerment
  - these mechanisms of incentivizations include:
    - desire for a specific role
    - desire for power in hierarchy or local power/influence
    - desire to accumulate wealth
    - religion
    - education & culture
    - assets (both systems transfer influence via assets)
    - patriotism
      - this includes goals and dreams like those sold to us in
        advertising and via culture

- even though communism often lacks true property rights and thus,
  it can be hard to truly own something and control it completely or
  sell it
  - further, if you are permitted to sell real-estate and other assets
    on their more controlled market, then, since the gov't controls
    exchange of most assets on the market, they really have the
    advantage to determine market behavior.
    - also, with much lower savings rates, it becomes harder to find
      buyers for large assets. again, fewer merchants on the market
      means a market favors the government every time, or any group
      exchanging with significant investment in those assets
  - regardless of whether you have true property rights and the
    ability to sell in a disadvantageous market,
    - someone still needs to control who uses those asset resources
      and how. individuals associated with owners or government
      institutions decide how people use property of the state (and
      property "owned" by individuals)

- but the point is, the main incentivization structures for communism
  and democracy basically just exchanges $$$ for affluence with
  government institutions.
  - it's really one for another. both systems require the diffusion of
    influence through currency and social institutions.
    - communism and socialism with controlled economies depend more on
      leveraging institutions than cash
    - democracy with capitalsm depend more on wealth to act as a store
      of value, but really as a medium of exchange for influence
      - btw: VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLAR!! you can vote with a buck every
        day. do not empower those who you strongly disagree with.
        - this is the strongest means we have for changing behaviors
          and preventing actions we don't agree with.
        - you can't really "vote with your dollar" in a communist
          system. this yet another reason its citizens are left *more
          disempowered* than in free market systems
  - at the end of the day, we've exchanged diffusion of influence via
    $$$ for diffusion via hierarchical social institutions (kinda
    repeat of above)
    - the state often not only monopolizes the mechanism of influence
      diffusion, but also of influence "creation"
      - religions organizations are banned for this reason. they
        "create" influence through their own systems that acts as
        competition for other social institutions
      - media organizations are tightly controlled, in part for a
        similar reason: media has power over the information people
        engage with.
        - the media can therefore affect what people want, what they
          spend their time thinking about, their long term goals, what
          discussions the start around the water cooler at
          work... yotta yotta
- IMO, regardless of the system

- here's an idea though: why shouldn't that "creation" of influence
  originate at the individual/family/community levels first?
  - it already does in many ways. e.g. someone invests in a degree in
    a burgeoning field: boom, the individual has more influence.
  - but knowledge is power and education confers influence to
    individuals in society. therefore, if we can create social
    institutions which enable us to quickly more efficiently educate
    people, then we should

### Addressing Depopulation Conspiracy Theories

(Or... why this is really dumb, yet actually kind of a real thing)
- (hmmm i should just skip the discussion and get straight ot the
  point, removing most of this section)

- everyone knows there are contingency plans in place for marshall
  law, etc in America and every other country.
  - I'm sure you've heard about them in spooky youtube videos.
  - Not to completely discredit all of those videos, but most of them
    are bogus. the programs, however? they're real.
  - yet, they are well intentioned. only a criminally negligent
    government would lack a plan in case of a major, major disaster
    - the more resources they have to plan, the more complicated their
      disaster programs are.
    - yet, just because they exist doesn't mean that the government is
      plotting to use this stuff. they are ready; that is all.
- however, there are real conspiracies out there for depopulation
  involving viruses, war, etc. but most of this stuff is more about
  brainstorming potential disasters than planned massive depopulation.

forget the hypothetical conspiracy theories, which are often moreso
designed to keep you captivated and distracted. yes, that's right: I
just said conspiracy theories are conspiracy theories LMAO
- usually there's some truth to each of these. if there wasn't, they'd
  fall apart pretty quickly.

#### For Humanity's Survival in the 21st Century

Or better yet, to ensure we don't just survive, we thrive:
- what is better?
  - to have 1-5 billion people on earth in 2040 to attempt to
    terraform & correct for climate change?
    - this is the beta group
    - lower resource needs ... meh, maybe better chance for
      survival... maybe
  - or to have 8-12 billion people ready to tackle the same problems?
    - as well as whatever kinds of problems humanity will face around
      2040?

#### the beta's (1-5 billion people in 2040)

just think about it: how did these people get here?
- there must have been some massive depopulation event, right? Major
  war, systemic collapse of ecosystem followed by famine, epidemic,
  a technological disaster
  - whatever combination of events decimated half of the worlds
    population in 25 years
    - wouldn't you think that would be traumatic?
    - are the beta's
      - who experienced some combination of events so tragic, they
        create new architypes for worldwide culture (think Noah's
        flood)
      - are they going to be motivated to work hard to face whatever
        challenges ahead of it?
    - no, politics of fear and power emphacizing survival of self and
      opportunism will prevail!
      - a population that experiences something like this is not going
        to be adequately prepared and they may have a mess on their
        hands 100x worse than the world of 2020
- a disaster causing this much death will trigger widespread
  dispair. people will be difficult to motivate, especially in
  groups.
  - there might be a breakdown of established technological systems
    - think breakdown of FCC spectrum regulation
    - some of these things could be fucking terrible
  - in the face of a breakdown of:
    - social/regulatory norms,
    - supply chains,
    - trade,
    - stock/commodity/finance markets,
    - internet,
    - medical infrastructure,
    - technology controls
    - & food supply...
  - how do you think systems like these would fare in a world that
    *somehow* lost half its population in 25 years??....
    - not very well, right?
  - so, in the face widespread chaos and fear, where politics of
    power and opportunism are justified and ethics/values systems
    are forgotten...
    - then how could we possibly rebuild those systems listed above?
    - what kind of leaders is such a world likely to produce?

yeh, it might make for a good mad max sequel, but it's not what I want
my grandchildren to inherit (not that this is going to happen)
- why? because everyone at the top kinda knows: yes depopulation
  relieves stress from mother earth, but ... all in all: IT'D BE A
  FUCKING DISASTER!
  - it would leave 1-5 billion people a legacy of cultural trauma
    requiring a dozen generations to heal.

#### the alpha's (8-12 billion people in 2040)

So, for the survival of humanity, if there are 8-12 billion people,
then IMO that is 8-12 billion chances for impact!  And this is one of
the strongest forces motivating me to pursue a cultural revolution
that transforms our world's population today into a population which
is ready to face such struggles.

- it's because every one of those people alive is a chance for us to
  turn it around.
  - so if a revolution of empowerment sweeps across the globe,
    imagine the kind of combined impact humanity could have on the
    globe.
- Any day: I would prefer the alpha group!
  - 10+ billion invigorated and self-empowered individuals with some
    hard resource constraint problems.
  - over 1-5 billion scared victims of only God knows what, who are
    primarily motivated by fear and self-preservation.
    - the alpha group faced many of the same problems, but they
      prepared and compromised and sacrificed and worked together!!
  - btw, nanotech allows us to scalably expand to space, probably
    by 2030. there's your moonbase! lulz
- and at this point, we can extend our life and reproductive cycle
  with genetic engineering

(more here?)

basically, the question is:
- do we want our children to depend on a population who just went
  through an event with population effects on the level of 15th
  century europe?
  - this is a good parallel: how were the people of the 15th century
    affected by the black plague, culturally?
    - the point is to study this and make people aware of the costs of
      such a tragedy, so that we can avoid the cost of it.
  - these ppl are going to have some issues..
    - if those issues include war, ethnic tension, etc. then that
      means we'll perpetuate that in a time of higher tensions bc of
      resource constraints. thus, are more likely to continue holding
      those grudges further in the future
      - hate gives us more hate. if we experience problems because of
        that at the same time as humanity's greatest crunch (dealing
        with overpopulation) there may be some nations who experience
        pain that never heals
- or would we rather go with the population who didn't tear themselves
  apart with war and spent their resources applying that higher
  population's energy towards building solutions to prepare humanity
  for the 22nd century?

- a paradox of aristocracy (subsequent generations gradually lose the
  traits that allowed them to achieve their position in society)
- a paradox of social circumstances: today people are pushed towards
  the left in response to poverty, but never in human history have we
  had more tools at our fingertips for self-empowerment
  - when was the last time you bought an encyclopedia? seriously?
  - simultaneously, tech ventures model their business models around
    pushing content and monetizing our attention. but Americans need
    to look at poverty realistically. this will be easier if we have
    metrics on time utilization that correlates circumstance with
    behavior. the true causes of poverty are sobering. we often have
    more control over it than we realize or want to admit.
    - I've never received a dollar from the federal government, so I
      can say whatever the fuck I want here.

### why does it matter today?

- (separate article?)
- (more about these infuriating, manipulative tactics)
  - abusing social institutions and social mechanics
  - online discussions are coopted by trolls and a distict flavor of
    hiveminded ignorance, ...
  - effective censorship by newsfeed, especially for specific topics
    - this corrals discussion into controlled groups with limited
      exposure, with moderator censorship by veto.
      - only one moderator needs to disagree with your content for
        whatever reason for it to be effectively censored without
        explanation. it's quite often suppressed anonymously, though
        perhaps without malicious intent
    - ![In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream]
    - how does this change the 22nd century's perception of events
      today, if almost everything was suppressed and unindexable?
      content is unindexable when it can't be accessed by search
      engines. AFAIK, this includes almost all of facebook, except
      public posts. facebook benefits from having exclusive control
      over copyrighted content, so this is their motivation for
      excluding google/etc by default. facebook does archive their own
      data, but when this archived data is mostly exclusive, it makes
      the data statistically easier to manipulate in a cohesive way.
      - when people look back on history a century from now, what they
        will see is everything broadcast on TV and a deluge of
        information from *some* social media.
  - NSA utilizes social media manipulation to effectively mute
    dissenters online.
    - these tools in the wrong hands could empower a dictator
    - we built the machinery a totatitarian government could only
      dream of. we did it in secret, without discussion.
- there is a major push to socially encourage self-censorship
  - "oh, don't post things like that publicly. it will hurt your
    chances of getting a job... blah, blah, blah"
  - sociocultural incentives like this compel the far majority of
    people into self-censorship.
- the NSA has its tendrils in practically every technology company, so
  if you're restricted from speaking via NDA's with Google, Facebook
  or whoever, that means you can't speak out ... or your career is
  over.
  - the only people that can speak out are the extremely intelligent
    people who slipped under the radar who, for whatever reason, gave
    up the pursuit of a Silicon Valley career and just didn't give a
    fuck about everything else that might be taken away from them if
    they spoke out.
  - this is rare, because if you are intelligent in America, you are
    identified early on and they get your blinders on by undergrad at
    the latest. that is, you are encouraged to focus intently on
    specific problems *and nothing else*. the college system
    encourages the development of highly specific sets of knowledge
    - then you are burdened with a student loan and most people have
      no choice but to get straight to work.
    - you are controlled by debt and that's how debt works. it limits
      your choices in life.
  - as for me, I spoke out, but I never realized what was happening to
    me or how it was affecting my life. I didn't understand that
    people had methodically dissected my psychology and were
    surreptitiously distorting my social environments to push others
    away.

- math for scoring the 'health' of a person's local social graph and
  local financial graph.
  - is it possible to do this in an anonymous way?
  - observing that strong gradients in wealth and social influence
    gradually disperse
  - these metrics and methods for understanding/quantifying social
    influence need to be strongly and openly critiqued to ensure the
    model is accurate
    - it's easy to be deluded by the results of an invalid model and
      become overly confident in statistical analysis
    - these statistical models are structuralist and this is what the
      soviets thought could provide the perfect administration of
      society
      - these models are inherently fallible, but tempting for both
        those who would use them righteously and those who would use
        exploit them for power
    - however, statistical models powered by social media metrics can
      provide unprecedented insight into society.

- For america, we need democracy and capitalism. **America needs
  democracy because of the general protections on an individual's
  rights**: *speech, religion, property, life, liberty, ... pursuit of
  happiness and whatnot!*
  - however, because of how technology nature changes information &
    communication, it makes democracy less efficient & less likely to
    represent individuals
  - that doesn't mean it can't work or the people can't have power, it
    just means that our system needs to adapt to how information flows
    and how fast it spreads through a system.


=========

- the commonality of the human condition drives humanity's desire to improve it (rewrite)
  - that is, because we all understand the effects of negative/positive events in our own life
    - as well as their effects on the lives of those around us
    - we become conditioned with the desire to overcome it
  - when people witness or become aware of extremely unfair events
    - the human condition drives our desire to correct them
    - if someone has utilized unfair tactics to target someone's friends
      - then if those people become aware of these injustice's
      - they will be capable of empathizing with the strife and they will strive for justice
      - even if this means taking on some pain themselves
  - this can be harnessed to correct social injustice on a large scale
    - through non-violent intervention, such as that employed by Ghandi and Dr. King
    - at first, people like Ghandi and Dr. King were begged by their friends to just fall in line
      - to accept that which was unfair because it was "good enough" or "it could be worse"
    - but by getting attention with the right means
      - and drawing the people around them into the fight
        - who must be willing to accept pain in striving towards a better condition for everyone
      - these hero's were able to draw even more attention to injustices
    - and this is because, when people are presented with the right information from the right perspective,
      - they will almost always make the right decision
      - they will struggle for justice or change, even to their own detriment
  - this insurmountable desire for equinimity, justice and truth often lays dormant
    - but it can be tapped through the just the right push
    - and it is driven by the human condition
      - that is, the common experiences that we all face throughout our lives
      -
