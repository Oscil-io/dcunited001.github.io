# Part: Two

can transition from talking about tissue networks
- viewing tissue networks at various levels of scale
- behaviour determined by electrical fields
  - by a genomic, biochemical homonculus
  - a homonculus is your mental representation of your body,
    - with respect to various other mental faculties, like tactile
      sense, motion or prioperception
  - but there should be a genomic, biochemical homunculus which
    chemically drives the development of the nerves which drive
    electric impulses that determine tissue behaviors
    - that is, there should be some imprint of this in the
      genome/epigenome

## Spatially Distributed State

- is there a good example from the epigenetics class?
- explain what I mean by spatially distributed state
- transciptomes and nucleolus
  - use Process/Program & OS metaphors to describe these

(re)-explain spatially distributed state at a high level
- && hierarchically distributed state
- && physical distribution of cells imparts some higher order
  hierarchical distribution of state (than just cellular)
  - e.g. groupings of cell types, blood brain barrier
- && physical channels as mediation of state
  - && veins/lymph system in an optimal state, will provide some
    optimal opportunity for exchange of state between tissues
  - && ventricular system in the brain (need to look into details
    here)


spatially distributed state in the nucleus
- when operations are quick and repetitive, then modified state
  quickly accumulates around the source of events
  - there is also an offset effect, where the surrounding chemical
    messengers are crowded outwards and there are physical effects
    on the solution (osmosis, pressure, etc.)
- what other ways can genetic programs execute and alter state,
  locally?


### Metanomics and Tissue Networks

#### Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Tissue Maps

metanomics and probabilistic programming
- mapping out tissue networks in the human body using MRI (diffusion
  tensor imaging) + Yoga.
  - need to be able to map various spaces together
  - the yoga postures cause different blood flow patterns
  - statistical resolution should allow us to map out tissues by
    looking at networks of small veins and arteries down to
    capillaries
- this should revolutionize cancer treatments because you can tailor
  someone's treatment plan to target specific networks of tissues
  - you can know that if you take out a set of tissue subnetworks,
    that you have taken out all of the branches leading to them
  - if the cancer is confined to that area, then you can know that
    there's a much smaller chance of it coming back
    - you have annihilated the tissue 'feeding' the cancer
    - so therefore, there should be a much lower chance of it
      returning
- this is like a "connectome" for probabilistic programming
  - the connectome is the highest level of tissue interconnection, but
    is stratified itself, as it's a tree
  - the brain has a connectome and this can be observed by using
    diffusion tensor imaging and some learning
  - but the yoga in the methodology inserts some known level of
    variance into the system of veins/arteries for specific areas of
    the body
  - those areas get more blood and open up
    - the MRI images can be sewn together and with enough imaging
    - then a highly accurate model of the connectome for the brain and
      other organs can be constructed
