# アレクサンドリアの丏から

This is a series inspired by the battles we see waged against
censorship everyday. The menace of tyranny has been growing for years
and by the time we recognize it for what it is, it will be too late.

The development of all new ideas and knowledge is greatly hindered by
censorship of any kind. This includes philosophy itself. Furthermore,
America's stride towards social progress around the world has been
reduced to a wimpering stagger by censorship and manipulation of
social media. We promise such great works around the world, but what
does it say when the world can see we obviously can't speak openly at
home. If we pride ourselves on freedom to religion and freedom of
speech, what does this say? And what kind of election is this?!

The first essay will discuss the effect censorship has on the
development of knowledge in general. The second essay will cover
specific strategies for censorship in social media, as well as how its
implementation foments risk in the American economy by threatening to
undermine trust in technology products and restricting available
markets for our products. The third essay will combine ideas from the
first two to discuss how social media censorship isolates individuals,
divides people and creates more problems than it could solve.

# What Kind of 21st Century Do You Want?

Ahead of us, lay some important decisions that will decide the fate of
the world. Not just America or Europe or the Western world. What we
decide in these next five years and how we react to specific trends
will determine the fate of the world. We must decide: what kind of
21st century do we want to live in? What kind of 21st century do we
want our children and grandchildren to inherit? What will they think
of us?

These are crucial decisions that we must make and history will judge
us from the 22nd century. Many of the destinations for these trends
are inevitable and the forces that drive them are unstoppable! We must
consider these trends and questions individually, as families, as
communities, as nations AND AS ONE!

This is not a "dark" vision of the future! I am tired of being ignored
and recessed as if I am something to be hidden away and swept under
the rug! This is a realistic vision of things that will come to pass
and it is because of the nature of information; it is inherently
metaphysical! I am not going to get into the specifics of *the
prophecy*, but there is nothing any person or group can do to stop the
things I am talking about. You could destroy me and destroy every
fragment of my memory and it would not matter! The truth is I, as an
individual, am irrelevant! And yet, I don't think my job here is done.

In the end, there is one future and it cannot be denied. The only
question is -- how will we get there? Will we be together when we
arrive? Or will we rip ourselves apart trying to fight our fate or
profit from our destiny?

So, instead, we have to determine not where we are going, but how we
are going to get there! Do we want the path towards this future to be
violent? Or do we want it to be peaceful? Do we want this future to
include everyone and all cultures? Of course we do! And we have to
determine whether we want to reach this future after decades of bloody
conflict! Do we want that?! *HELL NO WE DON'T!* If global warfare breaks
out, we will be incapable of responding to environmental threats!
Formerly prosperous regions will be burdened by economic stagnation.

## What Is Best For Humanity?

So, assuming our destination is a foregone conclusion and
understanding that we are accelerating towards it, it would be wise to
take a look at how we've arrived to our current position thus far. How
did humanity get here? How is it that we developed all the technology
that we have today? Why is that relevant to censorship?

> Also, please do note that the communication infrastructure of the
> future completely circumvents censorship: at the level of the
> infrastructure! It will be completely decentralized. So, not only
> would it be unwise to implement widespread censorship, this is the

- how did we get to where we are now?
  - what truly matters most?

- two different paths for the 21st century with regard to availability
  of information.

- when a nation blocks access to ideas or restricts dialogue on
  specific ideas or prevents people from learning and developing,
  every citizen in that nation suffers because their intellectual
  development as a culture stagnates.
  - qaddafi's citizens weren't allowed to learn foreign languages
    - or was it gaddafi? did anyone else find it strange when we
      started spelling this guy's name in two different ways?
- however, we're going to be living in a world where censorship of
  some technologies and ideas is necessary because they are
  dangerous.
  - so how do we fairly block access to those who would do harm with
    those technologies while preventing abuse of this system by those
    who would make themselves gatekeepers to this kind of knowledge?
- IMO, dicussion on censoring dangerous technology is less relevant
  than censoring people, groups and current events in social media


### A Chinese "Library of Alexandria" Event

- [Burning of Books and Burying of Scholars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars)
- [Records of the Grand Historian (first emporer of Qin Dynasty)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_the_Grand_Historian)

# Philosophy of Censorship

## The Library of Alexandria is a Metaphor

- The library of Alexandria as a metaphor for the internet.
  - what made the library so special in the ancient world?
  - why did the Romans burn it? what advantage would they gain from
    this?
  - was this event unique? why not?
  - what "thing" distinguished european culture and development from
    the rest of the world? why did we end up developing?
    - the answer has absolutely nothing to do with innate genetic
      superiority. it's instead a cultural peculiarity and a mix of
      geopolitical/economic advantages.
    - the reason is that we were the first to have an industrial
      revolution. that's it.
      - then the question becomes: why were europeans the first to
        have an industrial revolution?
        - arabians and indians developed superior math well before
          europeans. there was superior technology available in the
          far east. Marco Polo didn't even know how to make ice cream.
  - so then, what was the thing that got us to the industrial
    revolution first? IMO, it was this cultural peculiarity of sharing
    knowledge, coupled with shared economic incentives and
    withstanding widespread cultural invasion. basically, Christianity
    established a cultural foundation that both unified Europe and
    propagated a system of values, while withstanding invasion long
    enough to reach the industrial revolution.
    - While being unified through Christianity, Europe was also fairly
      decentralized, so when we achieved technological innovations,
      they could never be horded into one place. In China, there were
      times when philosophy and technology were horded by a tiny
      ruling classes and this knowledge disappeared entirely from the
      rest of society.
    - The same kind of event happened when the Library of Alexandria
      burned to the ground.  This destroyed the extent of knowledge
      available to western society, while allowing some of it to be
      preserved by the ruling class.  These knowledge hording events
      happened over and over again and IMO, if we don't watch it,
      we're going to see one happen again with the internet.  Just as
      such events stagnated regional development in the past, THIS
      WILl STAGNATE OUR DEVELOPMENT! Except, this time, it will occur
      on a global scale!

#### there are cultures that seem to blacklist specific ideas.

  - this includes Russia in the 2000's (I think) and it even includes
    America, to some extent. America has always suppressed a few,
    specific ideas. Obscenity was a big deal in the 60's, for example.
    - anybody remember *Deep Throat?*
  - this isn't so bad, in itself. it really depends on how it's used,
    but one could argue there are some ideas that must be censored.

- more examples here:

#### there are other countries which whitelist ideas

  - they "encourage" that ideas to be the only things you think
  about. their leaders espouse some cult of personality. nearly
  everything else outside that is restricted. not on merit, but on the
  principle that other ideas might provide competition for the state's
  mindshare, the marketshare of thought and discourse!!
  - this should scare the !@#$ out of you, by the way
  - some nations will outlaw religion, for example. Christianity, in
    particular, because they are SCARED of a KING WHO CANNOT BE
    KILLED! they cringe in fear when they realize that their populace
    might hold them to the standard of a man who died 2,000 years ago!
    some of these people claim he doesn't even exist! but for someone
    who doesn't exist, Christ sure exerts a lot of power over us.
  - we need this in society. our leaders need to fear being held up to
    a higher standard. they cannot be granted the ability to make or
    break rules and laws on whims. they cannot be allowed to decide
    what's ethical or moral today, just to change it again next week.
- regardless of what you think about religion or God or the flying
  spaghetti monster, you should beware the militant atheist who would
  deny the right to God for everyone. in general, beware the person
  who would force you to believe that every path except the one they
  follow is wrong. this is much different than those who try to
  convince you that their path is the only right path.

### how do we develop new ideas?

- to distinguish b/w an idea that is truly "new" and those that are
  not, we have to compare it to everything we know.
  - an individual can compare ideas to those he/she knows or to those
    that are available to his society or to those available to some
    group/subgroup
  - if a person is comparing an idea to those he knows individually,
    he needs to be familiar with each idea to discern how similar each
    is. if the idea in consideration is new, then it will be highly
    dissimilar with most or all of those ideas.
  - if the person is trying to expand the set of ideas available to a
    group, like his community or his country or the world
    - then they need to be familiar with not just the set of ideas
      available to themselves, but also to the world.
    - this means the person must be fairly knowledgeable, all around
- so therefore, by whitelisting appropriate ideas or blacklisting more
  than just a few, a society does themselves a grave disservice.
  - they prevent themselves from expanding to new ideas.
  - when some ideas are difficult to talk about or think about, it
    becomes difficult or *impossible* to reach other conclusions.

### the transmission and retention of ideas is a transgenerational concept

  - all you have to do to make everyone forget an idea, person,
    place or thing is make people stop talking about it for 2 to 3
    generations.
  - even if it does not disappear completely, it will lose power or
    relevance.
  - there are people who know this and they specifically seek to
    suppress ideas long enough for them to disappear. to do so, you
    must do it silently. you must convince people they should not talk
    about specific things or think about them or share them with other
    people.
    - if you can reduce people's thought or speech on a topic for a
    few generations, you can almost remove it from the noosphere.
- ... more here?

### someone is pulling some serious fuckery in this country

- and it starts with censorship. the dialogue is stifled. we can't
  talk about things. why not? who said we don't have free speech? WHO
  THE !@#$ SAID THAT? Did we pass a law about that? Is there a law
  that says you can't write bad philosophy? Or that if you do, people
  aren't allowed to read it? WHAT THE !@#$????
- i think it's some kind of foreign influence, but i don't know who
  they are or how "they" are organized.
- but they are screwing with the structure of society. they are
  removing people from positions of influence. they are restricting
  free speech. they are isolating people who are threats. they are
  ruining families. they are assaulting religion (or they tried to in
  2014!) they are disempowering individuals.
  - THIS IS PART OF A CONCERTED STRATEGY.
    - these are traditional bolshevik-type tactics

### i don't know who these people are, but you should be afraid.

  - because by the time you realize what's going on, america will be
    on its knees and essentially in bondage.
    - they aren't afraid to abuse the national security apparatus to
      push people around or rob them of their income and their sense
      of community.
      - those people who do misuse this: why don't they attack islamic
        radicalism? that's a really good question!
  - the people fighting for these changes think it will work out for
    them. but when america loses, all americans lose.
  - if our economy ceases to function, we cannot collect taxes to pay
    for the services that the left values so much. that we all value.
  - if there is some other significant problem that constrains
    american influence or power, again, it's going to be tough for all
    americans. all americans will lose!

### ALL THREATS => FOREIGN **AND** DOMESTIC

- these people, whoever they are, whether they are foreign or
  domestic: they are using dangerous, divisive, subversive tactics and
  they just basically do not care. they are amoral. they do not care
  whether they need to threaten your family. they might say they'll
  stand up for you. they do not respect God and they'd rather America
  be a Godless nation.
  - but, as we've all read before, once they taken everyone else away,
    who'll be left to stand up for you?!
  - if you stand idly by and watch our country's influence and
    prestige erode away, truly who will be left to stand up for you?
  - we absolutely cannot let this happen.

### HOW ARE WE **AS AMERICANS** LETTING THIS HAPPEN?!!

end of part one?





=============

describe how political movements can encourage its members to take
action online.
- some of those actions just help a movement grow.  that
  is, they aren't negative or divisive on their own. but in particular,
  a political/religious movement can encourage its members to take
  actions, the consequences of which they might not fully understand and
  the results of which, when combined with the feedback loops and
  vulnerabilities in machine learning algorithms cause significant harm
  to society.


- example: "birther" movement:
  - encouraged Barack Obama's most vocal (and perhaps most irrational)
    opposition to self-identify on social media.
    - well ... now you have a list of your most energetic opponents to
      harass IRL.
  - explain that our online words and actions have lasting effect that
    most of us don't understand.
    - younger people don't understand because they're young and don't
      understand the consequences
    - older people dont' understand because they're sometimes
      unfamiliar with technology and they don't understand it's
      capabilities

- explain how i "got lucky" fighting online censorship
  - i was very vocal before these web applications had the technical
    capacity for censorship and before our post-911 education system
    had engrained specific cultural "things" in our youth that
    encouraged them to avoid raising their voices.
    - there's something very, very different b/w people that graduated
      high school before 2006-ish and those that graduated
      afterwards. and particularly those who graduated after like
      2012ish.
      - the younger they are, the MORE AMORAL they are. i don't know
        if it's just confirmation bias from my personal perspective,
        but i have seen some of the worst of humanity hiding behind
        the smuggiest, overly-confident smirks.

facebook censorship:

unsubscribing has implicit negative feedback on newsfeed algorithms:
- not only do you hide that person from your view, but the lack of
  interaction encourages

if people are encouraged to unsubscribe on a political basis
- that can create isolated communities of people
- and bc of the feedback effect from unsubscribing
  - this isolation is more pronounced
  - then there's another feedback effect where because social circle
    of people that are isolated online, then it narrows the set of
    information those people are exposed to
    - this, when combined with clustering algorithms that facebook
      would use to determine the "kinds" of people that are interested
      in various categories of things, then this would lead to
      significant distortion in what people see
    - so that leads to further effects
- most of this is made much worse by unsubscribing


it seems that every fresh channel that i use gets OK feedback,
sometimes they'll get an incredibly response
- then, every time after that, I get such a mediocre response

there's no real way to get around this censorship
- you can register accounts with new email addresses
  - but then your new accounts have no



What makes me sick is that the left is stifling debate in academia and
in the media, putting politics in gridlock. The left mostly controls
Silicon Valley, though they are fairly impartial with regard to
technological implementation. However, nearly all of the communication
out there has shifted towards social media and online messaging
platforms. So if you get censored for some reason, that's kind of a
big deal.

The algorithms used for this are susceptible to passive and active
attacks/manipulation. When the NSA surveils, that's passive. If the
NSA were to subvert Facebook servers to alter Newsfeed rankings,
that's active. If DHS were to subtly encourage massive unsubscribes
from a person (somehow), that's passive because it's not coming from
within the Facebook application. Among other factors, when anyone
unsubscribes from you, this contributes to a feedback effect within
Facebook algorithms. This drives isolated subnetworks of users on
facebook, partially cut off from the Graph by political
differences. If anyone encourages systemic unsubscribes (E.G. for
political reasons!) then this contributes to those same feedback
effects that further !@#$ with the Facebook newsfeed algorithms!!!

I cannot emphasize this enough, but these could have MASSIVE
implications for the American economy, but it doesn't seem the left
really even gives a shit! And it really feels like censorship out
there!! Like political censorship. It's like we have our own Iron
Curtain over America, but it's more like a Silicon Blanket. And almost
all communication is via online interaction now. If you're censored
online, you're just wasting your time basically. If you were at a
party and everyone you talked to walked away from you, you'd probably
change your behavior, but with online interactions, YOU CAN'T SEE THAT
HAPPENING. So you continue wasting your time...

- mention shadowbanning (weaponized social media)
- how to determine whether or not you're being shadowbanned or
  your content is being shadowculled
  - to determine this, you have to know how this process works for
    both the corporations enabling this censorship and for shadowy
    government agencies participating in it.
  - there must be some "rules"
  - those rules are based on "costs"

- economic cost (the blowback of being caught on a massive scale)
  - for a second here, forget about the economic cost of snowden's
    revelations because those were mostly passive surveillance
    programs. but there was still a pretty large economic cost, wasn't
    there? people lost trust in these apps!
  - the corporations facilitating this, they don't want people to know
    it's happening

- intelligence cost
  - when people in various foreign countries post content to social
    media products, this produces content metrics.
    - this can be coupled with usage metrics to gauge how important
      that content was to the people who posted it and the people who
      interacted with it
  - so, when you're censoring or culling content on a political basis,
    guess what! you're losing the authenticity of those metrics, both
    content and usage. you're actually blinding yourself.
    - but there's a game theory element here. countries or groups can
      conduct informational warfare by altering the content format &
      metrics.
      - furthermore, they can simulate interactions to alter the usage
        metrics. this can mislead adversaries or algorithms.
      - for example, you can mistrain translation algorithms to make
        it harder for people to export your nation's content because
        it's more difficult to process your language.
    - this is all information warfare. write me a check please.

- however, this can distort the signals that we read from social media
  - that's true for both intelligence agencies and for businesses!
  - if we're muffling the response to some event, we can't
    authentically read the response to it.
    - what if we should know that if 10,000 people post about some
      event, this should indicate a possible terror threat, but no one
      is reading the analytics from that hashtag because it's being
      shadowbanned or shadowculled!
  - then you might say the right hand doesn't know what the left hand
    is doing!
    - if these tactics are being done in an organized manner, there
      won't be the "authentic" data and the "post-censored"
      data. there will just be the social media signals data as it
      appears. there are several reasons for this:
      - organizational and logistical reasons: if you're really
        censoring data, you don't want anyone to be able to question
        that, right?
      - reasons relating to engineering challenges: here, it's just
        not possible to have your cake and eat it too. we're lucky to
        be able to do half the stuff we can do with stream processing
        architectures.
      - introducing a censorship layer to this is incredibly
        complicated, but probably not impossible. the internet already
        appears to be a bit balkanized. yet, this is antithetical to
        these corporations mission statements and to their
        stockholder's bottom lines. you're just not going to be able
        to convince them to invest in this infrastructure without
        pointing guns to their backs! and if you do, you're still
        going to have HUMINT logistical challenges.

- what are the "rules" here? the people in charge of shadowbanning a
  hashtag, topic or domain have costs attributed to their actions
  - one of those costs is the cost of being caught culling someone's
    content
    - if someone is having their content, tweets or shares culled out,
      they're wasting their time, but if they know this or they find
      out, they're going to invest their energy elsewhere. thus,
      they'll escape the 'stasis' you've placed them in.
    - so that's one "cost". they don't want the person to find out
      because they'll react to it.
    - another cost to being caught here is that

- the technical "rules"
  - how does one cull content or links from a particular domain
  - it's a hard enough problem simply getting these web applications
    to work!
  - containerized web applications.
    - it's entirely possible to ... yada yada yada
      - requires HUMINT resources
  - layer 1,2,3,4,5 hacks
    - level3 and other internet backbone service providers
  - BGP hacks
    - silent IP rerouting
  - SSL hacks
    - when combined with ip rerouting
      - is basically, Konami's up-up, down-down, left-right,
        left-right, ...
    - if you have those SSL hacks, combined with BGP hacks (or any
      hack that lets you redirect specified traffic streams through
      servers/routers of your choosing) ...
      - you fucking win
    - and they do have all of this! several times over!!!!x!x!x!x!x!x!
    - however, there's a lot of moving parts here. and those moving
      parts lead to the potential for major bugs.
      - again, a great example of government interference in the free
        market leading to catastrophic problems! ... eventually
      - but government interference in this case leads to minor
        quality of service glitches.  just weird things that don't
        work right. unexplainable bugs, etc.
      - yet, when the full scope of this activity is known, it leads
        to a collapse in trust in US Technology products!! BECAUSE THE
        GOVERNMENT WOULDN"T GET THE FUCK OUT!

- the HUMINT "rules"
  - basically, you need to have people inside technology companies
    that you can leverage. preferably people closer to the top.
  - IMO, this is everywhere! as far as I can see, these people who can
    be leveraged, either directly or indirectly, are everywhere in the
    technology industry!

- so, how to fight back?



- a digital "bill of rights"
  - why? need to expand on these ideas before writing part 3

===========




exactly. also, your true value in social media comes from the unique
content you post/create. or at least, if you identify a story earlier
than others, that should be reflected in your reputation in the
newsfeed algorithms...

the dems are exploiting web applications and their algorithms to
project an intended appearance and to isolate/divide americans. these
algorithms already have their own weaknesses that encourage clusters
of users to become more clustered. they already have those weaknesses,
as they are. but these weaknesses can be abused to increase that
effect.

===========

because facebook and twitter newsfeed algorithms are perceived to be
"fair" the presentation of trends in social media is perceived to be
more authentic.
- i really don't believe that the average american understands how SEO
  and social media strategies work.
  - so unless the average american is leaping to conclusions as to how
    to control the presentation of information and trends on social
    media, then they are more likely to trust it more
    - it's a bit like the difference in publicity and advertising with
      regard to authenticity and trust
- if we were more aware of how to manipulate these things, then we'd
  be more cynical about what we see. it's easy to cause articles,
  topics and events to trend.
  - similarly, it's fairly simple to distract from an issue that just
    recently began trending online.
    - you basically try to trend other things and crowd it out
    - we are seeing so much of this happen!
  - this is all *passive* interference with technology and social
    media, by the way.
    - this is all possible without interfering with the operation of
      web applications!
      - if one was to actively interfere with web application, using
        the NSA for example, then it'd be fairly easy for technology
        companies to identify this behavior *and they would be
        pissed!*
    - doing this in almost any capacity is incredibly irresponsible
      and shows total disregard for the American economy!
      - it irreversibly damages the world's trust in American
        technology products, which is WHY I don't think it would
        happen.
      - if someone in power did this:
        - without taking the utmost care
        - or having the most dire need to do so
          - in no more than a handful of cases!
        - then that shows a reckless disregard for the American
          economy! this person or this group does not give a shit
          about America. At this point, technology, software and
          hardware are some of the few things that the American
          economy actually does have. And this is why I don't think
          it's going on, actually....
    - to make it clear, actively interfering with the operation of web
      applications is not the same thing as passive surveillance.  or
      even *passive* techniques to manipulate social media and/or SEO
      -- these imply utilizing the system in the same way as normal
      users would.
      - more active interference would require specific knowledge of a
        web application's design and codebase.  and I'm just going to
        leave it at that.

- how unsubscribes affect social media algorithms (outlined above)
  - a political movement could request that its supporters unsubscribe
    from users who post about specific topics. if they did so, this
    would cause a runaway effect that would lead to americans being
    isolated online and divided
    - they might not even be aware of the magnitude of effect that
      such a tactic would have! but it's pretty big.
      - social media newsfeed algorithms depend on getting signals
        that indicate how many people respond to your content
      - when your content receives little to no exposure, there's a
        feedback loop. reduced exposure leads to reduced likes,
        reduced likes and interaction leads to further reduced
        exposure.
        - when combined with clustering, categorization and
          recommendation algorithms, this leads to further isolation

  - when you're isolated online, you don't know that you're wasting
    your time! you might try to reach out to others, but you won't see
    why you're not getting through. it helps to have data and
    analytics. having access to google analytics helped me gamify the
    promotion of my blog and within a week or two, i instantly
    understood much of what I was doing wrong!
    - but i've been using facebook for years and I still have no idea
      why i can barely get a single person to like any of my posts.

- [like-farming and social-media tactics](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2016/02/27/dont-click-like-on-facebook-again-until-read-this.html)

and so, how do the social media & SEO censorship/distraction tactics
above affect the model of censorship outlined above.
- consider a graph with a temporal component that can be grouped to
  show the set of topics an individual or groupings of individuals
  have seen.
  - you can consider or understand everything someone saw today or last week or
    last month.
    - and you can do the same for groups of individuals
- social media censorship/distraction limits the ideas that people are
  exposed to
  - in the same way that cultures can blacklist or whitelist ideas or
    topics, these tactics do the same in a way that limits that graph
    - you can particularly effect the range of ideas that someone is
      exposed to
      - again, another feedback loop with newsfeed algorithms. by
        eliminating some topics or distracting from them, this shifts
        the discussion elsewhere. people talk about other topics and
        those are given much greater exposure.

- newsfeed algorithms should almost incorporate their antithesis
  - instead of focusing on what drives activity, they should also
    cause other topics to be featured, just to avoid the potential for
    feedback loops.
    - unsubscribes should have a timeout or something.  if you don't
      want to see what someone posts, at least send the clear
      indication to that person. just drop them from your friends
      list. unsubscribes are just one more passive aggressive
      interaction in our society. there are far too many avenues for
      passive aggressive behavior with social media.
  - these problems are difficult for developers and data scientists to
    observe and measure, so the people designing these things aren't
    necessarily at fault.
    - there are so many feedback loops in the newsfeed
      algorithms. that's really where the problems are. i don't have
      access to any of this data and I don't have much machine
      learning experience, beyond a few courses, but I can see the
      effect that manipulating these algorithms have.  I feel isolated
      in real life and online and I struggle to understand why.
  - furthermore, there are economic pressures which motivate SEO &
    Social Media companies to circumvent measures taken by newsfeed
    algorithms to promote fairness. they are encouraged to manipulate
    these algorithms for their benefit.

  - so apparently, those in charge of censorship don't actually care.
