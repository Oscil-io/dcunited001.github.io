For the record, i wanted to post my brain online for many reasons.  First of all, I did it for science of course.  It'd be great for more of this data to be available online for people to study and work with.

There are many anonymized datasets available on Radiopaedia. http://radiopaedia.org/ I've spent quite a bit of time studying neurological conditions on that site and on wikipedia. Those are more useful, but anonymized. I'm not sure that there are many healthy MRI datasets available there, which makes it more difficult to statistically model MRI data.  

I'm hoping to use Nipy and Dipy to create visualizations of my brain.  In particular, i'm hoping to recreate some of the Diffusion Tensor Imaging work in this talk by Ariel Rokem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdrSZtB0uX0.  However, i'm not sure if my DT images are high enough resolution.

I also did it for philosophical reasons. I believe that all digitized information past and present will be inevitably become known & public post facto. It's the nature of information & knowledge in our technological world to distribute itself until the world converges on total information omnipresence. So if, in the end, all [digitized] information is known, then there is no point in hiding information. This is more of a philosophical viewpoint though.  obviously it's impossible for all information to converge in this way.

But this is true even of our own minds. And if our mind can be digitized from our brain, this also has interesting security implications. If you've seen the show stitchers, then you know what i mean.

Also, I wanted my brain to be online in a widely distributed, public manner.  In case of robot apocalypse.  Hopefully, a quantum computer in the future would have low-bandwidth write access to my brain in the past.  Then I would be one of the earliest targetable maps of the brain on the public internet.  And the people of the future can just 


Under no circumstances was this done in the name of art.

I don't think we need to scan 100% of the brain in molecular detail in order to read & preserve the information. It should be possible to observe the circuitry at a higher level and recreate an approximation -- though it'd be just that, an approximation. Additionally, much of the information could be compressed to a much more lightweight format than digitizing the physical neural networks of the brain.

Digitizing a static physical model of the brain is problematic in itself. Many regions and structures in the brain are likely structurally dynamic. That is, the neural circuitry could change structure from day to day and this is definitely true over longer timescales. So it'd be much easier to read the data from the brain into another format rather than emulate the physical structure of the hardware.

I've thought a bit about information could be read from MRI scans such as these. In the absence of higher resolution data, I don't think there could any memories retrieved. I don't know the low-level details of how MRI data is encoded, but I do know it is recorded in slices. To retrieve memories, you'd need to read 3D regions from the brain. And it'd need to be much more high-resolution.

However, statistical modeling is incredibly powerful. It wouldn't surprise me to see techniques that can 'fill in the gaps' to some extent, similar to how photoshop can paint over regions of an image with contextually appropriate textures.  However, techniques like that wouldn't be able to make very accurate extrapolations.
