## Philosophy of Censorship

the development of philosophy (and knowledge in general) is greatly
hindered by censorship.
- when a nation blocks access to ideas or restricts dialogue on
  specific ideas or prevents people from learning and developing,
  every citizen in that nation suffers because their intellectual
  development as a culture stagnates.

#### there are cultures that seem to blacklist specific ideas.

  - this includes Russia in the 2000's (I think) and it even includes
    America, to some extent. America has always suppressed a few,
    specific ideas. Obscenity was a big deal in the 60's, for example.
  - this isn't so bad, in itself. it really depends on how it's used,
    but one could argue there are some ideas that must be censored.

#### there are other countries which whitelist ideas

  - they "encourage" that ideas to be the only things you think
  about. their leaders espouse some cult of personality. nearly
  everything else outside that is restricted. not on merit, but on the
  principle that other ideas might provide competition for the state's
  mindshare, the marketshare of thought and discourse!!
  - this should scare the !@#$ out of you, by the way
  - some nations will outlaw religion, for example. Christianity, in
    particular, because they are SCARED of a KING WHO CANNOT BE
    KILLED! they cringe in fear when they realize that their populace
    might hold them to the standard of a man who died 2,000 years ago!
    some of these people claim he doesn't even exist! but for someone
    who doesn't exist, Christ sure exerts a lot of power over us.
  - we need this in society. our leaders need to fear being held up to
    a higher standard. they cannot be granted the ability to make or
    break rules and laws on whims. they cannot be allowed to decide
    what's ethical or moral today, just to change it again next week.
- regardless of what you think about religion or God or the flying
  spaghetti monster, you should beware the militant atheist who would
  deny the right to God for everyone. in general, beware the person
  who would force you to believe that every path except the one they
  follow is wrong. this is much different than those who try to
  convince you that their path is the only right path.

### how do we develop new ideas?

- to distinguish b/w an idea that is truly "new" and those that are
  not, we have to compare it to everything we know.
  - an individual can compare ideas to those he/she knows or to those
    that are available to his society or to those available to some
    group/subgroup
  - if a person is comparing an idea to those he knows individually,
    he needs to be familiar with each idea to discern how similar each
    is. if the idea in consideration is new, then it will be highly
    dissimilar with most or all of those ideas.
  - if the person is trying to expand the set of ideas available to a
    group, like his community or his country or the world
    - then they need to be familiar with not just the set of ideas
      available to themselves, but also to the world.
    - this means the person must be fairly knowledgeable, all around
- so therefore, by whitelisting appropriate ideas or blacklisting more
  than just a few, a society does themselves a grave disservice.
  - they prevent themselves from expanding to new ideas.
  - when some ideas are difficult to talk about or think about, it
    becomes difficult or *impossible* to reach other conclusions.

### the transmission and retention of ideas is a transgenerational concept

  - all you have to do to make everyone forget an idea, person,
    place or thing is make people stop talking about it for 2 to 3
    generations.
  - even if it does not disappear completely, it will lose power or
    relevance.
  - there are people who know this and they specifically seek to
    suppress ideas long enough for them to disappear. to do so, you
    must do it silently. you must convince people they should not talk
    about specific things or think about them or share them with other
    people.
    - if you can reduce people's thought or speech on a topic for a
    few generations, you can almost remove it from the noosphere.
- ... more here?

### someone is pulling some serious fuckery in this country

- and it starts with censorship. the dialogue is stifled. we can't
  talk about things. why not? who said we don't have free speech? WHO
  THE !@#$ SAID THAT? Did we pass a law about that? Is there a law
  that says you can't write bad philosophy? Or that if you do, people
  aren't allowed to read it? WHAT THE !@#$????
- i think it's some kind of foreign influence, but i don't know who
  they are or how "they" are organized.
- but they are screwing with the structure of society. they are
  removing people from positions of influence. they are restricting
  free speech. they are isolating people who are threats. they are
  ruining families. they are assaulting religion (or they tried to in
  2014!) they are disempowering individuals.
  - THIS IS PART OF A CONCERTED STRATEGY.
    - these are traditional bolshevik-type tactics

### i don't know who these people are, but you should be afraid.

  - because by the time you realize what's going on, america will be
    on its knees and essentially in bondage.
    - they aren't afraid to abuse the national security apparatus to
      push people around or rob them of their income and their sense
      of community.
      - those people who do misuse this: why don't they attack islamic
        radicalism? that's a really good question!
  - the people fighting for these changes think it will work out for
    them. but when america loses, all americans lose.
  - if our economy ceases to function, we cannot collect taxes to pay
    for the services that the left values so much. that we all value.
  - if there is some other significant problem that constrains
    american influence or power, again, it's going to be tough for all
    americans. all americans will lose!

### ALL THREATS => FOREIGN **AND** DOMESTIC

- these people, whoever they are, whether they are foreign or
  domestic: they are using dangerous, divisive, subversive tactics and
  they just basically do not care. they are amoral. they do not care
  whether they need to threaten your family. they might say they'll
  stand up for you. they do not respect God and they'd rather America
  be a Godless nation.
  - but, as we've all read before, once they taken everyone else away,
    who'll be left to stand up for you?!
  - if you stand idly by and watch our country's influence and
    prestige erode away, truly who will be left to stand up for you?
  - we absolutely cannot let this happen.

### HOW ARE WE **AS AMERICANS** LETTING THIS HAPPEN?!!
