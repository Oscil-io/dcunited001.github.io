## Philosophy of Censorship

the development of philosophy (and knowledge in general) is greatly
hindered by censorship.
- when a nation blocks access to ideas or restricts dialogue on
  specific ideas or prevents people from learning and developing,
  every citizen in that nation suffers because their intellectual
  development as a culture stagnates.

#### there are cultures that seem to blacklist specific ideas.

  - this includes Russia in the 2000's (I think) and it even includes
    America, to some extent. America has always suppressed a few,
    specific ideas. Obscenity was a big deal in the 60's, for example.
  - this isn't so bad, in itself. it really depends on how it's used,
    but one could argue there are some ideas that must be censored.

#### there are other countries which whitelist ideas

  - they "encourage" that ideas to be the only things you think
  about. their leaders espouse some cult of personality. nearly
  everything else outside that is restricted. not on merit, but on the
  principle that other ideas might provide competition for the state's
  mindshare, the marketshare of thought and discourse!!
  - this should scare the !@#$ out of you, by the way
  - some nations will outlaw religion, for example. Christianity, in
    particular, because they are SCARED of a KING WHO CANNOT BE
    KILLED! they cringe in fear when they realize that their populace
    might hold them to the standard of a man who died 2,000 years ago!
    some of these people claim he doesn't even exist! but for someone
    who doesn't exist, Christ sure exerts a lot of power over us.
  - we need this in society. our leaders need to fear being held up to
    a higher standard. they cannot be granted the ability to make or
    break rules and laws on whims. they cannot be allowed to decide
    what's ethical or moral today, just to change it again next week.
- regardless of what you think about religion or God or the flying
  spaghetti monster, you should beware the militant atheist who would
  deny the right to God for everyone. in general, beware the person
  who would force you to believe that every path except the one they
  follow is wrong. this is much different than those who try to
  convince you that their path is the only right path.

### how do we develop new ideas?

- to distinguish b/w an idea that is truly "new" and those that are
  not, we have to compare it to everything we know.
  - an individual can compare ideas to those he/she knows or to those
    that are available to his society or to those available to some
    group/subgroup
  - if a person is comparing an idea to those he knows individually,
    he needs to be familiar with each idea to discern how similar each
    is. if the idea in consideration is new, then it will be highly
    dissimilar with most or all of those ideas.
  - if the person is trying to expand the set of ideas available to a
    group, like his community or his country or the world
    - then they need to be familiar with not just the set of ideas
      available to themselves, but also to the world.
    - this means the person must be fairly knowledgeable, all around
- so therefore, by whitelisting appropriate ideas or blacklisting more
  than just a few, a society does themselves a grave disservice.
  - they prevent themselves from expanding to new ideas.
  - when some ideas are difficult to talk about or think about, it
    becomes difficult or *impossible* to reach other conclusions.

### the transmission and retention of ideas is a transgenerational concept

  - all you have to do to make everyone forget an idea, person,
    place or thing is make people stop talking about it for 2 to 3
    generations.
  - even if it does not disappear completely, it will lose power or
    relevance.
  - there are people who know this and they specifically seek to
    suppress ideas long enough for them to disappear. to do so, you
    must do it silently. you must convince people they should not talk
    about specific things or think about them or share them with other
    people.
    - if you can reduce people's thought or speech on a topic for a
    few generations, you can almost remove it from the noosphere.
- ... more here?

### someone is pulling some serious fuckery in this country

- and it starts with censorship. the dialogue is stifled. we can't
  talk about things. why not? who said we don't have free speech? WHO
  THE !@#$ SAID THAT? Did we pass a law about that? Is there a law
  that says you can't write bad philosophy? Or that if you do, people
  aren't allowed to read it? WHAT THE !@#$????
- i think it's some kind of foreign influence, but i don't know who
  they are or how "they" are organized.
- but they are screwing with the structure of society. they are
  removing people from positions of influence. they are restricting
  free speech. they are isolating people who are threats. they are
  ruining families. they are assaulting religion (or they tried to in
  2014!) they are disempowering individuals.
  - THIS IS PART OF A CONCERTED STRATEGY.
    - these are traditional bolshevik-type tactics

### i don't know who these people are, but you should be afraid.

  - because by the time you realize what's going on, america will be
    on its knees and essentially in bondage.
    - they aren't afraid to abuse the national security apparatus to
      push people around or rob them of their income and their sense
      of community.
      - those people who do misuse this: why don't they attack islamic
        radicalism? that's a really good question!
  - the people fighting for these changes think it will work out for
    them. but when america loses, all americans lose.
  - if our economy ceases to function, we cannot collect taxes to pay
    for the services that the left values so much. that we all value.
  - if there is some other significant problem that constrains
    american influence or power, again, it's going to be tough for all
    americans. all americans will lose!

### ALL THREATS => FOREIGN **AND** DOMESTIC

- these people, whoever they are, whether they are foreign or
  domestic: they are using dangerous, divisive, subversive tactics and
  they just basically do not care. they are amoral. they do not care
  whether they need to threaten your family. they might say they'll
  stand up for you. they do not respect God and they'd rather America
  be a Godless nation.
  - but, as we've all read before, once they taken everyone else away,
    who'll be left to stand up for you?!
  - if you stand idly by and watch our country's influence and
    prestige erode away, truly who will be left to stand up for you?
  - we absolutely cannot let this happen.

### HOW ARE WE **AS AMERICANS** LETTING THIS HAPPEN?!!



=============

facebook censorship:

unsubscribing has implicit negative feedback on newsfeed algorithms:
- not only do you hide that person from your view, but the lack of
  interaction encourages

if people are encouraged to unsubscribe on a political basis
- that can create isolated communities of people
- and bc of the feedback effect from unsubscribing
  - this isolation is more pronounced
  - then there's another feedback effect where because social circle
    of people that are isolated online, then it narrows the set of
    information those people are exposed to
    - this, when combined with clustering algorithms that facebook
      would use to determine the "kinds" of people that are interested
      in various categories of things, then this would lead to
      significant distortion in what people see
    - so that leads to further effects
- most of this is made much worse by unsubscribing


it seems that every fresh channel that i use gets OK feedback,
sometimes they'll get an incredibly response
- then, every time after that, I get such a mediocre response

there's no real way to get around this censorship
- you can register accounts with new email addresses
  - but then your new accounts have no



What makes me sick is that the left is stifling debate in academia and
in the media, putting politics in gridlock. The left mostly controls
Silicon Valley, though they are fairly impartial with regard to
technological implementation. However, nearly all of the communication
out there has shifted towards social media and online messaging
platforms. So if you get censored for some reason, that's kind of a
big deal.

The algorithms used for this are susceptible to passive and active
attacks/manipulation. When the NSA surveils, that's passive. If the
NSA were to subvert Facebook servers to alter Newsfeed rankings,
that's active. If DHS were to subtly encourage massive unsubscribes
from a person (somehow), that's passive because it's not coming from
within the Facebook application. Among other factors, when anyone
unsubscribes from you, this contributes to a feedback effect within
Facebook algorithms. This drives isolated subnetworks of users on
facebook, partially cut off from the Graph by political
differences. If anyone encourages systemic unsubscribes (E.G. for
political reasons!) then this contributes to those same feedback
effects that further !@#$ with the Facebook newsfeed algorithms!!!

I cannot emphasize this enough, but these could have MASSIVE
implications for the American economy, but it doesn't seem the left
really even gives a shit! And it really feels like censorship out
there!! Like political censorship. It's like we have our own Iron
Curtain over America, but it's more like a Silicon Blanket. And almost
all communication is via online interaction now. If you're censored
online, you're just wasting your time basically. If you were at a
party and everyone you talked to walked away from you, you'd probably
change your behavior, but with online interactions, YOU CAN'T SEE THAT
HAPPENING. So you continue wasting your time...

===========

exactly. also, your true value in social media comes from the unique
content you post/create. or at least, if you identify a story earlier
than others, that should be reflected in your reputation in the
newsfeed algorithms...

the dems are exploiting web applications and their algorithms to
project an intended appearance and to isolate/divide americans. these
algorithms already have their own weaknesses that encourage clusters
of users to become more clustered. they already have those weaknesses,
as they are. but these weaknesses can be abused to increase that
effect.

===========

because facebook and twitter newsfeed algorithms are perceived to be
"fair" the presentation of trends in social media is perceived to be
more authentic.
- i really don't believe that the average american understands how SEO
  and social media strategies work.
  - so unless the average american is leaping to conclusions as to how
    to control the presentation of information and trends on social
    media, then they are more likely to trust it more
    - it's a bit like the difference in publicity and advertising with
      regard to authenticity and trust
- if we were more aware of how to manipulate these things, then we'd
  be more cynical about what we see. it's easy to cause articles,
  topics and events to trend.
  - similarly, it's fairly simple to distract from an issue that just
    recently began trending online.
    - you basically try to trend other things and crowd it out
    - we are seeing so much of this happen!
  - this is all *passive* interference with technology and social
    media, by the way.
    - this is all possible without interfering with the operation of
      web applications!
      - if one was to actively interfere with web application, using
        the NSA for example, then it'd be fairly easy for technology
        companies to identify this behavior *and they would be
        pissed!*
    - doing this in almost any capacity is incredibly irresponsible
      and shows total disregard for the American economy!
      - it irreversibly damages the world's trust in American
        technology products, which is WHY I don't think it would
        happen.
      - if someone in power did this:
        - without taking the utmost care
        - or having the most dire need to do so
          - in no more than a handful of cases!
        - then that shows a reckless disregard for the American
          economy! this person or this group does not give a shit
          about America. At this point, technology, software and
          hardware are some of the few things that the American
          economy actually does have. And this is why I don't think
          it's going on, actually....
    - to make it clear, actively interfering with the operation of web
      applications is not the same thing as passive surveillance.  or
      even *passive* techniques to manipulate social media and/or SEO
      -- these imply utilizing the system in the same way as normal
      users would.
      - more active interference would require specific knowledge of a
        web application's design and codebase.  and I'm just going to
        leave it at that.
