- restructure:
  - introduce with hackpack,
  - mention startup
  - and segway to how wearables and success of portable IoT is determined by several factors

describe how technology startups are interdependent
- this synergy can be harvested to fuel growth
- or if some of these factors are ignored,
  - they can consumer adoption of some tech trends to the point
  - where some trends ultimately fail, that would have otherwise succeeded
- also mention VR

mention that the viability and risk of some 'higher-level' tech trends
- are largely dependent on the aggregate effect
  - of other lower level technologies, trends, platforms and frameworks.
- observing the interdependencies of these frameworks
  - can lead one to make much wiser investment decisions
- i terms of profit and portfolio optimization,
  - understanding how these interdependent influences affect each other

energy density:
- one of these major factors affecting nearly every segment of the technology industries
- it is VERY VERY unlikely that there will be a major major revolution here for some time
  - as in at least one decade, but possibly several decades
  
while it's possible that someone may introduce a creative solution
- that completely circumvents the needüí© for energy density in portable devices
  - it is VERY VERY unlikely that there will be a major innovation in raw energy storage

- two examples of creative solutions would be:
  - Tesla's oft misunderstood wireless transimission of digital data and power
    - i didn't say wireless transmission, did I
  - 


- i'm not saying that someone won't introduce a creative solution 
  - that
  












Furthermore, I have experienced the pain points your product seeks to
ameliorate since 2011 at least, when I purchased my first Tylt battery
pack. It was amazing to have an extra charge with me, but the product
just didn‚Äôt seem to work very well. In 2013, I purchased a HyperJuice
battery pack, as it had the highest Ah available at 15Ah. I still had
problems though, as now i had one more thing to charge and carry with
me. So I literally put a small power strip in my backpack. I wired up
several USB cords and even my laptop charger, so all I‚Äôd ever have to
do is plug one thing in and everything would charge.

I had just developed the prototype for a hardware product. The
HackPack: a backpack with a Li-ion battery pack, but didn‚Äôt have the
time or knowledge of materials to get it done. I also wanted this
product to have a spine that would allow you to rack up small 3D
printed modules that would encase raspberry pi‚Äôs or other small
computing devices. The idea was to start with the battery powered
backpack and gradually develop a wearable platform to power and carry
my own personal network with me. My lofty goal was to be able to hike
into [almost] the middle of nowhere and work remotely on a 4G
connection, while camping like some kind of hacker ascetic.

I had been hacking around Denver with my ‚Äúprototype‚Äù for a few months,
looking like the VR hacker from the Lain anime series, when I heard a
guy pitch the Tylt Energi backbpack at Hack4Colorado. It was kind of a
relief because I realized I could just buy one, instead of exerting so
much effort building what would definitely be a low-profit, niche
product. And so I did. The Tylt Energi was great, though it wasn‚Äôt big
enough to handle all my power adapters, which, in reality, was a major
benefit.

My point is that I‚Äôm very passionate about the problem your product
seeks to solve. It‚Äôs a problem that is going to limit demand for
wearables and stagnate consumer adoption! I was also ahead of the
curve on wearables and owned a Wimm smartwatch in late 2011. The
product turned out to be a bummer precisely because it wouldn‚Äôt stay
charged for longer than 18 hours.

People want wearables and tech products to simplify their lives. If
upkeep of these devices leads to more complexity than is offset by the
product, it‚Äôs going to stifle consumer adoption. Furthermore, if you
have wearables configured to work together, then when one of them
loses charge, the configuration of each of your other devices needs to
adapt to work without it. If your phone, the hub device, fails then
you‚Äôre screwed and now these devices are dead weight. Suddenly,
wearables become about as cool as SegaCD.

Judging from intuition and industry trends, energy density for small
devices is absolutely not going to be revolutionized in the next
decade. Battery life limits hardware adoption, leads to negative
consumer attitudes, and limits the degree of ubiquity of high level
apps built on this framework. If these apps and hardware aren‚Äôt
reliable, this significantly limits the value derived from
consumers. That is, reliable in the sense that configuring and/or
using the services provided by these devices ideally should not
require any conscious effort. And especially, these services should
ideally never require the consumer to consciously assess whether the
state of their devices or the networked configuration of their devices
limits the services they provide. If everyday your customer needs to
consciously think about whether that wearable will still have battery
life in 4 hours and the myriad of ways in which that will affect how
they function that day, they will drop usage of wearables every single
time. I experienced this in late 2011 with the Wimm smartwatch. You
don‚Äôt want to think about how it works. You just want it to work.

The battery life problem threatens consumer adoption of wearables and
it‚Äôs a defining factor of risk for higher-level ventures built on the
fabric of portable tech devices, like gear used for AR. It‚Äôs one of
several problems that needs to be addressed in emerging tech. I‚Äôm
intrigued to learn more about how you‚Äôre designing the Doblet platform
to mitigate this problem for people. Very few people are so passionate
about tech that they‚Äôre willing to lug around a backpack with a
rechargable Li-ion battery. I‚Äôm also interesting in hearing more about
how you‚Äôre structuring the business model.
