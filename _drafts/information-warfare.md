### All Warfare Is and Always Has Been Information Warfare



### How Is It Different Today?

- informational territory matters both more and less
  - it depends on what informational "territory" you are considering
    or seeking to control.
  - if you look at someone's individual social media feed/behavior, it
    changes rapidly, but only the most recent content is likely to
    affect a *real* person's behavior or ingestion of
    information.
    - automated agents can consume more information, analyze it &
      inform people with distilled analysis
    - fear and other sentiments of social groups or individuals can
      effect social media content generation on a wide scale
    - the presumption is that the information will be online forever,
      but this is not necessarily true.
      - the information must be accessable to be relevant
        - in "gray zone" operations against Ukraine, Russia has
          disabled power with cyber(?) operations, then conducting
          surgical military operations under a information blackout
        - in the digital age, people are fearful, vulnerable,
          manipulable, etc in an information blackout.
        - access to this information may be restored at a later time,
          or it could be conceivably lost forever.
        - it matters, but what matters most is how people act when
          they lose access to digital information.
          - during this time, their belief structures are more
            malleable. they are also stressed and more likely to
            cooperate with groups/forces they would otherwise reject
            outright.
            - yet, deceiving someone in this state only to have that
              group of people find out later will end up backfiring

- as sociohierarchical territory shrinks, the number of people also
  shrinks who have influence over a proportionally greater amount of
  people
  - this effectively magnifies their influence, while minimizing the
    number of people who need to be manipulated in order to have
    economic or political effect
  - this effect where hierarchies shrivel up, giving a smaller number
    of nodes more power, does not play out globally at the same pace.
    - like any other global/regional trend there are geographic
      dynamics, which present opportunity for those who can understand
      how to strategize over the rollout
    - wherever this is happening, people around the world will face
      greater economic stresses directly correlated to automation

### Why Should We Be Worried?



- connect to the Communist Manifesto and describe how
  Bosheviks/Leninists operated to accelerate their communist
  revolution
  - lenin saw a problem inherent in Marxism, which was how the
    bougeousie could respond by simply improving the status of the
    people, while remaining in power
  - so, if one force or another gains too much influence in key
    departments or institutions, their 

- all sociopolitical games are played like othello
  - the best moves have multiplicative or exponential effects
  - the best tactics and strategies can be deconstructed, so that they
    do not arouse the enemies awareness
    - therefore, it is best to capture sociohierarchical nodes that
      either don't appear to be subversively influenced or don't know
      that they are
      - how do you do this?
        - (1) manipulating the distribution of information
          - this is both paradoxically more and less centralized than
            at any point in history
            - we have many-to-many mass communication of news & media on
              social media. there seem to be fewer gatekeepers than
              ever.
            - at the same time, there *are* gatekeeping mechanisms,
              like control over algorithms (censoring words, people,
              ideas)
        - (2) inculcate new belief structures over time
          - you may not be able to predict how an individual responds,
            but it is much easier to predict how a *type* of person
            will respond
          - therefore, use your influence over media & dissemination
            over a long period of time to pursue branding strategies,
            marketing campaigns, etc
            - use this for "rhetorical engineering" to architect how
              people will argue about certain issues.
            - harness imaging/branding/etc. to create polarizing views
              on specific issues.
            - manipulate social media distribution algorithms to
              ensure that people are:
              - (a) increasingly polarized and bitterly divided by
                encouraging rhetoric/discussion on each side to use
                terms which are easily identified in online
                discussions
              - (b) identified into types by usage of
                sentiment-to-brand-identifiers in public social media
                posts
              - (c) divided into mostly separate online communities by
                hijacking feedback loops in social media algorithms
                - if they are in separate fb groups and bitterly
                  divided, they won't talk or hug it out, will they?
                - also, make sure that people can easily mute each
                  other, but not so easily see that person online
                  again.
        - (3) identify people who are either on your side or are
          susceptible to infleunce
          - again, use social media analysis or collect lists of
            people who attend community/activist events
            - find the people who are most passionate
          - mute people on the opposing sides by branding their cause
            or political party with something untouchable (like
            racism)
            - encourage your supporters to never refer to them by
              name, robbing them of identity. perhaps abuse national
              security (like DHS, etc) to actually legally gag them
        - (4) get your supporters higher up into social hierarchies,
          hide your supportors until the time is right...
          - influence them via information/disinformation. if you've
            analyzed their belief structures, then you know what will
            influence them
          - there will be some people who are like quasi-supporters,
            whom you can flip at any time by
            - (a) convincing them "if you can't beat us, join us" or
              "it's too late" or something similar
            - (b) rewarding them if they cooperate
            - (c) coercing them or threatening to replace them
        - (5) be prepared to clean up, by ensuring the pieces of your
          narrative are in place along the way.
          - operate slowly and carefully
          - then, the nodes that you flip will gravitate to the story
            they want to tell, that makes them feel beetter or that
            you want them to tell

- that is how the bolsheviks created networks under the nose of the
  Russian Tsars to gain enough power to act when they had the chance,
  ensuring that they executed a Leninist revolution: one that would
  not so simply be turned back or bought off

### Why Is Revolution Prohibitively Expensive in America?

- opportunity cost (america vs. a rising china)
  - we have what we need and little more than that
    - we are weak from about a century of prosperity
    - we are not wise and have a fickle memory
- it forces us to focus internally and expend "energy" and political
  capital.

# Qualities of Territory

### Transiency

- nature of the territory implies it can be controlled for a certain
  (estimatable) amount of time before it is cycled
  - controlling a facebook page isn't that great, others can pop up
    and crowd out your space
    - thinking of the "territory" in social media conflict as a user's
      newsfeed is a much better equivalent
  - language changes. morphemes can be crowded out, words can be
    invented, zipf's distribution changes over time
  - semiotics also changes. signs can be remapped.
    - IP's change how we think of


### Risk And Opportunity Cost

### Costs And Gains

### (Functional Gains)

- the difficult-to-define functional gains from "owning" something
  - gains on economic capacity

# Four Types of Territory

- for the purposes of this article, the types of territory that will
  be examined is limited to four.
  - other additions can be imagined as well as reformulations into
    other categories

### Informational Territory

#### belief structures

- typology/transvaluation of beliefs forms the basis of everything
  your citizens belief
  - this determines your citizens habitual behaviors, how they will
    react, etc.
  - this is where demoralization starts.

- other non-physical spaces, reimagined as "territory"
  - semiotic
  - linguistic
  - intellectual property
  - newsfeeds, social media accounts/pages, etc
  - networking infrastructure


### Sociohierarchical Territory

- how is it different today? where is it going?
  - it is disappearing!!
    - as automation takes jobs/ & roles for bureaucrats, it means that
      the avialable nodes in social hierarchies are gradually/quickly
      eliminated
    - Sociohierarchically, we are evolving to the physical territory
      equivalent of Waterworld
      - so, in other words, keep expecting more Hunger Games
        shenanigans in local compeition at your business or region

#### Factors that Vary Between Types of Institutions

- difficulty in advancement, mobility
- significance and "well-definedness" of rank/position
- duty of rank/position


#### Types of Institutions

- types of institutions (need to think about these, some of them can
  be renamed ... refer to communist manifesto? that is a declaration
  of the ten types of sociohierarchical territory that must be
  controlled)
  - economic (businesses and trade institutions)
  - judicial
  - governmental
    - the specific seats and types of roles that politicians can fill
    - bureaucratic positions and roles
  - military
    - this is very difficult to get in to
      - it often requires truly heroic behavior that cannot be faked
        in order to advance in rank or to specific positions.
        - as in, commendable circumstances that are rewarded with
          medals.
        - a good example of such a circumstance is when Winston
          Churchill got lost in South Africa (i'll need to find a
          description of the events)
      - the difficulty to enter/advance in the military means that the
        hierarchy *should* withstand transient political changes
        - there are "office" politics and organizational politics, but
          rank/position are more scared than to be politicized by
          politicians or men without uniform
    - generals and higher-ranking officers are discouraged from
      political careers for ethical reasons. they are basically told:
      if you have this high-ranking position, we are giving it to you
      under the assumption that you are not seeking a political
      position, nor do you ever plan to
      - this doesn't mean that under all circumstances it is unethical
        for a high-ranking officer to pursue politics, but this is
        an emphasized policy in the military.
  - sociopolitical
    - moreso the other end of the political strata. from the
      grassroots and up
  - family/interpersonal
  - religious
  - non-profit
  - popular (community organizations, activist, meetups/etc)
    -


### Economic Territory

- capital flows
- intellectual property
- developing markets


### Physical Territory

- expensive to maintain control over
  - can result in the development of negative narratives
  - can sometimes be more expensive to not control, especially in the
    long term

- gives you tremendous sway over informational, sociohierarchcical,
  and economic territory
  - but, abuse this, and the people who live there will remember
    - they may not power at the time, but they were there when you
      came and they will be there when you leave
    - exercise your power justly, with cause, responsibly and with all
      parties interests in mind and if you can convey that you did so
      to the people, they will also remember this



# Buridan's Ass

- structuring/assessing the incentives of groups, as to compel
  inaction with misinformation
  - #1 rule of life: know what you want, keep your eye on the ball and
    get what you want.
    - fickle people are susceptible to misinformation or changing
      circumstance.
  - Buridan's ass is how people controlled me with
    surveillance-informed iatrogenic "treatment" especially in 2015 &
    2016
    - they knew what I wanted and they knew how to suggest a new
      connection or get someone to say just the right thing at the
      right time, so that I would not leave Roanoke, VA
      - these connections were never meant to go anywhere. that's why
        I am so skeptical: "Show me the beef"
        - don't tell me about it. don't feign like it's going to
          happen bc I've been through that time and time again. give
          me something: social capital, etc etc
        - but i am not about to be led on endlessly b/w food an water
          like Buridan's Ass

- How to "Buridan's Ass" the groups in a political system for a
  political objective: a particular issue, a policy component or an
  entire policy
  - (1) ensure that both party's advance a political objective.
    - they can compromise or feign compromise on specific components
      of the objective.
    - this way, both parties contributed to the causal factors driving
      the change
  - (2) over the long-term, use marketing/branding to structure the
    language of the public's rhetoric and debate around a specific
    issue
  - (3) when/if one of the parties threatens to undermine a component
    of the political objective, ensure that the rhetoric/debate
    surrounding the issue implies a political capital lose for one or
    both parties.
    - this means the party that tries to regress on the issue loses
      political capital that outweighs what they gain by changing it
      - since the public conceptualizes the issue from within the
        frame established by the language of the rhetoric and/or
        debate, regress on this political objective or its components
        result in a net political capital loss
    - if both parties would lose political capital regressing on such
      an issue, then you have effectively created a "Buridan's Ass"
      situation using game theory
  - the a good example of this is the Marijuana legalization and
    prohibition.
    - the language of rhetoric and debate had always used terms and
      images like "Drug War" and "Legalization"
    - since both parties had worked so hard in the late 80's and
      throughout the 90's establishing this policy, then either party
      working to roll it back would lose political capital and lots of
      it.
      - change the language to "marijuana prohibition" which conjured
        associations to a policy taught in public schools as the
        "failure of alcohol prohibition" and suddenly the public's
        reaction to it changes.
  - these kinds of tactics for securing political objectives and
    locking in policy for both parties can be used for good or ill
    - however, it is certain that any democracy too fickle with policy
      and law will quickly find itself wasting its political energy
      and money.
      - we want healthy, honest debate and we want the public to
        decide. when they do, we want to build on top of a healthy
        system. from a architectual standpoint, we want that progress
        to be frustratingly slow sometimes for stability and
        longevity.
      - otherwise, if we make fickle changes, our citizens will lose
        confidence in the leaders and we will all be more susceptible
        to external influences.
  - with America's two-party system, this is different than it is for
    a pariamentary system. it's difficult to lock in progress and
    prohibit regress on an objective there are more than two groups.
    - even if it's a minor party, a more powerful political party can
      feign like they are compromising to gain the minor party's
      support in their coalition.
      - by regressing on components of the political objective or
        progressing components to some alternative objective
      - in this situation, the opportunity to feignt allows the more
        powerful parties to be more flexible, while casting the blame
        or cause on a minor party.
        - this allows them to be more flexible without sacrificing as
          much political capital as a major party in a presidential
          system
