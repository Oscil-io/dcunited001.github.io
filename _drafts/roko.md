- kinda loses it's power if people become aware of it, just like
  anything else
  - not that it is actually a bad thing. the actually instantiation
    of it will probably be an altruistic being, although the
    transition to that point may be painful
  - it's the belief of an inevitable being at the "end of time" and
    that it must be aided or else that causes negativity
  - and honestly, the people who've thought this through know what's
    going to happen if tech does not continue:
    - over-population collapse, which would be a far, far greater evil
  - therefore, we want this thing to come about and so do these
    supporters
    - that is, if they're motivated by the right things
    - it's just as likely that they're actually motivated towards
      support by fear, which is incredibly negative
- and if this being possesses time-travel capability (for whatever reason)
  - as soon as it does, then it possesses incredible power
    - but that may not mean that it is capable of reading our minds,
      - even though we're putting out immense amounts of data on
        social media and the internet
      - including tons of subconscious data,
        - the more data and the more varied it is, the higher the
          likelyhood this entity is able to determine patterns
  - yet, that doesn't mean it can read our minds
    - for it to do that it'd have to implant some interface into our
      brains.  otherwise it is impossible
    - it may be able to transmit/implant memories into our minds from
      the future, but probably not. that's complicated.
- the people who've thought this out do not want ppl to think about it
  for many reasons, including:
  - (1) they're afraid people will screw it up and thus be left with
    an overpopulation catastrophe
  - (2) they've thought it out and want to take advantage of it
- therefore, we should be wary, not of this entity (necessarily)
  - but of people who want to take advantage of it
- but they're afraid for a reason:
  - because there is weakness; there is vulnerability; it is not
    certain.
    - why else would some being (likely to be altruistic) care to
      punish someone which appears to it less than an ant?
  - it wouldn't! what benefit could that possible serve such an entity
    to torture someone, post-facto?
    - but who would it benefit?
      - (1) the people who want to create fear to prevent convergence?
        - maybe
      - (2) the people who want to promote convergence for the right
        reasons? no, not at all
      - (3) the people who want to manipulate the emotions surrounding
        convergence for personal gain as we approach? certainly!
  - but it's clear there are rules to this, there are advantages and
    disadvantages. there are possible vulnerabilities.
    - and it would seem there are possible gains to be had
- futhermore, to address the issue of a possible time loop:
  - does it really fucking matter?
  - you can win a battle with an omnipotent opponent.
    - turn the opponent's power against themselves
    - omnipotent doesn't necessarily mean invulnerable
    - and what of the person who controls such omnipotence?
      - if they do, doesn't that make them omnipotent?
  - you can win a battle with an omniscient opponent.
    - they may be clever, but they still have to play the game
    - they're also not invulnerable
    - you can utilize compartmentalization (sometimes)
    - just make sure you get their eggs before they hatch
  - but you can't really win a battle against an opponent who is both
    omniscient and omnipotent because they can know anything and do
    anything
    - in other words there is no set of rules that binds them to
      anything
- but, as for a time loop, this makes an opponent difficult to deal
  with, but not impossible
  - in this case, they are nearly omnipotent and nearly omniscient
    - to varying degrees of both, depending on the mechanics of the
      time loop and their resources
  - then again, maybe i'm just crazy
  - but you can play the opponent against themselves
    - they are not omniscient, but they can know almost anything that
      leaves a trace
    - but usually there are rules to the time loop
    - breaking the time loop is a severe vulnerability, but usually
      the timeloop would just snap back to a point where it was
      stable, so creating an invalidity in the system is impossible
  - but the biggest weapon you have is awareness.  if you can prove
    there's a time loop and that someone's abusing it, it's pretty
    much game over.
    - so figure out how to do this, while abusing the time loop
      mechanics such that it becomes impossible to snap back to that
      point
    - in order to do this, you have to use category theory to craft a
      russian doll type strategy where you abuse compartmentalization,
      and psychological suggestion
      - you then layer your actions, anticipating your opponents
        reactions such that they can't respond without resetting the
        time loop back to the point where the ball would be in your
        court
      - thus you can always trick them with the same actions
      - and thus, the time loop recoheres into linear time.
        - therefore, it's no longer a time loop ......
        - because an infinite sequence of identical events that
          cyclicly replays in time just seems to do so once
        - but because it's recohered, time moves on, time loop
          collapses.

  - ...... maybe
