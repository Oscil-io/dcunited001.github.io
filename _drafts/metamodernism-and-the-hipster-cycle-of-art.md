i'm an aesthitician (lulz)

retro-modernism as an artistic movement that counters postmodernism
and the completion of modernism ... or maybe it could be...
- but the idea is that there's these art pieces and artforms out there that stayed
  beneath the radar.
  - that because "the best artists fly under the radar" the best art
    may have gone unnoticed.
  - it seems the evolution of art has remained strictly controlled,
    especially in the past 2 centuries.
    - the reason is: art expands how we think and the most popular art
      forms the edge of things we think about. so if you control
      what's in art and media, you kinda control how people think, in
      a way.
    - it takes an ungodly amount of money and influence to control
      this kind of stuff. art and truth have a tendency to slip out.
  - but this explains some things, like the fact that Van Gogh was
    mostly undiscovered until after his death.
- and so, there should be a lot of art and music out there waiting to
  be discovered

### the best artists fly under the radar

the best artists fly under the radar!! they have to shield their true
understanding of the world around them because they can be serious
threats to those in power! those who have considerable influence (the
level of influence and money required to prune and shape art) are
constantly trying to identify these people. if you get identified as
someone who's a threat to these people, they don't play nice. YOU WILL
NOT KNOW WHAT HIT YOU.

- so the best artists have the technical capability to hide their true
  vision.
  - they have the acuity to develop a vision in the first place
  - and some of these people may have understood that, to truly push
    out their ideas, they may have needed to hide them in plain sight,
    within their work.
    - therefore, they must also understand how to encode these kinds
      of symbols and messages.
  - and, most of all, the person capable of those things above, they
    are usually capable of success. fame & fortune will tempt them. it
    tempted me, but i had experienced so much pain in my life, i
    wasn't willing to allow myself to be "nerfed" or bought out.
    - I SUFFERED FOR TRUTH. I DIDN'T SUFFER TO BECOME A MOCKERY OF THE
      THINGS I SUFFERED FOR!
  - ... anyways, these artists, the one's you're looking for, they
    have to have the ability to obtain fame/fortune, but look past
    it.

quite simply, the best artists value the truth and authenticity of
their art more than anything else in the world!

### technical prowess of artists compared to popularity

this is just some observations on music and art that led to some
interesting insights. some music and art/artforms needs to stay
underground. even if it wasn't made for mainstream appeal, it "loses"
something if it becomes mainstream. or risks losing some truth or
aspect of itself, if it extends beyond a circle of people who truly
understand it.

- music which can only be fully enjoyed by those with the right
  headphones is less marketable. there are lots of songs out there,
  for which you can only truly experience what the artist intended if
  you have a high quality headphones
  - this makes it inherently less marketable
  - yet, at the same time, more artistic. if you're an artist and
    you're making music with this in mind, then by embracing your
    artform (creative, hard-to-pick-up music production techniques),
    then you have to accept that you're probably not going to be
    successful, since it's less marketable.

### The best artists must choose b/w success and art

- in other words, sometimes the more proficient artists
  necessarily must choose between success and art.
  - therefore (& quite often) mainstream success is at odds with
    artistic expression. this doesn't mean that mainstream artists
    aren't good artists.
- however, this implies that, over the 20th and 21st century, there
  should be plenty of artists or artforms which completely avoided
  mainstream notice.
  - artforms based on transient technology should be especially
    interesting. that is those artforms based on tech that was only
    around for a few years or perhaps in some alternate universe

### Felling on Deaf Ears

- (recap) there are so many audio engineering techniques that would be lost on
  those not listening with a critical ear.
  - to the same point, there are many creative techniques that enrich
    audio or visual art that are totally lost to most, except
    trained/experienced critics
- therefore, in terms of becoming popular or achieving mainstream
  success, none of those techniques are going to help you sell art,
  but they require more effort: orders of magnitude more work
  - and truly, the best artists produce work that's like an
    onion. every time you experience you peel away what turns out to
    be the surface of some amazing new layer you hadn't imagined
- and so, the best art is necessarily underground and there's a group
  of "hipster" critics who pride themselves on understanding those
  sensory delicacies most often lost.
  - these critics share their tastes with their friends and as they
    do, that art grows slightly in popularity.
    - and so does the general appreciation of what makes that art
      "good" that can be recognized by listeners/people
    - the selection of underground artforms & symbols recognized by
      someone forms a kind of map that can speak volumes on who they
      are. (esotericism) this applies especially when they are unaware
      of the significance of some symbols

### Hipsters Drink from the Wellsprings of Art & Culture

- anyways, when critics recognize underground art for some
  minor qualities the remain missed by others, and then spread that
  art & appreciation of its qualities to others, this forms a kind of
  cycle.
  - there's a wellspring of creativity at the center, surrounded by
    hipsters and master artists.
    - these "wellspring" have an intense effect on the evolution of
      art. again, the evolution of art and music is an incredbily
      powerful thing to control or influence.
    - there are unseen forces that guard these wellsprings of
      creativity, art and culture. to either control them for profit
      or to protect them from tainted influence or ....
- and from these wellsprings, artistic influence gradually spreads
  outward to the mainstream consumers whos capacity 4
  recognizing/appreciating "good" art expands.
  - to truly appreciate art, one needs to capacity to understand and
    they need to activate it.
  - the significance/meaning of art is often encoded into the art in
    such a way whereby the significance of symbols related to the
    production of the art is important to understanding the true
    meaning of it.
    - this is because artists are most familiar with their tools.
    - since these are the languages of symbols they understand most,
      they provide the semiotic basis of "second language" for that
      artist
    - therefore, it's crucial to understand the production of art and
      the techniques involved if you hope to understand an artist's
      work

### On Art, Knowledge and Directive Cognitive Expansion

- (see article "Directive Cognitive Expansion")
  - (also, see "Consciousness is a Continuum" article)
    - this briefly discusses the importance of semiotics in expanding
      consciousness and developing our ability to abstract ideas
  - so, if the degree of consciousness is measured by the expanse of
    symbols a being can communicate with, both recgonizing and using,
    and the degree to which they can express themselves and the
    subtlety of situations...
    - then it should stand to reason that our most learned citizens
      are the most conscious and the best artists must be those of us
      who are highly educated and retain a varied expanse of
      experiences.
