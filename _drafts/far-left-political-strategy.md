subversive long-term political strategy of the left:
- push conservatives out of their jobs, especially those that are
  vocal or tend to make political contributions
- shutter small businesses, forcing those businesses owners to
  encounter financial problems.  small business owners are typically
  conservatives bc why the fuck would they not be?
  - that makes small business owners less likely to make conservative
    political contributions
  - additionally, this exacerbates economic woes in america
    - the upper middle class shrinks
    - the middle class shrinks
  - but the best part (for the left) is that means that the evil
    corporations further dominate the economy, gobbling up the market
    share of closed small businesses
    - this means it's game with fewer players
      - those players will push for policies that will motivate the
        base on the left
    - in an economy where most of the former middle class moves to
      lower economic status, more and more people sympathize with the
      policies on the left
- small businesses and the middle class need to be protected
  - if a government agency inserts toxic people into a small business
    or exerts leverage over an employee of a small business to spread
    toxicity and/or negatively affect their operations (i.e liaison
    officers or people whom liaison officers exert leverage over)
    - small businesses, specifically, are going to be less equipped to
      respond.
      - they have smaller budgets, fewer resources, often lacking an
        HR department or fair & equally applied policies
    - this just means that, even if the government is targeting all
      businesses (small, medium and large) equally, then small
      businesses are more prone to being negatively affected
- my main point is OMFG if HomeSec is doing this kind of shit, i want
  to vomit!! for so many reasons:
  - the biggest of which is that: the economy and stability in the
    economy (even at a micro scale - just looking at individual small
    businesses) is a major, major factor in HomeSec
    - in other words, politically oriented manipulation of this agency
      runs completely counter to its goals!!
  - and especially if that manipulation results in action in
    congress or by the american people!! since there are legitimate
    reasons for this agency, if the american people need to stand up
    to it because a political force is abusing it, then taking
    (well-justified!!) action against such shenenigans results in a
    less secure america
    - THANKS OBAMA

how/why the left encourages transition to socialism
- socialism only works as long as an economy functions and as long as
  the government has money for such services
  - as soon as there's no money or there's significant economic
    turbulence, then you have an angry population who lacks any
    understanding as to why they can't:
    - buy food or participate in the economy or go to school
    - even have schools... yada yada
- so, by encouraging policies which exacerbate long-term problems, the
  left is basically damning america,
  - while motivating large populations of lower class people to clamor
  for those same policies,
  - which they aren't educated enough to understand the long term
    costs of those policies

we're in an economic situation today that's different than any other
in history,
- where game theory and our current & destination economic state
  - economic state as in aggregation/allocation of resources & intellectual property
  - this means we're inevitably headed towards a world where resources
    will be increasingly allocated to a smaller group of people
- it's nearly inevitable, that is.
  - we have to understand how to dismantle the conditions that create
    poverty, so citizens in the lower class can have access to
    opportunities that can change their lives
    - the free community college, IMO, is a great example of a policy
      which can be life-changing for those who might not have very
      many options.
      - it doesn't cost much and won't leave the people who fail with
        the burden of student loans
      - in spite of the fact that such a policy goes against my
        conservative views that government services should be limited
        - in this case, it gives people who are talented enough or who
          work hard enough to change their lives, if basically, they
          just work hard enough

why we don't want a revolutionary change in political/economic power
- because many of the reasons why modern society has not collapsed and
  why western society was able to develop to the point that it has can
  be DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED to many of the policies that the left rails
  against and uses to motivate their base.
  - therefore, these policies are necessarily bad or motivated with
    an intent of greed or power, regardless of the pain some of these
    policies have inflicted on lower classes
  - many of these policies and tactics were instead motivated with a
    desire to retain stability
    - and most importantly TO RETAIN THE CAPACITY OF OUR SOCIETY TO
    CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ENOUGH TECH TO AVOID AN OVERPOPULATION
    CATASTROPHE
- because revolutions (especially if there is warfare involved) can
  lead to a situation where someone comes to power who is ill-equiped
  with the experience to lead with adequate long-term vision
  - they simply lack the experience (developed over the course of
    generations) that enables the wisdom required to rule and to
    promote/retain stability
  - exemplia gratia: the french revolution and resulting jacobinist
    chaos
    - the "reign of terror"
      - [Antoine Lavoisier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier),
        the "father of modern chemistry" was executed
    - lots of turmoil after the French Revolution, leading to the rise
      of Napolean, a dictator gaining momentum on the promise of a
      return to French prominence (.... nevermind)
      - corsica (cheech and chong)
