if tobacco were a completely unregulated industry with no quality controls, would that be better? so there's this really effective medicene for nausea, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. and you're saying it's good that this medicene is produced with no quality controls. 

have you ever made brownies? (no) do you have any experience with using marijuana? (no) so why are you pretending be "smart on marijuana?" obviously, that is a separate organization, but the truth is - you don't know what you're talking about and just like Reefer Madness in the 30's, you will say anything it takes to keep marijuana illegal, regardless of whether it can be proven that safer, more effective prevention policies can be implemented. 

it doesn't matter that decriminalization leads to more widespread research and better informed policy. you don't care. 

also, given the current system, it is **not economically viable** for people to choose to eat marijuana. you do know that i would much prefer to **eat** marijuana, right? it doesn't have as great psychological effects. do you know that it costs about $100 minimum for a private individual to make edible marijuana. the same smoked dosage costs about $20. in a regulated system, this is not the case. instead cannabis users can more easily choose to not smoke. 

if you truly cared about people's health, you would not pursue these policies. for mental health, it's better when people are not afraid of going to jail. they are more likely to seek treatment -- when they have a problem. when prohibition is in full force, it is mostly the people who are caught end up in treatment. it becomes harder for family to intervene or for family to be aware of a problem at all, since criminalized drug users seek to hide their use.

drug referral statistics are skewed by drug warriors, who seek to control the intake questionnaires and other aspects of treatment process. they do so to inflate the numbers to justify their policy. and thus, they are meaningless.

referrals for court-mandated treatment for me ended up in exposing me to hard drugs for the first time. great policy, huh...

it's great that people are debating this. because for the longest time, prohibitionists ran from debates (though some still do)
