Dear Hiring Manager,

Regarding NBC's recent News Technology Software opening, I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to projects driving smart, actionable data on elections.  I understand what sparks the interest of your consumers and I'm creative enough to build apps to drive just that.  I'm a polyglot programmer with experience in a myriad of technologies. I love the versatility of functional programming and my favorite language is Clojure, which I've used to implement bioinformatics algorithms. 

I'm not just a web application developer who's worked with a dozen languages, including Ruby, Javascript and Clojure.  Earlier in my career, I worked with VOIP, Business Intelligence for Call Centers, and Cisco networking gear.  Last year, I developed a reporting application in Ruby that aggregated data from multiple MySQL databases for Rails applications.  The solution I provided enabled us to quickly provide reporting to the Hispanic Scholarship Foundation across all their apps.  This allowed HSF to identify top performing students and student leaders and because of the agile design of the reports, we were able to quickly respond to change requests.  These reports were cached in MongoDB, so that individual metrics could be tracked over time.

I'm not just limited to internet technology.  I'm an audiophile who understands A/V hardware and though I don't have industry experience here, I'm a very fast learner when presented with challenges.  In the past few months, I have been working on an app called Voxxel where people can impersonate quotes from movies and TV.  Then my machine learning algorithm scores their quotes, so they can improve their impressions.  I'm worried that intellectual property will prevent me from launching the app, but I've learned a ton about digital audio processing. 

I've been passionate about startups for years and I understand how information drives business decisions.  Getting the right information to the right people is crucial.  Thus, the following are critical: both building the processes to distill data to produce this high-level info and being capable of responding quickly to demands driven by the election.  Agile response to dynamic conditions driven by the election translates into higher quality information to your viewers.  The ubiquity of information today creates an increasingly competitve atmosphere for news organizations.  So at least two factors strengthen competitive advantage here.  First, the speed at which information can be processed and delivered gives you an edge over your competitors.  And second, the simplicity of the form in which it's delivered allows your customers to quickly digest it.

I'll provide you some links to my work in my application, as well as some my "Best of" LiveCoding moments, where I was building my own iOS 3D graphics engine.  While I'm not an expert in 3D graphics, the library I'm working on allows for some amazing user new experiences, especially with VR.

I'm currently located in Roanoke, VA, but I'm available to move to New York in a few weeks.  I'd like to schedule a time for a phone interview and I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. 

Thanks for your time,
David Conner
