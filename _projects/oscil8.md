excerpt: Oscil8 was an audio discovery engine, but went through several pivots since its original inception in late 2011.  It was a place where producers could publish new sounds and samples they're working on.  Aspiring musicians could follow their favorite producers to understand how they produce their unique sound and could collaborate with other musicians.  In future iterations, Oscil8 would have used AI to help artists develop new sounds for both software and hardware instruments.  In late 2011, I originally imagined Oscil8 as a Github for musicians well before others understood the future demand for this.  As that market was claimed, I pivoted, but never had the positioning I needed to work on the project for more than a few months.

Oscil8 was an audio discovery engine, but went through several pivots
since its original inception in late 2011.  Here's an
[article](/posts/2015-04-01-oh-i-have-this-stellar-startup-idea-worth-millions-just-kidding-april-fools.html)
describing the business model in detail.  It was a place where
producers could publish new sounds and samples they're working on.
Aspiring musicians could follow their favorite producers to understand
how they produce their unique sound and could collaborate with other
musicians.  For an overview of what Oscil8 was, I've described it in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi18MTvq-28).

### Cloud Based Synthesizers

Musicians would post a sample or sample pack, along with the files
used to create the samples.  Intelligent algorithms would be able to
parse the files and reconstruct the sounds with cloud-based
synthesizers.  Yes, both software **and hardware** synthesizers,
racked up in the cloud.  As a further source of monetization,
musicians could rent time on expensive, hard to obtain synths.  With
enough data, machine learning algorithms would begin to produce sounds
or suggest parameter tweaks.

### AI Assisted Synthesizers

In future iterations, Oscil8 would have used AI to help artists
develop new sounds for both software and hardware instruments.  What
kind of algorithms am I talking about?  I describe them in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAXKiZ5QQHw).  AFAIK,
nothing like "Google Deep Dream for Audio" exists yet.  It's too bad I
don't have the opportunity to pursue this stuff.

### Oscil8's Origins

In late 2011, I originally imagined Oscil8 as a Github for musicians
well before others understood the future demand for this.  As that
market was claimed, I pivoted, but never had the positioning I needed
to work on the project for more than a few months.  For some reason, I
could never find a cofounder who believed in me, but I was a bit too
tight lipped on the features, for obvious reasons, which proved to be
a fatal mistake.  This was simply too good of an idea to let go.

In 2013, Splice.com was developed and became the Github for musicians.
Today, I would estimate it's value at $100 million, at least, given
it's investments from Seed and Series A ...  $100 million dollars.
Tiesto is an investor!  The most popular and highest paid DJ in the
world is an investor.  This is really what I was interested in.  It
wasn't the money at all.  It was the chance to provide a revolutionary
platform that democratized music production.

But do I get any credit for having a good idea?  No. Instead, I found
myself ignored while I had an opportunity to develop this, then
laughed at after the fact for thinking having the idea should matter
at all. And I get it, it sounds bad to whine about this stuff.  But
come on, this was the chance to revolutionize an artform.
