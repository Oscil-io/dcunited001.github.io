### 3D Graphics with Metal

Spectra is a 3D Graphics Library for iOS, written in Swift.  It's
based on the new Metal framework, which opens the door for new
possibilities!  Spectra is focused on utilizing the functional facets
of the Swift language to enable vibrant new graphical programming
techniques.  Dependency Injection maximizes simplicity.  Render
pipelines can be constructed dynamically.  Nodes in the Scene Graph
can be flexibly interweaved.  Geometry and Compute Shaders are at the
forefront.

Note: the current Spectra repository is a rewrite of this
[older repo](http://github.com/dcunited001/SpectraNu), which has more
information about what I was hoping to achieve with the project.
However, neither are very functional at the moment.  This project's on
hold, as I get distracted with some other work.
