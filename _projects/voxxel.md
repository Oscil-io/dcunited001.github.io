Voxxel is an app that scores accents and impressions of soundbytes
from movies and TV. It includes an AngularJS frontend, including
spectrogram animations built with HTML Canvas, D3 and WebAudio. An iOS
prototype was built with Swift. An android prototype was also
developed.

At the moment, the Angular frontend is no longer online.  It was built
with Divshot, which was purchased by google.  I need to redeploy the
frontend on Heroku, as I ever-so unfortunately have no money.  Only
broken dreams and broken apps.  The app infrastructure was based on
the [Appistack hackathon template](/projects/appistack.html), which I
also developed.
