excerpt: Yup. I open sourced my brain. Here it is. If you're on OSX, you'll need to download OsiriX if you really want to view these images. Just import the folder as a new DICOM database. There are several online applications available to view the data. If you are techno wizard, you can also use python's nipy and dipy to manipulate the data.
