# Ye Olde WebGL Canvas with ThreeJS

This is my first post on 3D graphics with WebGL & Three.js. I set up a
section of my blog with an interactive template, so I can easily
create more of these.  This demo was ripped out of the Three.js
examples by the way. It's slightly modified to move the camera in the
z-axis according to the mouse's distance from the center of the
browswer window. I need to figure out how to read touch input for
mobile browsers, but for now

### Social Mechanics

I hope to use these to demonstrate what I've been learning with
math. I'm excited to work on social mechanics and social physics and
doing so requires a bit of brownian motion and eigenfunctions.  I
independently stumbled upon this once I realized I could create a
particle shader that *proves* many of the depressing social mechanics
that get under my skin. I could do so visually in a way that's much
more difficult to argue with and feign ignorance. It's similar to
statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics. I hope to implement this
stuff using compute shaders and textures in WebGL.

### It's All About The Gigarands, Baby

My next task is to create a few random number generators and write to
textures with them. I'm going to use a simple Linear Congruential
Method, but with UI and controls to modulate the parameters. I may
also include multiple types of random generators. My first approach to
a GPU PRNG was to intuitively mimic the Wallace Transform. At least, I
think that's the approach I was taking. I downloaded a bunch of GPU
PRNG papers. It's not anything like the Merseinne prime twister. It's
quite a bit more complicated than LCM and LFSR. IMO, that's impressive
for someone who doesn't have a college degree.

### Porting Code from [Spectra](/projects/spectra.html)

Also, I've written some geometry code in Swift with Metal for Spectra,
so I hope to port some of that to WebGL, since it's a bit hard to
demonstrate in XCode. With the Three.js compute shader code, I can
port my lattice generation code to WebGL.  One project I want to work
on is a 3D version of Conway's Game of Life using a 3D lattice and
computing state changes with compute shaders.

### So yeh ... I should probably have a job LMAO
