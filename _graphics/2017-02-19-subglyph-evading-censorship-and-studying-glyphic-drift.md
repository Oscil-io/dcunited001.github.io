Subglyph is basically a substitution cipher, with a twist: it's based
on homoglyphic similarity and allows one to copy and paste text that
is legible by human and unindexible by computers. The ideas behind the
as-yet-incomplete machine learning component of Subglyph could be used
to measure linguistic and glyphic "drift" whereby one could study the
components of written languages and the ways in which they drifted
across regions.

As society gravitates towards virtualized communication tools, the
closer we get to 100% of surveillable, indexable conversations. The
difference between a surveillable conversation and an indexable
converstaion is that indexing is cheap and can be automated, whereas
surveilling conversations requires human intelligence.

So, no, Subglyph is not a tool one would hope to use for perfect
secrecy, but one that provides a mask from indexing to prevent
automated newsfeed-based censorship. That is, if enough people used
it. Otherwise, it becomes filterable in its similarity to spammy
emails.

So far, Subglyph is a simple hand-coded dictionary, with between 5 and
15 possible subsitutions per Latin alphanumeric character. The genius
is that it's about 50 lines of code that could change online
communication if an idea like it took off. It requires momentum to
create the "mask" against indexing. Sure, there is the "zomg
terrorists could use this" argument, *but that is ludicrous*: have you
ever read a spam email? OK, now calm your alarmism down a notch.

If one wanted to save their religious texts from deletion from the
Internet Archive, they could use Subglyph to encode them before
overlaying them on meme images and, finally, storing them on the
archive. This ensures that the problem of data discovery is
sufficiently hard.

### Machine Learning to Produce Custom Homoglyphic Unicode Dictionaries

That's just the start. The second, more complicated portion of
Subglyph is about training a machine learning algorithm to produce
custom dictionaries. As this training component of subglyph gets
closer to completion, updates will be made to this page with a
graphical interface for visualizing the training process.
