describe math behind poplocking
- combinating sets of joints in human (and other bodies)
  - as balls/neighborhood for the enumeration of set pairs for
    isolation
  - "hilbert space"-like concepts for application/optimization of
    movement functions across
  - a universalizeable method for how the human mind can "score" the
    motion and correlation of motion in poplocking movement functions
    applied to pairs of isolation, applied to maximize score by
    observing the gradient of the optimal selected "hilbert space" for
    the isolation pairing
    - this "hilbert space" might not actually be a hilbert space. i'm
      probably confusing it for something else (draw a picture?)
    - how this universalizeable scoring method for perceiving
      poplocking motions is also related to
      driving/coordinating/choosing
      - that is there are overlapping domains for domain-types (types:
        scoring/driving/choosing)
    - so because these structures overlap, there is an AI notion of
      ping-ponging with the function applications of domains &
      domain-type structures (for domain types [A & B: (A), (A,B),
      (A,B,A2), (A,B,A2,B2)]
      - so the person driving the motions is utilizing generalized
        polynomial expansions across the combinatorial enumerated
        domains [A & B: (A), (A,B), (A,B,A2), (A,B,A2,B2)]
      - if the person perceiving is engaging their brain as attuned
        with experience, then they are running similar algorithms to
        optimize with [A & B: (B), (B,A), (B, A, B1)]
        - i.e. this translates into a mathematic modeling of: what i
          think, what i think you think, what i think you think i
          think

- and, for both functions A (driving motions/behaviors) and
  B (scoring/analyzing motions/behaviors):
  - what's happening here is that there is some metaphysical solution
    that the brain is trying to emulate by finding an analytical
    solution
    - the analytical solution can be mapped to some structure of
      neurons. the structure of neurons would not usually map
      one-to-one with the structure of the analytical solution
      - the analytical sol'n may not map one to one with the numerical
        sol'n, but it rarely may.
      - i know that the numerical sol'n for some problems is not
        modelable for some problems. in order to solve the problem
        with incomplete knowledge of the parameters (i.e. in some
        useful way)
        - then an analytical sol'n is required and solutions are not
          necessarily/ordinarily/usually exact, especially if the
          solution requires learning weights to the problem

- an inefficiancy arises when the human mind must relearn patterns of
  motion (or some abstract behavior/expression)
  - this is bc the mind is finding the structure for some analytical
    solution (ALL of which [sometimes] for a problem are combinatorial
    enumerable using binomials or combinatorials, at least to some
    degree of polynomial)
  - when it settles on a non-ideal solution to the problem or does not
    use a polynomial-expansion to describe values of weights, or the
    physical neural network representing that analytical solution is
    damaged, then the mind must repair itself by transforming the
    neural network from (A <- (B -> C))
    - where it's trying to simply go from (B -> A), but because it
      must transform its existing structure, it cannot
    - it instead must try to find some (B -> C), where C is the
      closest approximate solution to A from B
      
- ... maybe transition to something else... lulz

- connection to negative occupational therapy
  - how this explains why it's expensive to unlearn
  - why negative OT & cognitive behavioral therapy will systemically
    burden our population with unnecessary complexes
  - unlearning these anxieties, conditioned behaviors, neuroses and
    conditions is incredibly expensive for the brain & mind
    - especially when they are systemic in the person's psychology
      (i.e. the person's mind is overly dependent on or suffers as a
      whole because of these unnecessary, intended problems)
  - when a negative effect is intended through CBT and Occupational
    Therapy, it means the people designing these "treatments" are
    trying to maximize the negative effects and thus, trying to
    maximize the extent to which a persons mind/behavior becomes
    dependent on suggestion
- who the fuck pays for this shit when it goes horribly wrong? who
  does that benefit? why would someone want this for america if it
  redirects(WASTES) the wealth we generate from GDP


* thoughts on algorithms for poplocking both humans and non-human
  jointed objects,
* generalizations to AI & psychology,
* how negatively-intended cognitive behavior therapy unnecessarily:
  burdens our society and benefits liberals who are using it for
  harassment and mind control.

  energy.
  - when and how does the aesthetic of the minimization of energy
    present itself in a fighting style?
