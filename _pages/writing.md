Everything I'm writing at the moment is like a draft. I'm creating a
body of work I can rework into multiple books. Mostly non-fiction, but
with some great ideas for fiction, including a fairy tale and fable
about a princess and a mage.

There's also a story about an alchemist who makes a momentus
discovery, but flees an overzealous, draconian government into the
depths of an ancient city, which becomes a metaphor for a spiritual
transformation. He makes the horrible realization that, by discovering
and relevating a true spiritual transformation that rivals competing
faiths, he has broken an ancient seal restraining the materialization
of demonic transplanar entities.

### Yes! I'm Looking For an Editor

When I write those books, particularly the non-fiction. I'm hoping to
involve an editor the entire time. So yes, I'm looking for someone
who'd like to edit my work. Most of the valid negative feedback I've
received deals with style, form, and a lack of illustrations or
diagrams.

# [On Criticism](#on-criticism)

I love getting feedback on my writing, especially negative feedback,
since it implies an opportunity for quick improvement. I value
negative criticism much more than positive criticism, but I will
disregard criticism when it's invalid. If the source of criticism
doesn't clearly articulate their reasoning, this can occasionally be a
test to see if I would be capable of filling in the blank. However,
more often than not, if the criticism is a majority ad hominem, with
little to no references to my ideas or arguments, it's baseless and
invalid at best.

<a name="you-are-your-own--most-valuable-asset" />

### [You Are Your Own Most Valuable Asset](#you-are-your-own--most-valuable-asset)

I love hearing what everyone has to say, but I constantly encounter
people who want to throw me off with their criticisms. If you ever
really get somewhere in life, you will find that you have to
understand what defines you, what defines your work and how your work
is an expression of yourself. You are your most valuable asset. Your
definition of yourself and your creative expression: *that is what you
have as an artist.*

Your confidence conveys that. You will get shit tests all the time and
people will specifically test you on exactly that: your confidence and
your resolve towards the expression of your artistic integrity. If you
don't understand that or if you let any bozo tell you who you are,
what your work means, or why you should change it, then you just don't
got it. Take every piece of advice with a healthy dose of skepticism
because people likely don't know you or your work, but they know
confidence.

<a name="why-is-novelty-so-often-rejected" />

### [Why Is Novelty So Often Rejected?](#why-is-novelty-so-often-rejected)

In fact, if you truly have something new, they won't understand it,
but they'll understand how you react to it and how strongly you defend
your artistic direction.  Further, a true artist doesn't define his
work for you. If s/he does, their art probably lacks depth. Almost any
work acquires depth through mystery and most attempts by artists to
clarify or define their work will flatten it. So, truly, if your work
pushes boundaries or it's captivating, *people won't understand it!*
**In fact, for aestheticians and art critics, the degree to which your
work defies comprehension by various audiences is a measure of your
work's value!** Especially when it inspires fascination.

The truly mysterious is what we lust after. There are so many people
in my life who publicly criticize my writing by deriding it as lacking
sense, coherence, structure, sources or adherence to typical academic
language. I'm so glad these people are fucking idiots because they are
proving that my work has value and these people would never do me any
real favors. Please! Fucking clueless and let's keep it that way!

<a name="criticisms-on-lack-of-sources" />

### [Criticisms on Lack of Sources](#criticisms-on-lack-of-sources)

The one criticism I hear most is a lack of sources! That's not so bad,
compared to what people could criticize, and they are all points which
I fully understand. And honestly ... an autodydact with no sources?!
... Again, you're doing me favors. It's original content.

For some articles, that's unacceptable. But again, I'm not an
academic. Criticizing me for lack of sources? It's basically some tool
too sharp for his/her own good asking me to do something they very
well know burdens me with more time investment than the average
academic. I'm writing posts about dozens of different fields without
university education. That academic experience I don't have? The
pragmatic value is the understanding required to navigate the
groundbreaking studies in your major or subject of expertise. Not only
do I have nearly zero familiarity with the de facto, highly-cited
papers in any single field, I'm often combining one to four fields.

Ain't nobody got time for that! That's where most of the work happens
when you write a 10,000-40,000 word master's thesis. I'm not writing a
thesis. I'm writing fucking blogs. I have about 100,000 words on deck
and 300,000 words worth of content in vague outlines, with just as
much on post-it notes.

<a name="distributed-intellectual-property-attack" />

### [Distributed Intellectual Property Attack](#distributed-intellectual-property-attack)

Speaking of post-it notes, I'm also in the middle of a distributed
intellectual property attack, which has been going on for several
years. Essentially, I realized: ain't nobody gonna let David Conner
win not nothin'! I mean c'mon! LOL ... And so, instead of sitting on a
mound of ideas lusting over my first entrepreneurship win, I'm just
going to write about all of this and forget about profiting.  I've
never wanted money itself. I only wanted currency for influence.
Including this disclaimer sounds lofty, but I only want to only
release IP that is positive and beneficial.

I've found that my true power all along is by connecting the right
people with the right people and ideas. I found that, while I may
never amount to anything myself, I am perfectly content acheiving
nothing and knowing that I've planted the the right seeds in the right
places.

# &#x16DD; [Oneiroism](#oneiroism) &#x16DD;

When people no longer need to work and when computers are more capable
of creation than people, the Singularity will threaten to destroy the
incentivization structure that motivates people towards action. This
kind of techno-nihilism could end up being corrosive.

To help counter this, I've been thinking about putting together a kind
of quasi-religion.  It's called oneiroism from the wordstem *oneiro*,
which implies dreaming. Perhaps I specify that Oneirism is something
more along the lines of philosophy in practice than a religion.
Another idea would be for augmented self-improvement through
cognition, as I've outlined in my
[Directive Cognitive Expansion](/posts/2015-08-26-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-three.html)
article. The idea there is to empower people by training them to use
their minds through art, science and meditation.

I'm a bit afraid what I write might be taken too seriously, but I
think humanity needs to return to myth to connect with our roots and
that through myth and through codified practices, we can inspire
people to strive for self-improvement in the face of nihilism.

One idea for a practice is geared towards the need to protect
individuality and find a way to stand up against nihilism. The episaga
is aimed at addressing both. Everyone would have their version of a
particular story which would be a meditation on something like Love or
Justice or Heroism. [American Eros](#american-eros) is the first such
story.

By maintaining a personal version through their life or collaborating
with others on their version of a particular story, they are
developing their ability to recognize/utilize/strengthen those traits
in themselves and others. Furthermore, it represents individuality for
the sake of individuality as we approach the end of individuality.
Individuality can provide us with drive and purpose. This can help us
stand up against nihilism.

I don’t see anyone else talking about an idea like the episaga. There
are similar concepts, but this is specifically targeted towards
addressing philosophical problems in the near-future. I know there are
authors out there with whom this would really catch on.

### [If I Had the Chops to Write My Daedalian Magnum Corpus](/posts/2016-06-23-if-i-had-the-chops-to-write-my-daedalian-magnum-corpus.html)

If you had asked me at age nineteen to pick a career path I'd never
explore, I would have immediately and emphatically answered with
"Writer." Recent exigent events seemed to have altered the course of
my destiny. Such unquestionable axioms of reality suddenly reek of
fallibility, e.g. "DC would never, under any circumstance, ever
become a writer. You can count on that like the sun coming up."
Apparently this is no longer true.

In exploring the possibility of being a writer, I decided to explore
and articulate my own writing process. I wrote an article about it. As
a writer, it seems it'd be useful in finding an editor. The first
thing I'd want to communicate to an editor is how I think about
writing. I've enumerated the other elements of the writing process as
Theme, Form, Plot, Characters and Style. As themes are the most
important aspect of writing, IMO, I created a list of hundreds of
themes, which I'll include in part two of Daedalian Magnum
Corpus. Themes are the ideas behind your work that you want your
readers to explore. Themes are why your work would be interesting or
why they'd inspire discussion. There are tons of good stories and
intriguing characters, but themes are where your work connects with
the human condition.

And I wanted to empower people who’d want to write … I guess? My heads
getting a bit big here LOL. I wanted to describe my own writing
process, for my own purposes as a writer. So I ended up writing
this. And I think it's useful reading for anyone who wants to tell a
story. If you're making a video game or writing a screen play or just
writing a journal, this article is useful.

### [American Eros: Or How to Fell a Souley](/posts/2016-07-07-american-eros-or-how-to-fell-a-souley.html)

American Eros is first a short-story about love at first sight,
without sight. It's also a pitch for a revolutionary new concept that
I'm calling an *episaga*, which is an open source myth. The idea is to
tell a story describing how main characters were led to develop
exactly what they needed in order to have that perfect love experience
the next morning, when they least expected it.

Yes, there have been open source and collaborative books before, but
this is a new age reworking of myth and I hope to inspire others to
return to the true human storytelling tradition. The distinguishing
idea of the episaga is that storytellers will keep several fixpoints
mostly constant, and these include a handful of plot-points,
characters, themes, etc. The fewer and the more general, the better!
Storytellers can fork off of other versions of the myth or
collaborate. The self-imposed restrictions help foster creativity.

To explain further here are several invariant plot points --
*fixpoints* -- which should mostly stay the same. And other people
would contribute towards them. The fixpoints should be as generic as
possible and there should only be a handful. Ideally, for plotpoints,
just one or two, to conserve types of variation in form.

### [Oneironautics: Questing for Lucidity](/posts/2016-05-14-oneironautics-questing-for-lucidity.html)

I occasionally have the most vivid dreams. Oneironautics is a series
where I describe some of my dreams. These are the ones where you wake
up and you just have to write them down. If you're looking for a laugh
or something to freak you out a bit, then by all means, take a peek at
my subconscious. The first in the series covers several dreams: one
includes a Colombian drug lord and power tools and another includes a
journey into the recesses of my mind, presented as a metaphor whereby
I unlock some knowledge hidden away.  And perhaps for my own good...

<a name="facets-of-greatness" />

# &#x16DD; [Facets of Greatness](#facets-of-greatness) &#x16DD;

This is a series on Leadership. Think of people like Steve Jobs, Elon
Musk, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. What about local
community leaders that you find motivating and inspiring? What is it
that sparks leaders great and small to begin work on projects that
seem monumental or impossible or hopeless? Why do they strive onwards
where everyone else gives up? Why do they find success when others
might work harder?

For leaders like Ghandi, IMO, he gained an opportunity because his
non-violent tactics countered traditional resistance to social
change. And his tactics and protests, perhaps by chance or by genius,
built a movement. Ghandi was a master of social networking before
Facebook or Twitter.  Either he was very lucky and capitalized on his
chance or he was a genius at networking through people. How could a
fairly soft-spoken man like Ghandi inspire people throughout India at
a time when the telecommunication system was still being developed
there?

What makes these people different? What are those subtle aspects of
their craft that have thus far eluded us? There must be something that
makes these people different in a way. What do they know that the rest
of us are missing out on? Would the world be a better place if many of
these ideas were common knowledge? Yes, with the exception of some
ideas, I think it would be a much better place. I wholeheartedly
believe that a world full of empowered, knowledgable, wise people
would certainly be a more peaceful world.

### [The Nature of Space, Time and Information Implies Universal Language](/posts/2016-04-12-the-nature-of-space-time-and-information-implies-universal-language.html)

This post pitches possibility of some language which constructed to
mirror the kernel or apex of the structure of knowledge. It is built
from the most basic structures of information. The thesis for this one
is: the need to communicate & establish protocols without having to
cross vast distances implies that every sufficiently advanced
civilization would eventually uncover an identical language to
communicate ideas, given enough time and development.

This is one of the articles for which I received significant backlash…
from my family, who knows nothing about philosophy. I sat on the
outline for months. The morning I was going to publish it (a few hours
before) they sat me down and threatened to send me to the looney
bin. And that’s basically my life. I’m lucky if I don’t get sent off
for “treatment.” The way they approached handling me that day was
reactive to my writing. Weird, right? My mom, brother and sister each
refuse to read anything that I write. That’s so weird. They claim that
it sounds crazy, I’m crazy and that I should just get a job.

This article establishes the basis for a universal language.
“Consciousness as a Continuum” establishes the possibility of a
pre-existing medium through which we can all communicate
instantly. Through the entire universe! Or at least, I entertain this
idea. This has VAST implications for EPISTEMOLOGY and TECHNOLOGY!! I
haven’t really heard anyone discuss this! So, how can someone say this
isn’t philosophy and that it belongs on a futurism subreddit?! That’s
fucking crazy!

### [Consciousness as a Continuum: Life, the Cosmos and You](/posts/2016-07-12-consciousness-as-a-continuum-life-the-cosmos-and-you.html)

This article undermines the Singularity by posing the possibility of
threshold at which all civilizations in the universe will become
capable of instant communication with all others. Thus, instant
transmission of data & experience & knowledge to other civilizations.
Imagine a galactic economy, where your value is established by the
supply of computational power you can contributed to this cosmic
quantum supercomputer to the sky!

This article generated controversy on Reddit's Philosophy channel,
though moderators quickly removed it. Users in other subreddits and a
few not-very-supportive readers critiqued my work as rambling, but
didn't actually demostrate knowledge of the content. This further
demonstrates their lack of familiarity with my subject matter in
general! *THANK YOU!* You just proved my content was
novel!

Regardless, this piece's "rambling" nature is proof of genius: I didn’t
have an outline; no one told me about this idea; I sat down one
afternoon and just wrote until I published it.

### [Neural Networks and Spider Brains](/posts/2015-11-21-neural-networks-and-spider-brains.html)

This is an article about consciousness that ties into **Consciousness
as a Continuum** and **The Nature of Space, Time and Information Implies
Universal Language**. It covers how a spider processes sensory
information via insights its neural networks must make. This piece
covers the lower levels of consciousness and more completely describes
what I call the window of consciousness in later essays. These lower
level neural networks drive insights which are provided to that window
of consciousness, which the spider uses to drive its actions and
behaviors.

When I thought to draft these ideas, I was procrastinating saw a
spider on the wall. And so I frantically typed up an outline. This is
my Newton's Apple, if I have one. As I watched and interacted, I
realized that, at some level, it must be capable of recognizing
objects, types of objects, actions and types of actions in order to
“inform” it’s actions. These capabilities imply that its neural
networks must embody some structure which permits these
capabilities. This post requires understanding of consciousness,
neurology, machine learning and other esoteric fields.

But … the post could also lead to important insights for Artificial
Intelligence? I guess? I don’t know. But that right there is my
genius: I don’t fucking know! I'm caught between both a superiority
complex and an inferiority complex! Throw me a frickin' bone here! I'm
trying to establish credibility.

It's pretty funny to watch people dismantle my work, but never
actually mention any of the content. They usually go straight for the
*ad hominem*, which is the rhetorical equivalent of flinging your own
poo at someone. It stinks and now you have poo on your hands. If you
don't understand the language or whatever, that is fine. I'm more than
happy to talk to you about it and I guarentee that within five to
fifteen minutes, you will understand what it is I'm talking about,
regardless of your education level. I guess that makes me a good
teacher, too.

For that series and, in particular, for “Nature of God”, I thought
that if I bait skeptical readers into attacking me by saying that my
use of language is just smattering, then I’m free to respond by
saying: actually, for a scientist/atheist, you’re not as intelligent
as you might seem because you don’t understand A,B,C scientific idea
or mathematic process. If you claim that you don’t understand, then
you either didn’t understand those metaphors/allusions or you stopped
reading right after the beginning. Either way, it’s like rhetorical
jujitsu because some of my readers are going to respond in that manner
anyways, regardless of the merit of my work & thought.

This is a three-part series arguing for the value of religion. Part
one refutes Nietzsche’s hypothesis that “God is Dead.” It does so
using some pretty convoluted language. This was an intentional
direction in style. I wanted to use scientific imagery to appeal to
atheists and scientists in particular. I also expected these same
people to be the first to dismiss my work. No one really takes me
seriously LOL.

The notion of immediate rejection on whatever effective basis possible
is something that I am well-acquainted with. I am constantly dealing
with people who never plan on taking me serious and don't wish for my
success, ever. It would make them wrong. They value saving face more
than healthy progress for myself. I never get the chance to make a
first impression. And so! I have learned to take this into account.
Specifically, I often present people with openings to attack me on the
assumption that they will (and they do) so when they attack me, they
so it on my terms! It's a learned defense mechanism in a world of
constant criticism.

It's so bad, I have an analogy for my life that involves the
statistical method of linear regression, where you are optimizing a
function.  The general idea is that you've got a ball rolling down a
hill and you want it to roll in such a way that optimizes some cost
function. At each step, you're picking variables that allow the ball
to roll down the hill to a more efficient solution.

Well, in terms of my most common social interaction, in both the
short-term and long-term, it seems that people around my are trying to
micro-manage things like number of social connections, impact,
credibility, appearance, and context, such that the ball rolls down
the hill in a disadvantageous manner. It seems like they are well
aware of psychological methods, but that they are using them to make
things harder for me. In other words, their cost function is not
optimized on my success, BUT ON MY FAILURE! Both in the short-term and
long-term!

That sounds fucking crazy! But when, given hundreds of decision
points, when I gauge the impact and intention behind their actions
and, most crucially, the alternative available words/actions, it
becomes clear: this person or this group does not care about me. Over
the course of hundreds of interactions, it becomes clear: they always
go with what is negative for me, especially in the long term.

# &#x16DD; [Epistemology](#epistemology) &#x16DD;

The metaphysical structure representing the sum of all human knowledge
greatly exceeds the computational capacity of the universe, implying
that the universe can never observe in totality the knowledge
contained within it.

This is an unfinished series on the mind and its connections to the
nature of knowledge and cognition. These articles tie together of
neurology, psychology, cognition, metacognition, philosophy, category
theory (math) and epistemology. By combining knowledge from
developmental, behavioral and cognitive psychology, we enable
ourselves to learn about how we learn. With this, we accelerate our
development to learn better, faster, harder …

This post uses an incorrect set of terms for describing epistemology,
but that’s because I basically I'm not using the usual epistemology
language. The first part is an intro. The second part discusses
specific elements of our mind. It states that our brain is modular and
our mind is powered by dynamically combining these modular
elements. It then asserts that if we develop/improve some of these
modular elements through some specific skill or hobby that those
improvements should carry over to other skills that rely on any of
those elements. Part three briefly enumerates some of the
skills/hobbies that work best for this. It describes how and why these
skills help our mind function more proficiently.

Eventually I will write part four and five, which provide a model for
knowledge that’s based on category theory. Some people at Stanford
have already written about this, so it’s not new, but it is powerful.

These two articles cover social and cultural problems that will take
root as technology evolves more rapidly. These are most definitely
philosophical questions and I would argue that understanding
philosophical problems could never be more important than at the
current moment. Paradox of Creativity was the first article I posted
on [/r/philosophy](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy)

Figuring out how to stave off nihilism and the death of individuality
is our Riddle of the Sphinx. The roots of almost all 21st century
social & cultural problems will be partially composed of nihilism or
the death of individuality. Those two concepts will cripple and
demoralize us at a time in history when we MUST remain as strong as we
could possibly be.

### [Paradox of Creativity](/posts/2016-05-16-the-paradox-of-creativity.html)

I posted the “Paradox of Creativity” in early June. It was my first
post on reddit. It was deleted in six hours, but had already
accumulated 2,500 sessions and 50 comments! My first post on reddit!!
IN SIX HOURS!!

That is validation. It doesn’t matter what you say or whether you
blessings allow me an opportunity to have my writing critiqued. My
writing has been validated by the simple fact that thousands of people
visited my site in six hours. When I saw that number, I thought there
must be something wrong! NOPE!
