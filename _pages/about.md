I once started a self-portrait in highschool, with oil paints. I never
finished.

### The Measure of a Good Man
{: center}

The measure of a good man is what he decides to do when a friend needs
help, whether his friend asks directly or not. When it's not his
problem and especially when he'll incur significant retribution for
helping his friend or especially a stranger! Even moreso when it's a
stranger!

### Integrity: I Have It, Almost to a Fault
{: center}

When someone cares more about about truth, justice, compassion,
equity, integrity and virtue than their own life? That's a good
person! This is what you should look for in man! Reward their ability
to make personal sacrifice for justice, love and truth!

And, off-topic, that's what makes military and police good people in
general. This is why, even though I've found myself arrested and
singled out for drug charges, I can't look at an officer or a soldier
without respect. It's because I know that ninety-nine times out of a
hundred, or really more than that, the person wearing that uniform is
willing to risk their life. The reason they do is because they care so
much about the kinds of things people should care about, that they are
willing to risk their life for it.

### How to become great at anything
{: center}

Find your weakness, practice and make it a strength. Find what's
difficult and make it effortless. Make it everything you do, your soul
focus, and you will be great. Don't stop to settle for what feels
great, don't let others convince you that you're already great and rob
you of your desire to practice. Examine yourself from others' points
of view.  What do they find great and what weaknesses do they see?
Don't forget to give back to those around you and empower your friends
because they'll be invaluable later on.  But most of all make sure
that you have fun excelling, because otherwise being great doesn't
mean much at all.
