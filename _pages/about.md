I once started a self-portrait in highschool, with oil paints. I never
finished.

### How to become great at anything
{: center}

Find your weakness, practice and make it a strength. Find what's
difficult and make it effortless. Make it everything you do, your soul
focus, and you will be great. Don't stop to settle for what feels
great, don't let others convince you that you're already great and rob
you of your desire to practice. Examine yourself from others' points
of view.  What do they find great and what weaknesses do they see?
Don't forget to give back to those around you and empower your friends
because they'll be invaluable later on.  But most of all make sure
that you have fun excelling, because otherwise being great doesn't
mean much at all.
