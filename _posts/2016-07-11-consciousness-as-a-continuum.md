Philosophers have debated on the nature of consciousness for
ages. What is it that allows us to think? As Descartes said:

> I think, therefore I am.

Is this true? If so, what makes us conscious and not animals? Is there
some fundamental difference between us?  I believe that consciousness
is a continuum that extends to some degree across all walks of
life. Consciousness is our window to the world. It's how we experience
the information that we experience.

### Consciousness is a Continuum

This window can be shallow in that it is just the experience of the
information with very little processed aggregate information available
on top of it. Or this window can have much more depth to it, in which
case it would include lots of aggregate data. Eventually, this window
becomes complex enough that it gives rise to complex thought.

Particularly after vocal cords are developed that can be controlled to
differentiate a large number of phonemes in a reproducible
manner. When this is combined with the mental prowess for basic
abstract thought and (social features), then something special happens
in the minds of animals.

Once the knowledge for making these phonemes (types of sounds) is
fairly common, so that it's almost inevitable for the children of that
species to make those sounds, then it can be expected that nearly
every member of a species will experiement with combinations of those
sounds. Once that happens, then it can be expected that there will be
a transfer of information between members of the same specices, simply
because:

#### They have the physical ability to make the same kinds of sounds.

#### Most members of the species will make those sounds.

#### The species has some level of sociality.

#### And, therefore, the species will share common experiences.

So there will be a transfer of information between members of the same
species, given that they can make similar sounds. These sounds are
attached to meanings in the world, which requires ideas from
[semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics). Early on, it's
difficult to ascribe any particular meaning to "words" in these kinds
of languages. There's no structure and nothing is maintained. So,
early on, these phonemes take on meanings that are implicit to the
animals experience and because they all have similar experiences,
those meanings can be implicitly conveyed to other members of the
species without having to communicate any specific meaning. Similar to
slang, the particular words and meanings will rise and wane in
usage. These phonemes can be combined to form morphemes and,
eventually, grammars should emerge.

It's hard to say this is language because there isn't any way to
specify meanings for anything. But it is communication. And it sets
the stage for abstraction and variation and combination of other
faculties of the brain, which lays the groundwork for higher level
thought.  And we all gradually evolve towards embodying minds which
are capable of discovering what are universal ideas.

### Language Expands Consciousness

Language expands our consciousness. It's what enables abstract thought
for many reasons. If a species does not have the capacity to produce a
large number of phonemes, then it will probably not develop higher
consciousness. In order to develop that, a species needs that kind of
challenge in it's environment; something that provides value if the
animals can master it; something that forces their minds to abstract
and to variated combinations of symbols and functions.

There is very little else in an early intelligent life form that would
be both useful enough and allow them to play around with
variations. They need some kind of social structure because those
social activities require them to abstract their actions, behaviors
and routines. Social structure also forces them to develop a stronger
concept of both self and group.

- introduce some things: link these ideas together
  - need a thesis

- why do i need to talk about entropy
  - both cosmic entropy and informational entropy

- why do i need to talk about quantum entanglement

- mention the Neural Networks and Spider Brains article

## Entropy

entropy in cosmology/thermodynamics

a logarithmic measure of the rate of transfer of information in a
particular message or language.
- entropy in information theory is derived from the amount of
  possible variations in an encoded message.
  - so in the context of physics and especially biology,
    - informational entropy plays a role in determining the types and
      rates of interactions that could occur between particles
    - as if the intersection of two particles is a kind of
      informational exchange
  - ... i think. i haven't really thought this out. it seems like a
    parallel could be identified here...

In the grand scheme of things, cosmic entropy is its own
anti-thesis. Or ... we should hope that it is. Entropy is EVIL!! lulz

Our ability to counter entropy and our capacity to dominate it
determines our cosmic fate. We have to do so ethically of course, but
observing the universe's state, it appears there's not much out there
doing so on a grand scale. Such
[Type II/III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale)
Civilizations would show up as abberations violating natural entropy
in cosmology. Intelligent life *could* account for *some* of Dark
Matter's variation, but I just don't know enough about astrology &
cosmology. That's right, intelligent life should show up as
statistical error in our models of the universe.

Our ability to increase the computational capacity of the universe
determines our ability to augment our window of consciousness into the
universe. More computational power translates into the power to solve
bigger problems. More importantly, it translates into the ability to
virtualize larger and larger worlds, if for some reason other worlds
are not accessible in another means. This extends from what I've
written in
[I'm Not Religious, I'm Spiritual (Part One)](/posts/2016-06-01-im-not-religious-im-spiritual-1-God-is-not-dead.html)
and
[Nature of God](http://localhost:4000/posts/2016-05-31-the-nature-of-god.html).

Entropy determines the fate of the universe. If there's a Big Crunch,
we can deal with that a lot easier than a Big Freeze. There must
certainly be one or the other, I think. With increasing vastness of
space, it will require more energy to reorganize it for
computation. That's depressing. Depending on the inherent
computational potential of matter, we can create powerful computers
with the matter/energy available to us. But if we're surrounded by a
cosmic desert, we can't build massive computers. And that limits our
ability to expand into virtual universes that descend from ours.

Basically, the complexity of a universe that can be reasonably
simulated by intelligent life depends on this computational density
and our ability to assemble pieces of such a massive computer.

# The Connectedness of All Things

Spooky action at a distance. That's how Einstein referred to quantum
entanglement of particles. It transcends the speed of light.
Entanglement shares some interesting properties with my favorite
subject: category theory. And in particular, there are lots of
interesting overlaps with functional programming.

Basically, two particles emerge from some interaction entangled. And
now their state is tied together with the chance of lazy reevaluation
of state in the future. That is the future state of both particles is
tied to the result of the interaction in the past *and* to future
interactions. So, any future interaction to either particle has to
account for state changes to the other particle in the entangled pair.

## Interconnected and Everconnected

Lets think all the way back to the Big Bang. I believe it happened,
though religions might talk about things symbolicly. If you look at
Genesis, everything happens in the right order. Interesting, n'est-ce
pas? The order is preserved ... K, moving on.

If you start now and move all the way back to the Big Bang, everything
becomes more likely to be connected. Particle interactions are more
likely and, therefore, entanglements are more likely. I wish I knew
more about the exact quantum physics driving this, but it's clear that
if you go allll the way back to that original singularity, you'll find
that *everything* is connected. Therefore, everything is
interconnected and everything is everconnected. Forever....

#### The Universe, Basically... lulz

![The Universe, as the Overly Attached Girlfriend You Probably Never Dated](/img/posts/2016-07-11-consciousness-as-a-continuum/gf-forever.jpg)

I'm not the first person who's thought of this. Obviously .... Or
maybe I did. Who knows (I didn't)

So anyways it would seem that, if you trace things all the way back,
then throw in that lazy-evaluation perspective on quantum
entanglement, then you'd see that everything is interacting with the
*product* of everything it's every it's ever interacted with
before. So basically, the state of any particle is like a factorial
that accumulates more behavior with every subsequent spatial
interaction... I think.

I donno. I need to know more. But I suck up the math like a
sponge. Seriously. I just need to be around more people that think
about this stuff.

## The Quantum Web

So, if these ideas hold to some degree, then there should be a
*Quantum Web* that forms between all particles that have ever
interacted. And because there were so many more interactions at the
beginning, then nearly every particle should already be entangled with
all others, to some degree. I don't know how long entanglement really
persists though. This Quantum Web is born out of the concept of
everconnectedness I introduced above.

The degree of the history of interactions that are maintained is a
question I wish I could shout at a group of MIT freshmen. Because they
could probably tell me. And yes, I would probably shout this question
at a crowd of people at MIT.  Hey, when you want to freaking know the
answer, you want to know! *I HAVE QUESTIONS, PEOPLE!* And they are
hard! It's like going to the bathroom. Sometimes you just gotta know.

If it holds, then everything is like this Quantum Web of particles,
which is a graph where every particle's state is describable by its
product of previous interactions. The graph can be arranged in a few
ways and reoriented to help find paths/trees for one specific
particle. You could try to identify the specific particles that form
it's interactions and all the dependencies as well. Particles which
do not have quantum effects like this could be combined to form "new"
particles, which do not have such dependencies ... maybe.




life is the inevitability that entropy will push matter to self
organize into higher forms, eventually to those that have the capacity
to instantiate higher-levels of information.  life forms need to
process information. therefore, life forms internalize information
about their world in the form of self-organized matter composed of
various representations of that information, including the life forms
experience.

this sets the basis for the continuum of consciousness, which is
formed from the undeniable fact that we have a window to the
world. life processes streams of information. the very fact that we
have this experience of information means that we have consciousness,
at least some level of it. even if it's not a very big window or not a
very "significant" one, it is our window to the world. even a spider
must, on some implicit level, deal with the fact that it is
experiencing the reality of that window to the world.

as senses evolve, they provide us with a bigger window to that
world. as our brains evolved, they provide us with a better processing
that expands that same window with aggregate information at various
levels, expanding to the kind of consciousness that human beings
experience. the kind that forces us to question why? why am i here?
what is my purpose? what is my directive?

in fact, life and especially self-aware life is the universe's means
of becoming aware of itself.
