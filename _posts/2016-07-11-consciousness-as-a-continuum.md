### Consciousness is a continuum that


- introduce some things: link these ideas together
  - need a thesis

- why do i need to talk about entropy

- why do i need to talk about quantum entanglement

- mention the Neural Networks and Spider Brains article

## Entropy

entropy in cosmology/thermodynamics

a logarithmic measure of the rate of transfer of information in a
particular message or language.
- entropy in information theory is derived from the amount of
  possible variations in an encoded message.

In the grand scheme of things, cosmic entropy is its own
anti-thesis. Or ... we should hope that it is. Entropy is EVIL!! Our
ability to counter it and our capacity to dominate it determines our
cosmic fate. We have to do so ethically of course, but observing the
universe's state, it appears there's not much out there capable of
doing so on a grand scale. Such
[Type II/III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale)
Civilizations would show up as abberations violating natural entropy
in cosmology. Intelligent life *could* account for *some* of Dark
Matter's variation, but I just don't know enough about astrology &
cosmology.

Our ability to increase the computational capacity of the universe
determines our ability to augment our window of consciousness into the
universe. More computational power translates into the power to solve
bigger problems. More importantly, it translates into the ability to
virtualize larger and larger worlds, if for some reason other worlds
are not accessible in another means. This digs into some ideas I
hesitate to write about quite yet, but they extend what is discussed
in
[I'm Not Religious, I'm Spiritual (Part One)](/posts/2016-06-01-im-not-religious-im-spiritual-1-God-is-not-dead.html)
and
[Nature of God](http://localhost:4000/posts/2016-05-31-the-nature-of-god.html).

Entropy determines the fate of the universe. If there's a Big Crunch,
we can deal with that a lot easier than a Big Freeze. There must
certainly be one or the other, I think.

# The Connectedness of All Things

Spooky action at a distance. That's how Einstein referred to quantum
entanglement of particles. It transcends the speed of light.
Entanglement shares some interesting properties with my favorite
subject: category theory. And in particular, there are lots of
interesting overlaps with functional programming.

Basically, two particles emerge from some interaction entangled. And
now their state is tied together with the chance of lazy reevaluation
of state in the future. That is the future state of both particles is
tied to the result of the interaction in the past *and* to future
interactions. So, any future interaction to either particle has to
account for state changes to the other particle in the entangled pair.

## Interconnected and Everconnected

Lets think all the way back to the Big Bang. I believe it happened,
though religions might talk about things symbolicly. If you look at
Genesis, everything happens in the right order. Interesting, n'est-ce
pas? The order is preserved ... K, moving on.

If you start now and move all the way back to the Big Bang, everything
becomes more likely to be connected. Particle interactions are more
likely and, therefore, entanglements are more likely. I wish I knew
more about the exact quantum physics driving this, but it's clear that
if you go allll the way back to that original singularity, you'll find
that *everything* is connected. Therefore, everything is
interconnected and everything is everconnected. Forever....

#### The Universe, Basically... lulz

![The Universe, as the Overly Attached Girlfriend You Probably Never Dated](/img/posts/2016-07-11-consciousness-as-a-continuum/gf-forever.jpg)

I'm not the first person who's thought of this. Obviously .... Or
maybe I did. Who knows (I didn't)

So anyways it would seem that, if you trace things all the way back,
then throw in that lazy-evaluation perspective on quantum
entanglement, then you'd see that everything is interacting with the
*product* of everything it's every it's ever interacted with
before. So basically, the state of any particle is like a factorial
that accumulates more behavior with every subsequent spatial
interaction... I think.

I donno. I need to know more. But I suck up the math like a
sponge. Seriously. I just need to be around more people that think
about this stuff.

## The Quantum Web

So, if these ideas hold to some degree, then there should be a
*Quantum Web* that forms between all particles that have ever
interacted. And because there were so many more interactions at the
beginning, then nearly every particle should already be entangled with
all others, to some degree. I don't know how long entanglement really
persists though. This Quantum Web is born out of the concept of
everconnectedness I introduced above.

The degree of the history of interactions that are maintained is a
question I wish I could shout at a group of MIT freshmen. Because they
could probably tell me. And yes, I would probably shout this question
at a crowd of people at MIT.  Hey, when you want to freaking know the
answer, you want to know! *I HAVE QUESTIONS, PEOPLE!* And they are
hard! It's like going to the bathroom. Sometimes you just gotta know.

If it holds, then everything is like this Quantum Web of particles,
which is a graph where every particle's state is describable by its
product of previous interactions. The graph can be arranged in a few
ways and reoriented to help find paths/trees for one specific
particle. You could try to identify the specific particles that form
it's interactions and all the dependencies as well. Particles which
do not have quantum effects like this could be combined to form "new"
particles, which do not have such dependencies ... maybe.




life is the inevitability that entropy will push matter to self
organize into higher forms, eventually to those that have the capacity
to instantiate higher-levels of information.  life forms need to
process information. therefore, life forms internalize information
about their world in the form of self-organized matter composed of
various representations of that information, including the life forms
experience.

this sets the basis for the continuum of consciousness, which is
formed from the undeniable fact that we have a window to the
world. life processes streams of information. the very fact that we
have this experience of information means that we have consciousness,
at least some level of it. even if it's not a very big window or not a
very "significant" one, it is our window to the world. even a spider
must, on some implicit level, deal with the fact that it is
experiencing the reality of that window to the world.

as senses evolve, they provide us with a bigger window to that
world. as our brains evolved, they provide us with a better processing
that expands that same window with aggregate information at various
levels, expanding to the kind of consciousness that human beings
experience. the kind that forces us to question why? why am i here?
what is my purpose? what is my directive?

in fact, life and especially self-aware life is the universe's means
of becoming aware of itself.
