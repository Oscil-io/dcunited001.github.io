Here's a list of things that are incredibly interesting and I couldn't
live without learning. I'm hoping to learn plasma physics to get to
the point where I can hang with people doing real research and maybe
apply my creativity.  Also, I have some pretty cool ideas for
superconductivity, but I'm not sure if they're original.

## To Learn Over the Next Six Months

### Language

- Japanese
- Kanji
- Learn more about written languages (devanagari, etc)
