# The Automation Crisis

There is an economic crisis brewing. As automation drives
unemployment, governments will be forced to respond with policy:
either UBI or Employer of Last Resort. Regardless of
[the economic and sociocultural merits of UBI versus ELR](/posts/2017-06-05-international-trends-2020-universal-basic-income.html),
neither policy is sufficient to stave off unemployment's effects on
revenue streams to banks. In turn, this triggers several downstream
effects: a major slowdown in lending, major reduction in liquidity
available to banks and (...).

To cope with the economic turbulence, governments are compelled to
lend money to prop up the economy. The greater the scope of
entitlement programs, the more the currency must be diluted in
response. With numbers pulled directly out of my ass, by 2030, we
could reach 20-100% annual growth of the national debt. Imagine the
effect that would have on currency markets, economic development and
lending institutions.

The upcoming crisis is unlike any before. Even though it shares many
of the same components, it is fundamentally different in ways that
will elude many economists. I do not have the data or the expertise to
predict how this will unfold, nor does anyone. It is not necessarily
disastrous for America or the global economy, but there is significant
potential for disruption. Again, it's not necessarily worse, but the
acceleration in economic trends along with qualitative aspects of the
crisis will cause it to elude understanding.

It's critical to keep in mind that America has the status quo now. All
other powers have a greater incentive to disrupt the economic status
quo than we do in maintaining it.

### [Why Is This Crisis Different?]()

Because there isn't enough liquidity and wealth distribution for
people to keep up with their debt, it's a deflationary depression
where inflationary measures are appealing to inject liquidity into the
economy. In doing so, the finance of budget deficits via credit drives
inflation, which contributes to systemic instability in global
currency markets. But unlike most depressions, various means of
production should remain elevated through the use of
technology. Because of automation's inversion of labor markets, this
furthers income distribution disparity. The liquidity to invest in
smart-grid infrastructure and the development of emerging markets will
be restricted. Further complicating matters, nations often respond to
depressionary crises with warefare to artificially stimulate of
economic activity and facilitate expansion. This creates geopolitical
instability at the same time as global economic crisis.

The Singularity's technology trends drive the global economy to
converge towards a more final state. This crisis represents a
tumultuous transition towards economic convergence, but may spiral out
of control.

# Eight Major Factors

This is an overview of eight major factors that act as components to
the development and outcome of the crisis. These factors are not
listed in order of significance because the system is non-linear and
these factors effects, dynamics and magnitudes are thus
interdependent.

## (1) [Geoeconomic Dynamics of Automation and Unemployment](#geoeconomic-dynamics-of-automation-and-unemployment)

## (2) Policy Response: Strategy, Perception, Timing and Pacing

## (3) Commodity Markets and Resource Distribution

## (4) Technology's Impact on Commodity Markets

## (5) Distribution and Control of Foreign Direct Investment

## (6) Forex Dynamics and Foreign Currency Reserve Distribution

## (7) Distribution of Debt

## (8) Population Flux, Entitlements and Median Income

# [Geoeconomic Dynamics of Automation and Unemployment](#geoeconomic-dynamics-of-automation-and-unemployment)

- this factor drives the common person's response, their change in
  economic circumstance and their overall perception of the crisis
  - from the perspective of a behavioral economist, this factor is the
    most important in predicting the common person's response and
    needs at the time the crisis begins unfolding in their nation or
    region.
- this contributes towards dynamics which invert globalization's
  impact on regional manufactoring, while decimating labor markets.
  - That is, American manufacturing is more likely to move home, but
    that doesn't restore lost jobs or the disrupted wealth
    distribution that accompanied globalization.
  - The impact on manufacturing, in particular, is constrained to the
    phenomenological limits of artificial intelligence, 3D printing
    and nano-technology.

- how does this impact the developed world?
  - what does it mean for a rising china?
  - what does it mean for America and the EU?

# [Policy Response: Strategy, Perception, Timing and Pacing]()

- questions to answer:
  - what policy responses are available? UBI and national service
  - what policy responses are appealing?
  - delineate the explanation along economic, sociocultural and
    geopolitical dimensions
    - which options are appealing for developed/underdeveloped
      economies?
    - how does the economic state of a nation and its citizens
      affect the policy?

- (every major government's need for a policy response)
- the choice between UBI and national service
  - the costs/benefits of each will differ depending on how
    developed the nation's economy is.
    - highly developed with lots of cash: UBI will seem more appealing
    - 
  - the governmental structure will partially determine policy
    - authoritarian governments can more easily compel people to
      conform to the policy response

  - in a democracy, the people's attitudes to being compelled to work
    - highly liberal? the inverse of kennedy's maxim prevails
      - ask what the government can do to fix your problems or bitch
        about it

- democracy's are highly disadvantaged because they cannot compel
  people to contribute to concerted economic strategy
  - additionally, the people are easily subverted against themselves
    by foreign powers.

# [Commodity Markets and Resource Distribution]()

- the global economy becomes resource-bound.
  - this defining trait becomes more pronounced as we approach the
    singularity and the next technology plateau.
    - (fabrication technology's impact on supply chains)
    - this moves manufacturing closer to the consumer.
  - more proficient fabrication leads to more self-reliant economies,
    assuming they have the intellectual property and ability to build
    out industrial capacity

- higher commodity prices (lead to resources from space)
  - resources from the arctic, seafloor and space.

- these trends in commodity markets contribute to dynamics in demand
  - what technology is capable of delivering determines what resources
    nations need and thereby determines demand.
  - (conflict theory)

# [Technology's Impact on Commodity Markets]()

- e.g. a gradual shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewables

- The majority of uncapitalized opportunity in the next few decades
  centers around materials science and the resulting intellectual
  property.
  -

# [Distribution and Control of Foreign Direct Investment]()

- technology's impact on globally allocated capital
  - It's cheaper to manufacture closer to the consumer. Doing so
    benefits the economy of the consumer while retaining competitive
    advantage and control over intellectual property related to
    industrial processes.
  - this could drive a minor modality that leads to divestment of
    foreign direct investment, but it's one of many dynamics.

#### supply chain "dimension"

- Thee effect on supply chain dimension of the American & Global
  Economies
  - reference arguments from article on regulating conflict minerals
    trade in african nations
  - elaborate on mechanics/dynamics of shifting supply chains
    - especially in the context of novel materials/fabrication tech

#### International Regulation of Supply Chains

- The interantional regulation of supply chains strongly constrains
  investment behavior... (include this here?)

- There is a fantastic Harvard ILJ article on this specific issue,
  which is absolutely fascinating. In terms of novel-information
  density (i.e. the percentage of content new to me) this single
  article may have accelerated my general level of knowledge more than
  any other writing I've ever consumed.
  - that is, this single article stimulated my own imagination more
    than anything else I have ever read and did so in terms of each:
    - number/kind of specific fields covered and the quantity/quality
      of new information
  - that International Supply Chain article isn't the only such
    article I've consumed in the past 3 months which has accelerated
    my acquisition of knowledge to personally unknown levels.
- TODO: what about it?
  - how is it difficult? how does international supply chain
    regulation affect cost structures and the incentivization of
    corporate behavior?

# [Forex Dynamics and Foreign Currency Reserve Distribution]()

- effects of inflation
- willingness of institutions to lend
- effects on lending
- sustainability of credit-driven policy

# [Distribution of Debt]()

- What happened during the 2008 housing crisis? The subprime housing
  markets crashed and the lost revenue streams thereof triggered
  cascading effects through the global banking system. But how did the
  subprime housing markets crash? An economic downturn that impacted
  the riskiest mortgage assets first.
  - Quite simply, there were people with mortgages who couldn't pay
    their bills. This require shifts in allocation of liquidity to
    cover the lost revenue streams, which triggered recession and
    thereby increased unemployment, leading to more lost revenue
    streams in the housing sector.

- The distribution of debt among consumers and businesses in America
  is critical. The greater the unmet debt burden, the greater the
  effects of such a crisis are to be when they emerge.
  - So, even if there is some policy like UBI that provides the
    *median income*, there will still be many people unemployed above
    the median income who are unable to pay their mortgages and debts.
  - As it intersects with the income distribution of the newly
    unemployed, this distribution of real asset debt (houses and
    cars), then triggers an impulse to sell amoung owners and mortgage
    holders. If you don't know what happens next, I'm not sure why
    you're still reading and I would guess that you're a liberal who
    decides their vote presented only with emotional arguments.

- Remember, in the best case, the government can maintain the median
  income, but without empire, it's impossible for the government to
  drive this median income up.
  - Are you a leftist who rails against American imperialism?
  - ...

# [Population Flux, Entitlements and Median Income]()

- What is the government obligated to provide to each citizen?
  - What is the government obligated to provide for non-citizens and
    illegal immigrants?
  - Did the government enact amnesty programs for illegal immigrants?
    Did it do so because a certain political party wanted to use the
    votes to stay in power?
- How much do people contribute to their regional or national economy
  in return?
  - How much can citizens who were formerly illegal immigrants be
    expected to contribute to GDP and tax volume? So what is their net
    contribution to the deficit? It should be expected to be higher
    than that of legitimate citizens, though at most amnestees would
    account for 5% of the population.
  - But, at some point, we have to decide who is American and who is
    not. Who is our responsibility and who is not?
  - This is a global crisis (expand...)

- Because the crisis inevitably results in inflation, this last factor
  determines the severity of a currency's contribution to disruption
  to forex markets.
  - in turn, this determines risk appetite and drives dynamics in
    deciding where to allocate foreign direct investment.
- Because the economic crisis cannot be lessened except through credit
  directly added to government balance sheets, the more spending that
  is required, the more credit a government will require.
  - Therefore, the more a government or party obligates itself to do
    and the more citizens it is obligated to provide for, the less it
    can do with the same amount of deficit.
- When this deficit is financed through credit, this furthers
  inflation. So therefore, the more people and the more entitlements,
  the faster these macroeconomic dynamics become toxic.

- There are major differences in how this kind of credit-driven policy
  affects the currency and the behavioral economic dynamics.
  - In the nineties and the aughts, the credit stimulated the economy
    through the housing markets, which is a necessary means towards
    promoting home ownership. Therefore, if one manipulates housing
    prices and other aspects of the real-estate market, one can
    increase GDP and tax volume artificially through credit, when the
    credit is seen as necessary and sustainable.
  - When one begins to infuse a deficit ridden government with cash,
    it is not seen in the same light by creditors, investors and other
    backing nations.
    - The effects in floating your economy are, on the surface,
      similar, but this latter method is unsustainable. At this point,
      you are about as close to literally printing money as you can
      get if you're in charge of the world's reserve currency.



## (misc)

### Management of existing debt needs to be flexible

- neither UBI/ELR accounts for consumers' need to maintain existing
  cash flows
  - therefore, consumers with jobs in those industries that are
    automated can no longer pay their mortgages, etc
  - this is another source of potential systemtic economic collapse,
    given high consumer debt appetite and poorly managed credit
  - make the home & garden channel illegal
  - encourage higher payment of existing debt, while the economy
    permits (except this is terrible in a consumer driven economy)

### Sorry Ms. Swift, We Are Not Out of the Woods Yet

  - we need to avoid the tendancy to hack the economy. the factors
    that drove the housing crisis were essentially an attempt to hack
    macroeconomic indicators to drive consumerism and maintain GDP
    growth
    - the flood of cheap credit into domestic industries such as
      construction floated these industries and kept a healthy flux of
      liquidity flowing through the economy. this artificially
      increased employment, etc.
    - but if we are "banking" on these same strategies to float
      macroeconomics via injection of liquidity/credit, the more we
      depend on them, the greater this future crisis will be

### Enslavement by Debt and Desire

- this all leads to a massive depression.
  - this is unlike any depression in history because, for those at the
    top, there is high growth and economic opportunity is plentiful.
  - but, for everyone else, there is no economic opportunity, except
    as artificially provided by the government or those with liquidity
    and a penchant for unnecessary spending.
  - in this depresson, people owe massive sums of debt that the
    economy (does not allow) them to pay. so, our credit institutions
    systemically stagnate. in severe cases, the borrower is unable to
    pay even the interest on their debts.
- the people examining UBI closely enough to spend millions on studies
  could not possibly be totally ignorant of this.

### Even With Inflationary Measures, There is Still Systemic Collapse

- The easy way out is by financing government policy, either UBI or
  some national service, using central banking.
  - Doing so causes inflation and lessens the magnitude of the
    depression.
    - This is because existing debts are easier to pay in the midst of
      inflation.
    - Think this strategy is popular with the financial elite or with
      countries who hold large quantities of dollars in reserve?
      - yeh ok. it's not. so think again, liberals. and maybe shut the
        hell up online while you're at it.
  - ultimately either strategy requires financing via debt through the
    Fed. However, the injection of liquidity is neither.

- because the only way to lessen the magnitude of the crisis is via
  inflation, investment in gold/silver is a good bet.
  - As this approaches, I'd recommend 1% of investment in gold/silver
    per 1% in unemployment.

### Without Inflation, Student Loan Reform is Reasonable

- The actual value of college education is much lower than the price.
  Especially looking forward, one can see that there is less incentive
  to become indebted for a college degree.

  - it is impossible to avoid a convergent economy, where the wealth
    converges into an asymptotically smaller number of hands
  - garbage in, garbage out
    - if computers augment our ability to think, achieve and function,
      then we need ...
