Our diversity is a strength, as long as it unifies us. It's a major
strength. In fact, it is that "thing" that makes America different
from anywhere else in the world. If America was a product, that is how
I would want to market it and, in fact, that is exactly what we did at
the turn of the 19th century.

### Greater Range of Ideas; Greater Range of Flexibility

A diverse culture has a greater range of ideas to draw from. A diverse
culture can't be easily subverted by misinformation because our
response to events is less predictable and any such disruptive foreign
policy strategy would need to account for a greater range of groups
and ideas. Having a larger set of cultural elements also provides us
with greater flexibility.

When foreign or internal powers seek to divide us along ethnic
boundaries, it weakens us, it causes pain, it stifles our progress on
other issues, and it leaves lasting scars. When problems erupt along
ethnic boundaries and things get bad enough, we could be dealing with
the consequences of those problems for two generations. That kind of
scar tissue is sensitive and can be triggered later on. We need a
dialogue on racial and ethnic issues, if we ever want them to improve,
but people on the extremes of any "side" need to calm down.

*Diversity is a strength* as long as we are united through it. If we
allow it to be used against us, if we act on it ourselves and
exacerbate serious issues, then we are squandering the energy and
political capital we could invest in other changes in our society. We
have to address these concerns, so that they become our strength.

Nowhere else in the entire world can you find more diversity than
America! That is our strength! It is our brand. If there was
nationalism in America, what would it look like? Nationalism is fueled
by pride in one's nation. We should be proud of our diversity and
determined to make it a strength. In America, nationalism shouldn't
divide us along ethnic boundaries. It should unite us.

America is a microcosm of the world. Our world is lucky to have such a
great nation, a superpower, where so many cultures flourish
together. Yes, there is a ton of progress to be made, but
overpopulation threatens the world like never before. Resources are
dwindling. These are the causes that spark war, except they are going
to occur on a global scale.

In a way, America has been cursed by a legacy of centuries-old
genocide and slavery. But in a way, we are blessed by it because here
we are in the most powerful country in the world and we are forced to
resolve these differences. We have to. Think about what it'd be like
to live in a world where the handful of most powerful nations did not
have much ethnic diversity. How would an overpopulation conflict play
out then?

*Mark my words: what happens in America with regard to ethnic tensions
is an indication of what will happen for the rest of the world.*
Like I said, America is a microcosm. Our diversity here symbolically
reflects the diversity everywhere else. If these problems boil over
and promote instability, the same thing will happen the world over. So
we seriously need to get our shit together and figure this out. As
individuals, we have to be willing to turn the other cheek; to reach
out; to seek understanding. If we do not do that here, now, it's an
incredibly bad omen for the world in 2050.

From 2009 through 2013, I felt unfairly labeled as a racist,
occassionally. I don't know how it happened.  For a variety of
reasons, I suppose, none of which had anything to do with me making
overtly racially-oriented statements. Moreso, I didn't feel any
negativity towards any ethnic group, even when I felt I was unfairly
labeled. First it happened to a minor degree in jamskating. Then, it
happened at each job I had, where I would have to strongly assert
myself to avoid being labelled as racist. Like each time I got a new
job, I would get the feeling that someone had labelled me that
way. Nothing major, nothing overt. Each time, within a week. I figured
it was because I had a southern accent because I was not sending any
of those signals. I had long since learned my lesson: leave my
politics at home, so it wasnt that. They could have identified those
from my Facebook, though.

I got the feeling I was labelled because it was politically
convenient. I mean political in the sense that labelling me allowed
someone to gain advantage by discrediting me amoung the people in some
group: jamskaters or coworkers. But, to some degree, I mean political
in the traditional sense, in that I saw it used as a tool to restrain
& isolate other people, mostly Libertarians. I think it was used on me
in that way. To some people, Libertarian was a euphemism for
racist. There is one specific situation I recall, where I made
well-meaning, but insensitive comments to an individual.

But in the workplace or public life, I could never respond to it
because it was always an insinuation. That kind of stuff is cowardly,
if you ask me. If you have a problem with someone *and you want it to
improve*, then you'll reach out to them and talk to them. If you want
an excuse to exacerbate problems, then labelling someone as racist is
perfect because that person is not likely to be able to respond. It's
not exactly a subject you would bring up. And *think about it*, if the
person actually cared about the sensitivity of these issues, would
they carelessly use it as a tool? To gain minor political advantage in
some group dynamic? That completely disregards the sensitivity of this
subject!

If you find yourself labelled in this way, any statement that you make
feels stilted. No one's going to ask you directly or confirm. The best
you'll get is people *rorshocking* you, which is like bouncing trigger
words off you and gauging your response. It's about as scientific as a
fucking fortune teller. And if this person is malicious and trying to
mislead people, selfishly exploiting a sensitive subject to gain
personal advantage, do you think they're going to give you the benefit
of the doubt? No! It's a tool to discredit you by playing to an issue
that an *amoral baby-eating sociopath* sees as being effective in a
disgusting, utilitarian manner.

When people are A/B testing your reactions like this, don't you think
that has the propensity to go horribly wrong? In fact, wouldn't it
create a negative, corrosive feedback loop, driving people to
experience negativity by being labelled as racist when they are not?
Or when direct, straightforward statements to that person would have
indicated to them that they should shut the fuck up because they don't
know what they are talking about and race is a sensitve subject that
shouldn't be approached without care?

(grammatical typo)

That's one reason I care enough to risk sounding like a insensitive
shithead... Occasionally. Tolerance? Discrimination? How do we improve
these? How can someone improve a social issue they can't talk about?
Yes, we should be more tolerant! Absolutely! But we also have to be
tolerant of people who are intolerant. That doesn't mean we should
like it, no!



If you completely cut someone off who's been labelled as racist, what
does that do? Has anyone in this country actually watched American
History X? How does the character Lamont breakthrough to the neonazi
character? Does he do it by ignoring that character? Avoiding him?
Isolating him? No! Just the opposite.

#### Respond to Intolerance with Tolerance

If we want to resolve ethnic tensions in America, we need
communication and we can't immediately respond to a differing
viewpoint by escalating tension. We have to respond to intolerance
itself with tolerance!

> Matter protestors, but instead is advice for any social movement.

#### Speak Through Tremendous Action

Watch how people react to those who disagree with them. I admire
people like Gandhi and Dr. King because they dealt with a lot of
outright injustice and they did it with grace! They knew their actions
spoke more powerfully than any words they could ever utter. They knew
they were surrounded by people who wanted change and people who were
vitriously opposed to it.

#### Truth as a Strategy

But, how did they respond? They allowed their actions to speak for
themselves and they allowed their opponents actions to speak for their
opponents and they believed that people would see things as they
were. That is it! Their strategy was truth! Truth and nothing more!

#### Truth and Loving Our Enemy

Except perhaps loving their enemy enough to grant him or her
forgiveness for their ignorance. And they suffered for this. They
suffered through the ignorance and intolerance, but maintained the
grace to forgive their enemies, right through the midst of it all.
It's not easy to maintain your inner peace in the middle of some grave
injustice.

There are too many people on all sides with insensitive and/or flat
out wrong viewpoints. Some of my own viewpoints are insensitive.  I'm
sorry if that's the case. I absolutely do not condone or intend to
encourage any kind of racist or intolerant bullshit. We need to come
together in this country.
