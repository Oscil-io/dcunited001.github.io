Have you noticed the creeping darkness in our country over the past
decade? Well I did and I was one of the first. IMO, were are in the
middle of a partially aborted neo-Bolshevik revolution where a drunk
doctor addicted to cheap money has empowered the wrong people.

We were never supposed to figure this was happening until it was too
late. And so now we have to deal with this grotesque nightmare of
figurative "sepsis" ... No, it's not the kind of sepsis that somehow
gives you the persistent chlamydia from weeks of late night ragers and
promiscuous sex. Nope, this is the sepsis that turns America's own
immune system against itself. And now people are getting pissed.

People seem to be waking up to the fact that we're in something like a
cockfight. Except, one of those roosters has it's head cut off and
it's not a fair fight. Oh yeah, and international bankers are trying
to take bets on who's going to win this fight. I don't know why that
other rooster is fighting us, but I know that we're losing. Or it sure
as hell looks like we are because, to me, it's obvious that an
anti-American cancer has taken strong root in our country. It's
spreading and it's turning us against ourselves, via HomeSec and our
intelligence community. As far as I can see, someone decided to take
that totalitarian apparatus we constructed in the Bush administration
and they turned it against America. Then someone hacked the comm
protocols ... and oh yeh, THEY HAVE A FUCKING LIST OF AGENTS AND
DEFENSE INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES.

Meanwhile, it's pushing many policies which are going to wreck the
American economy, leaving the chips of the global economy in the hands
of whoever is driving this cockfight. That's the calling card of
Bolshevik politics: pursue policies with duplicitous arguments that
appeal to the poor in the *short-term* by siphoning wealth and
influence away from the rich and are disastrous for everyone in the
long-term.

In the end, when the dust settles, no one will have power or money and
the people who get blamed? Well, it's the Bourgeoisie of course! This
requires a total reset, where the people installed with power have
zero generations of experience under their belt. The only thing they
managed to accomplish was a catastrophic economic disaster while
avoiding accountability via deceipt and duplicity.

The fallout? America loses it's wealth and loses it's influence on a
global scale, placing the power in the hands of the shitdicks that
made this happen, all while leaving the common American with the same
damn problems they had before: crippling poverty. Oh, except "it's OK"
because "now there's no classes! Everybody's poor!" YAYY! Superfun!
Every American's just as poor as the other and the rest of the world
takes turns gangraping America for a century.

That's right, they out there fuckin' Lady Libery down by the harbor
and everyone in Manhattan can hear that bitch screaming, but because
she's got a bag on her head and asphixated by the gag in her throat,
it's OK.  It's OK folks. Lady Liberty's turnin blue in the face and
somebody's running a train on her and everyone knows it, but ... it's
OK?

### Fear of Speaking Out

To me, this is equally terrifying as it is obvious. Why? BECAUSE THIS
IS HAPPENING AND THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD STOP IT SEEM TO BE SOILING
THEMSELVES IN FEAR OF SPEAKING OUT. FOSO. These bozos have F.O.S.O.
