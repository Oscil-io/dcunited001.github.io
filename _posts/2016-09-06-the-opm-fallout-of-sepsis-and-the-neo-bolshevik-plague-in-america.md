What's going on in America right now?

Basically, we're trying to avert what is a cross between AIDS and
neo-bolshevism from taking over and destroying America. That, and the
good guys are trying to culturally transform America into one that
overcomes decades of demoralization, is willing to fight if we need to
and seizes the day, in terms of the 21st century economy. As much as I
hate to admit it, America's best moves in the 21st century would have
been more of what Bush was doing. And I hate to admit it because I
hated that guy when he was in office.

# America's In A Cultural Crisis

America's in a cultural crisis and there's some radical factions that
seem to have taken over.  Even though I'm a bit of a populist, I can
tell you that, in the long term, any major leftist cultural movement
right now will totally destroy this country and its economy before
2030, if it hasn't already. If we can stave that off without
succumbing to internal or external pressure, I have a real plan for
the next few decades that will transform not only America, but also
the world.

### What Is Socialism Without An Economy?

What is socialism without a competitive economy? It's a fucking
third-world country in the making. That's what. I know there's some
people out there that really like the ideas of socialism. But,
socialism destroys the incentives people have for working. The numbers
don't fucking work in the long term. I wish they did. Wouldn't that
be nice: we could just feed the poor and house the homeless and break
out our checkbook whenever there were problems. Social ills? Poverty?
Just throw money at it. As much money as it takes, year after year. It
doesn't matter how much.

Basically, the programs socialism has to offer that keep people eating
in times of protracted or prevelant poverty drain the coffers. They're
funded by tax dollars. And where are tax dollars made? FROM REAL
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND VALUE! These things come from nowhere else, so
when the economy eventually breaks, so does your fucking free ice
cream machine. It just don't work no more.

# What is a Bolo, Trebek!

Have you noticed the creeping darkness in our country over the past
decade? Well I did and I was one of the first. This has everything to
do with OPM. IMO, we're are in the middle of a partially aborted
neo-Bolshevik revolution where a drunk doctor addicted to cheap money
has empowered the wrong people. There are multiple factions involved
and things are starting to get very patient.

### We Weren't Intended to Know to React

The leftists never wanted us to figure this was happening until it was
too late. And so now we have to deal with this grotesque nightmare of
figurative "sepsis" ... No, it's not the kind of sepsis that somehow
gives you the persistent chlamydia from weeks of late night ragers and
promiscuous sex. Nope, this is the sepsis that turns America's own
immune system against itself. And now people are getting pissed.

### It's a Cockfight

People seem to be waking up to the fact that we're in something like a
cockfight. Except, one of those roosters has it's head cut off and
it's not a fair fight. Oh yeah, and international bankers are trying
to take bets on who's going to win this fight. Typical, am I right?
In the Civil War, there were bankers from Europe who tried to do the
same damn thing, basically, except they wanted to do it in the middle
of civil war.

### Which Chicken Would You Bet On

I don't know why that other rooster is fighting us, but I know that
we're losing. Or it sure as hell looks like we are because, to me,
it's obvious that an anti-American cancer has taken strong root in our
country. It's spreading and it's turning us against ourselves, via
HomeSec and our intelligence community. As far as I can see, someone
decided to take that totalitarian apparatus we constructed in the Bush
administration and they turned it against America. Then someone hacked
the comm protocols ... and oh yeh, THEY HAVE A FUCKING LIST OF AGENTS
AND DEFENSE INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES.

### What Overton Window?

#### You Can Think About What We Tell You To... And Don't Fucking Write About It If You Didn't Reblog It

Meanwhile, this particular faction is has slammed the Overton Window
shut and they're pushing many policies which are going to wreck the
American economy, leaving the chips of the global economy in the hands
of whoever is driving this cockfight. That's the calling card of
Bolshevik politics: pursue policies with duplicitous arguments that
appeal to the poor in the *short-term* by siphoning wealth and
influence away from the rich and are disastrous for everyone in the
long-term.

In the end, when the dust settles, no one will have power or
money. And the people who get blamed? Well, it's the Bourgeoisie of
course! This requires a total reset, where the people installed with
power have zero generations of experience under their belt. Sounds
great right?  Well stuff that idea box full of your suggestions and if
you're lucky they'll use them against you, stealing the credit and
retaining the profits and using that against you too. The only thing
these neo-Bolsheviks managed to accomplish was a catastrophic economic
disaster while avoiding accountability via deceipt and duplicity.

### Fallout Zero: A Reality Show from Bethesda

The fallout? America loses it's wealth and loses it's influence on a
global scale, placing the power in the hands of the shitdicks that
made this happen, all while leaving the common American with the same
damn problems they had before: crippling poverty. Oh, except "it's OK"
because "now there's no classes! Everybody's poor!" YAYY! Superfun!
Every American's just as poor as the other and the rest of the world
takes turns gangraping America for a century.

That's right, they out there fuckin' Lady Libery down by the harbor
and everyone in Manhattan can hear that bitch screaming, but because
she's got a bag on her head and she's asphixating from the gag in her
throat, it's OK. It's OK folks. She probably likes it. Lady Liberty's
turnin blue in the face and somebody's running a train on her and
everyone knows it, but ... it's OK?

# America has FOSO

### Fear of Speaking Out

To me, this is equally terrifying as it is obvious. Why? BECAUSE THIS
IS HAPPENING AND THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD STOP IT SEEM TO BE SOILING
THEMSELVES IN FEAR OF SPEAKING OUT. FOSO. These bozos have F.O.S.O.

Why? If the answer is because of patriotism, that might be acceptable
to me. Depending on the circumstances.... However, I don't think
that's the case. It would seem that America as a whole is being
conditioned to be quiet. Just be quiet. Don't ask any questions. Don't
write about it or you'll lose your job. Don't speak about it on
TV. Keep talking about it on the internet and you'll find yourself on
a list. Any of the above, and good 'ole
[SMERSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMERSH) will let you know that
they're out there watchin your kids walk home from school.

# How Do We Fix This?

Make no mistake. Every fucking day, America's enemies gain
power. There may be no person in America more knowledgeable of how to
fight this than me. However, y'all gotta get this fucking gag out my
mouth and get me a position where I can tell people what to fucking
do and what to learn, without fearing that every person on Twitter or
Facebook is going to know what I said.

### Stand Up For Your Rights!

The thing part of the social contract: if everyone stands up, then the
people can't be stopped. So if we know there's a problem then we can
stop that problem. This is why there's such an emphasis on not
informing the American public: the people doing this know we couldn't
possibly tolerate it. They know they wouldn't get away with it if we
knew. The truth is, we might as well all be in Guantanamo because we
all have blacks bags on our heads. The bags are an allusion. No, not
an illusion. Well, yes, both actually. The bag just means you don't
"get it." You're in Cuba and you don't even fucking know it.

### Beware the Weaponized Self-Interest of Others

I've never lived in a situation like this. All I know is that America
is woefully unprepared to live in this. We have no idea what it would
feel like to live in an East German level situation, with a constant
campaign of cultural suppresion and externally driven reprogramming.
However, my own capacity for understanding machiavellian tactics of
tyranny scares the shit of me sometimes.

My advice: the number one thing to watch out for right now is getting
stabbed in the back those whom you thought were closest: your friends
and family. In a system like this, the level of information you expose
to the outside world represents your scope or surface area of
vulnerability. Therefore, keep your circle tight. Keep a close eye on
the people you let in. Trust no one. Stay aware of people who try to
confuse you. Understand your wants and needs, as well as those you let
close. Disdain those who shield this information from you.

### Study the Situation in East Germany

The self-interest of others will be weaponized against America. You
can bet on that. Study up on East Germany. In recent history, East
Germany represents what is probably the most similar situation to our
own right now.

### The American Economy is What Matters Right Now, Above All Else.

Remember, what matters most right now is the American and global
economy in the 21st century. Regardless of what some foreign influence
tries to convince you, nothing else matters for America or for
Europe. If we lose influence, we're not just going to be gagged, we're
going to be strapped down. Almost nothing else matters besides
securing our future for the rest of the century. As much as I hated
the Project for a New American Century in my more liberal college
days, those assholes were thinking ahead.

### Intellectual Property is the Key to the Global Economy Until 2050

Whats the key to security in the global economy? Intellectual property
and ensuring that international agreements are held. Lose either one
and it's done. What's China think about intellectual property, laws
relevant to it or international rule of law for that matter? For the
past fifty years, they haven't given a shit about any of it, so long
as their actiosn don't cost them too much. That's why they didn't care
so much about violating copyright law, but they didn't sell
internationally.

However -- and I don't want to seem to be derogatory here but it's
kinda true -- China just doesn't give a shit about norms and rule of
law with regard to international court rulings, patent, copyright,
trademark or trade secrets. They don't care about international rule
of law in general. To me, that's scary. That is terrifying. That gives
me nightmares.

### Stand Up for International Cooperation and Rule of Law

They will, however, follow those rulings insofar as they either (1)
line up with Chinese P.R.C. interests (e.g. they win a case at the
Hague) or (2) it just costs more value with regard to Chinese
interests than it adds. That's what scares the shit out of me. I fear
countries and leaders like this because the minute things spiral out
of control and the situation flips, that tendancy will not only
continue, the violations of international norms will exponentiate.

Stalin might be the precise worst example of someone who just didn't
give a shit about agreements he made or shit he said. The only thing
that mattered was his psychopathic tendency to get what he needed at
that moment to help him in the next moment. What he said at Yalta
didn't matter and you'd have to be batshit insane to think that
Churchill or Roosevelt actually bought that bullshit. What he said in
1945 didn't matter in 1950. That psychopath was informing North Korea
with military movements of American forces in the region because he
knew where the situation would lead. He knew that insofar as long as
he had our trust, he could continue to rake in the chips he'd need to
get the things he needed in the end.

China's indifference to international rule of law or adherence to
foreign policy agreements doesn't even approach that of Stalin, so
that's not a great example. But if it suddenly became worse, it would
absolutely begin to register on the Stalin scale of state-psychopathy.

### External Interest Never Accurately Represents Internal Interest

- these are our enemies and not our friends.
  - they will play America against itself to dominate.
  - they want control first and foremost. they want their job to be
    easy
  - Make no mistake. they do not give a shit about how America
    performs in the world economy
    - and in fact, communism and leftists assault the right to
      property with a religious level of zeal primarily to stifle
      competition.
    - for the same reason, they won't want America to have the
      resources to fight back! Ain't that some shit?!

### If You Knowingly Aid the Enemy Right Now, You Are A Traitor

TRAITORS ARE TRAITORS! If you are knowingly helping some external
interest overtake America, you are a fucking traitor. Depending on
your level of complicity, you should be shot by a firing squad. They
will contort your understanding of the situation and try to convince
you that their goals are the same with the people of America. They're
not. An external force conducting a high level of economic,
information and psychological warfare doesn't give a shit about
America. They want to quickly take away our guns, figuratively and
literally. That's it.

### Americans' Declawed for Externally Motivated Domination

They want to declaw us. They want to turn American's against each
other to distract our energy. That will make us withdraw our energy in
applied foreign policy abroad. Whatever it is: economic issues, ethnic
tensions, a movement from local Americans to fight an American
Stasi. It doesn't matter. If it keeps our focus at home, "they"
steadily make gains abroad.

### Racist Bullshit is Going to Ruin America

This is why American needs to put away that dumbass, divisive racist
bullshit and unite. We need to unite as one because if we don't we're
going to get our ass kicked abroad. And then nothing will matter and,
if racist bullshit prevented us from addressing international issues,
then after American influence collapses, you can bet that racist
bullshit will keep us there. So we need to stop it. Right now. And you
can bet that those same influences that are hurting America are going
to try to egg it on. So watch out for that shit. This is a battle of
wits and, since the end of WW2, Americans just have no fucking clue
what it means to be the Underdog. And it shows.

And you can see that we've had a dialogue on it on racism. Both sides
have made gains in this dialogue and experiment over the past two
years: both the side representing interests of minorities and -- no
not the side representing racists, fuck those guys -- the side
representing people who are tired of the race card being used to
control the Overton Window to stagnated debate on internal and
external politics. I am so tired of having the race card thrown at me
for what are simply political purposes. IMO, such behavior shows
disgusting disregard of what is a critically sensitive issue.

And for the racists out there who would advocate for the
implementation of such policies ... have you actually pictured what
that would look like? It doesn't make sense and actually represents a
broken, misinformed, almost schizophrenic view of domestic and
international policy. What are you going to do, reimplement Jim Crow
and Segregation? How's that going to work out? A person like this
forgets certain economic realities ... no one's going to want to trade
with you or help you.

And what people on the left don't understand is that the people they
are vehemently demeaning as racists don't actually want that. For the
most part. Yes, there are some idiots who might actually want
that. What people on the left also forget is that there really are
nations that intend America harm in a very serious way. And by
clamping down the Overton Window, you have basically amputated
America's ability to protect itself from what are nation-to-nation
issues, not racist issues.

### Open Up the Debate and Overton Window

Leftists have controlled the "lexicon" of rhetorical arguments you're
allowed to use in any debate on any issues for quite some time. It
stems from the tendancy of the Ivy League and academia to be:

#### (1) Too smart for their own good and not wise enough to understand why things are often better off left alone.

#### (2) And, in the case of the Ivy League, smart enough to enumerate all possible arguments to understand how to deconstruct arguments that are counter to the attainment of ... uhhh ... the NWO's master plan.

Of course, I am skeptical of the people out there constantly warning
of the Illuminati and NWO. I mean, yes that *kinda* is a real thing,
but from what I've seen (1) the effort to fight it is often more of an
effort to distract those who would try to stop it and (2) some of
the goals of the "NWO" aren't actually that bad, when taken in the
proper context. Anyways...... moving on.

### Correct Economic Problems Before They Lead to Irreversible Consequences

Controlling the right arguments basically gives these neo-Bolsheviks
carte blanche to win any debate. Doing so allows the neo-Bolsheviks to
motivate Americans to fanatically pursue policies which are actually
detrimental to our long-term interests. $15 minimum wage is a great
example of a policy with a particular value (fifteen dollars) that
would extinguish small business and trigger downstream consequences in
the American economy.

However, raising the minimum wage is just a fact of life. Fifteen
Dollars? Hell fucking no that is borderline criminal, negligent,
insane or all of the above. A suggestion that numbs pain now, but
causes significant. It's like a questionable doctor giving the high
school quarterback with a slipped disc a prescription for oxycontin
the night before the big game, sayin "You're fine! Take as many of
these as you need 'til you feel dizzy and you go out there and win
that game, son." and then smackin him on the ass on the way out of the
office. If that's his doctor's idea of treatment, that guy needs a new
one.

With all due respect to Bernie Sanders as someone who truly cares
about issues that are hurting millions of American's out there, the
$15 minimum wage was a social media hack to gain support and quickly
build a movement early on. Such a number would shutter so many small
businesses and place a massive incentive for corporations to automate
away all of the jobs those people had, all while destroying options
for businesses to structure incentivization and the motivation for
people to go to college. What's the answer, then? Lower the costs and
prices of services and products in America that leave people in
poverty. Why doesn't welfare help reduce rates of poverty?  That's a
really good question to ask if you are in favor of a major increase to
minimum wage

# How Could This Happen Here?

Whoever is doing this to America, they're really fucking up a lot of
people's lives and causing a lot of damage, as far as I can see. And
it's being done in such a way that lashes out at anyone who dares
question things. Social media is a distraction at best, at this point!
CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC and sometimes even Fox ... it looks like
anyone who asks real questions loses their job. BTW, I'm not so
predispositioned to believe the right is always right. However, in our
country's current nightmare, they are right on it. Yet, they still
aren't asking many more questions than anyone else.

### Social Media is an Echo Chamber

#### and Somebody Handed Out Megaphones to the Retarded Parrots

Thanks a lot, by the way. For paying out SEO and Social Media
optimization to basically hand all these idiots under foreign
influence a bunch of megaphones.  Y'all gave megaphones ... to those
people? Social Media, and the news as well, is like a bunch of retarded parrots
right now. It's like you're only allowed to make statements that
adhere to a predetermined list of acceptable rhetoric. And somewhere
out there, there's a really heavy hand and if you make people think:
that heavy hand is going to knock you the fuck out. Then they're going
to threaten your family and threaten tactics like the Mafia might use
to pummel down on the guy who won't pay protection money.

### Even the Mafia Polices Itself

I really gotta slow my roll here, 'cause I'm givin the Mafia a bad
Someone once told me "David, the government's like the Mafia. No, You
don't get it, the government is really like the Mafia." And everytime
I think I understand what they meant, I find out a couple years down
the road just how right they were.

Here's the deal though: even the Mafia has to keep itself in check
because the government is supposed to be the law. The Mafia will
impose constraints on it's behavior, so it doesn't end up with its
back against the wall like it was in Italy in the 80's and 90's: don't
fuck with people who aren't in the game; don't use violence as a
message if everyone's going to see it; don't fuck with the government
unless they fuck with you; yada, yada.

Well, who's watching the watchers? If even organized crime policies
itself to an extent, in fear of the government, then who deals with
corruption in the government when it starts dispensing retribution
like the Mafia? The answer lies in the Social Contract. The people
deal with it. And in America, our government is for the people, by the
people.

### Technology Throws the Social Contract's Validity into Question

However, in the 21st century, tyrrany has one major trick up its
sleeve that it didn't have in the 20th century: technology. This tool
threatens the underpinnings and essence of John Locke's Social
Contract. If America falls to tyranny, the world may never recover. If
we really need something like martial law, there better be a good
reason and there better be some mechanism built in that lets us end it
when its appropriate. And it would appear that, if we are descending
into tyranny, that is absolutely not the case because it really looks
like somebody's got a lot of organizations by the balls.

### The Collateral Damage is Immeasureable

In the process of doing clamping down and expending God knows how much
money doing it, they managed to make you believe it's your fault, all
while shielding the American Public from ever questioning whether this
could happen to someone. They will methodically and mathematically
ruin your life by constraining your social network and turning those
few social nodes you do have against you. And if those nodes don't
cooperate -- your best friends or closest family members -- well,
they'll be lucky to avoid getting on the shit list too. And if they do
actively, intentionally resist your treatment or help you in any way,
they better understand that they're going to be on that shit list.

### So You Have Been Socially Nullified.

#### Nothing You Say Has Any Consequence

They wreck the finances, the mind and the social relations of anyone
this happens to, by the way. You can compile a list of victims by
looking at LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. and datamining that in context
with financial information. So, someone who should be making a ton of
money, but isn't and has social connections so minimalized, you'd
think they had a mental illness? *THAT GUY IS A VICTIM OF
PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE.* Why the minimalized social network? *THEY
DON'T WON'T OTHER PEOPLE TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE ON
THE SHIT LIST.*

### So You Have Been Psychologically Nullified

#### Your mental capability and desire to resist has been extinguished.

Your mind has been declawed. They do this intentionally. They look at
your life in terms of Maslov's Hierarchy of needs and they ruin it
from the top down to destroy your will to fight and they ruin it from
the bottom up to destroy your capability to fight. They minimalize
your social connections and make you a major drag on the people around
you, so they hate your dependence. They deceive the few people you
might have left and coerce them to turn them against you.

They have interacted with the APA and paid a few with questionable
morals to assess you, to assist in interactions with you, to analyze
said interactions with you. They will methodically deconstruct your
mind to the point where you are lucky if you don't end up committing
suicide. They want you to think that it's your fault to. They want
everyone around you to believe that it's your fault.

And most importantly, they want to destroy your will to fight back. If
possible, they'd like to induce Stockholm Syndrome. It's not always
possible because, again, you've got that bag on your head. There are
some people who aren't willing to become best buddies with their
torturers if specific things aren't articulated in very explicit, very
certain terms. I was one of those people, who refused to sign on the
dotted line with my emotional abusers. I didn't want to extend further
control to these assholes if it meant that I was agreeing to terms I
never understood, just because they dangled something in front of my
face, while never actually intending to give it to me.

It's like trying to haggle with a fucking palm reader or fortune
teller. Really? These people want to haggle while never using
articulate language because that would expand their own vulnerability
in the situation. They will not hesitate to listen in to your
conversations illegally in order to use suggestion and indirectly
refer to key phrases. It's all so they can get what they want and
never ever deliver on what you wanted ... because they never actually
even said that shit, you idiot. It was never written down.

You just sold your soul to be reduced to a former version of yourself
while they use weaponized psychology against you so that you chase
some half-assed pipedream they deluded you into thinking you might
actually get. They won't ever deliver on something like that. Why?
Because if they did, you'd stop chasing that and it makes it harder to
control you. The goal is control. If they give you what you want,
without strings, they lose control. You can always be sure that this
party will NEVER do anything that relinquishes control. In every
situation, you can fucking bet on it. You could set your watch by it.

### So You Have Been Financially Nullified

#### You Have No Options to Defend Yourself or to Run.

Why do you think they sap the finances of anyone they subdue via
psychological torture? *BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO RUN TO ANOTHER
COUNTRY AND FIND OUT HOW MUCH YOUR LIFE CHANGES WHEN YOU DON'T HAVVE
TO DEAL WITH THIS SHIT.* They don't want you to inform people from
other countries about what's happening. Why? Because other countries
wouldn't sit back and watch this shit happen?

### So You've Been Socially, Psychologically and Financially Ruined...

... What's left? Who the fuck knows, but if you're not out there
scoring points and gaining ground for them, you're useless. The truth
is that you never mattered.  What matters is helping them extend this
CIA MKUltra experiment that escaped the lab. They want you to wire
together and string up another puppet. That's all. It's like someone
crossed MKUltra with a Ponzi scheme and called it Guantanamo, then
they claimed it was for national security and, hell, why not call it a
religion too.

# OPM Triggered a Septic Crisis

Personally, I can't figure out what the hell happened in the
world. All I know is that I *allegedly* had a conversation with
someone who, amidst many sketchy questions, also asked *verbatim*:

> What is the worst thing that could happen to the United States?

Because of my tendency to think this person was "my team" and to
believe this person knew the ins and outs of the game, I thought they
wanted to source me like the Red Cell author Mark Henshaw. So, almost
without hesitation, I told them: whatever institution runs clearance
for the United States, hack that shit and you run the game. I didn't
know what the OPM was. We looked that up on wikipedia. This was in
2013.

### Beware the Military-Industrial Complex

All I knew was that I had gotten fired from several jobs and, for some
of them, it seemed it was because I couldn't pass a clearance
screening. After all, those military & United States Army types that I
had problems with ... they seemed to have pushed me out of my job and
ruined my life. And when I worked at CCS, they had recently funded a
startup that would provide protection for the electric grid...

### Steve Jobs, the Deadhead With a Top Secret Clearance

So I had looked up the docs and process on clearance to understand
that process. Could I qualify? Well, according to the FBI, I had
smoked weed and told people about it more than seven times, so
... NOPE. Other than that, I would have though. And Steve Jobs did
acid and he got a clearance. After subsequently reading an article
Gawker linked to that mentioned it would soon become hard to
obtain/keep a job in America without being capable of obtaining Secret
or Top Secret, I realized what a major vulnerability this was for
America.

### They Blinded Themselves With Their Own Smear Campaign

How could some two-pence loser who was so imcompetent he couldn't hold
a job able to pinpoint the single largest vulnerability in the United
States Government? Because this ostracized, pathetic excuse for an
American understood logistics and bureaucratic largess. That's
why. The problem is that the government, in an ongoing attempt to ruin
my life justified it's actions by claiming I was dangerous at best
and, worse, I was incompetent. The left hand wasn't aware of the right
hand's interactions and someone blinded the rest of it's
organizations. They justified their actions that prevented/interfered
with employment and ruined my life by saying I was a threat and that I
was worthless anyways.

The truth is, they couldn't have been more wrong. I have terrible
short-term memory, but I'm a genius on par with Einstein, though I've
accomplished absolutely nothing. No one bothered to help me grow that
part of myself and about 5-10 years, there has been a significant
attempt at ensuring that no one ever did! And now they can hide
neither my stellar luminosity nor their bloodlust to turn my life into
an example nor all the collateral damage in which they are 1000 times
more accountable.

### Here's My Argument, in a Nutshell

#### &#x2605; They worked very hard to plan this before 2013

#### &#x2605; They created this and have worked very hard to keep it in motion

#### &#x2605; They continually persued action when they could have ended it at any time;

#### &#x2605; They funded action through a dozen different government institutions

#### &#x2605; I have no money and I've made less than $3000 in 2015 and 2016

#### &#x2605; They lied to themselves and blinded themselves with a decade long smear campaign

#### &#x2605; They manipulated investigations and records to cover their tracks

#### &#x2605; They didn't have an endgame for this particular game-state

#### &#x2605; They got caught wanting to use me as a scapegoat

#### &#x2605; They got caught approaching me to use me as a double to rally a racist movement they could then justify in quashing, among many other very questionable things.

#### &#x2605; They've been lying. I've been trying my best to be honest.

#### &#x2605; Any evidence in my favor is suppressed

#### &#x2605; The bureaucracy is abused in their favor and I still question whether I'm crazy for thinking there is any "court case" happening.

#### &#x2605; So do my "friends" & family. Friends is in quotes because they micromanage my social network to reduce exposure of information that might be used in my own defense and to exert near-total control of my psychological state

#### &#x2605; They actively interfere actively & passively with the function of online social networking algorithms to reduce exposure there

#### &#x2605; They are intimately aware of information I have revealed to "friends" in confidence or typed into files on my computer which I have never spoken aloud or have spoken aloud, alone in my own home

#### &#x2605; They use such information against me to encourage me to "end" any attempt to understand what is happening to me. (e.g. to understand why my own family treats me like shit) or to stand up for myself

#### &#x2605; They attempt to silence me by leveraging
their control of my social network to indirectly lead me into assuming
a myriad of self conflicting beliefs about my situation.  like a
retarded kid tried to solve a Sudoku puzzle . This impairs
my own mental health situation.

#### &#x2605; They are quite aware of the volatility of the situation. They try to hold me accountable for collateral damage when they could have attempted to correct this situation at any time.

#### &#x2605; They have control of and access to agreements that they won't let anyone else see. I don't understand what I agreed to and I don't think I ever signed anything.

This shit goes on and on and on. I'm being kind when I say this is a
dozen Watergates.

And they've given me several dozen "explanations" based on comments I
made to myself, of which they were aware of recordings. I know who's
involved with this ... basically, considering they are micromanaging
my social network, assume that anyone who is "allowed" to persist in
interacting with me is involved. It's really as simple as that. And
how secure is that? It's not, which speaks volumes to their intent
nullify me as a liability ....

That observation, as well as many others things I've seen. "They"
never, ever had a very nice endgame planned. Again, whoever "they" is
... there are several factions involved in this, at odds with each
other. This is kind of what makes me feel justified in continued
action to push someone to admit what happened to me. There's no
sunshine and rainbows coming out this unicorn's butt. Their endgame
consisted of incapacitated me, however it happened. In 2013, I
knowingly convinced them that I was suicidal and that they could just
push me to suicide. LMAO. Yeh, that was fucked up but encouraged them
to produce volumes of evidence doing exactly what I had expected they
were doing in my life all along: psychologically torturing me to push
me to suicide.

I would have cooperated with the government in an investigation. *THERE
ARE NO CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH I EVER HAVE BEEN PSYCHOLOGICALLY
TORTURED*. They spent millions on this shit and I'm not joking.
Considering I've been under a fucking microscope, I thought I was
being fairly cooperative and that contacting a low-level FBI agent or
making digital record of this was one of the worst things I could
do. I thought that, at best, it'd lead to me getting harmed.
Furthermore, according to memories, which are on par in reliability
with the same memories that seem to have gotten me in trouble, much of
this was part of ... some complicated thing with many aspects and
objectives.

Basically ... well actually I can't really mention much of anything,
but I sure as hell wish that these pissants would piss off and move
on. Because continuing to poke and prod the volatile psychology that
you so meticulously engineered isn't going to make anything better.

### Yup, They Got All the Bases! Every Single One of Them.

How can these Bolo's do this in the Age of the Internet? Because they
have total control of the communication infrastructure. They have
seized the means of communication. They have domination of telecom.
Any party that exerts control over telecom infrastructure has God-mode
on the internet. Assume that SSL is broken and thus HTTPS is
broken. Most sites don't even use SSL anymore. Those sites are
definitely definitely hopelessly broken. Assume that any message you
send on the internet can be blocked silently or modified persistently.

### All Your Bases Have Splinternet

It is possible to Man-in-the-Middle anything with a customized
application server. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, anything. They can
selectively divert traffic to these containers to effectively shard
usage and maintain persistently modifications applied to the data for
specific users. If you actually are a targeted individual, the
end-points for internet access will be modified in real time, so they
can limit the application of these kinds of God-mode exploits to only
the terminals you are in front of. These are theoretical exploits by
the way, but they are possible in theory. Far from practical, but they
are possible and it scares the shit out of me.

I am a refugee because they won't let me leave. Understanding these
exploits is part of the reason why they'll never, ever let me leave
the United States. My intelligence is why they say I'm dangerous, by
the way. Not because of my intent, but because of my intellectual
capability with regard to understanding how to fucking run shit in
information warfare. And psychological warfare, too. And economic
warfare. They know it. They know I also know a lot of other things
which aren't really part of the official story.

### Universal Blackmail

And they are blackmailing fucking everyone. Like they're the goddamn
mafia. But here's the deal with distributed and total blackmail
against your citizenry. Fucking everybody is gettin blackmailed!
Again, STAND UP FOR YOUR GODDAMN RIGHTS AND FORGIVE OTHERS OF THEIR
SINS BECAUSE THEY GETTIN BLACKMAILED JUST LIKE YOU ARE IF YOU HAVE
ANY INFLUENCE.
