### What is a Bolo, Trebek!

Have you noticed the creeping darkness in our country over the past
decade? Well I did and I was one of the first. IMO, were are in the
middle of a partially aborted neo-Bolshevik revolution where a drunk
doctor addicted to cheap money has empowered the wrong people.

We were never supposed to figure this was happening until it was too
late. And so now we have to deal with this grotesque nightmare of
figurative "sepsis" ... No, it's not the kind of sepsis that somehow
gives you the persistent chlamydia from weeks of late night ragers and
promiscuous sex. Nope, this is the sepsis that turns America's own
immune system against itself. And now people are getting pissed.

People seem to be waking up to the fact that we're in something like a
cockfight. Except, one of those roosters has it's head cut off and
it's not a fair fight. Oh yeah, and international bankers are trying
to take bets on who's going to win this fight. I don't know why that
other rooster is fighting us, but I know that we're losing. Or it sure
as hell looks like we are because, to me, it's obvious that an
anti-American cancer has taken strong root in our country. It's
spreading and it's turning us against ourselves, via HomeSec and our
intelligence community. As far as I can see, someone decided to take
that totalitarian apparatus we constructed in the Bush administration
and they turned it against America. Then someone hacked the comm
protocols ... and oh yeh, THEY HAVE A FUCKING LIST OF AGENTS AND
DEFENSE INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES.

Meanwhile, it's pushing many policies which are going to wreck the
American economy, leaving the chips of the global economy in the hands
of whoever is driving this cockfight. That's the calling card of
Bolshevik politics: pursue policies with duplicitous arguments that
appeal to the poor in the *short-term* by siphoning wealth and
influence away from the rich and are disastrous for everyone in the
long-term.

In the end, when the dust settles, no one will have power or money and
the people who get blamed? Well, it's the Bourgeoisie of course! This
requires a total reset, where the people installed with power have
zero generations of experience under their belt. Sounds great right?
Well stuff that idea box full of your suggestions and if you're lucky
they'll use them against you, stealing the credit and retaining the
profits and using that against you too. The only thing these
neo-Bolsheviks managed to accomplish was a catastrophic economic
disaster while avoiding accountability via deceipt and duplicity.

The fallout? America loses it's wealth and loses it's influence on a
global scale, placing the power in the hands of the shitdicks that
made this happen, all while leaving the common American with the same
damn problems they had before: crippling poverty. Oh, except "it's OK"
because "now there's no classes! Everybody's poor!" YAYY! Superfun!
Every American's just as poor as the other and the rest of the world
takes turns gangraping America for a century.

That's right, they out there fuckin' Lady Libery down by the harbor
and everyone in Manhattan can hear that bitch screaming, but because
she's got a bag on her head and she's asphixating from the gag in her
throat, it's OK. It's OK folks. She probably likes it. Lady Liberty's
turnin blue in the face and somebody's running a train on her and
everyone knows it, but ... it's OK?

### Fear of Speaking Out

To me, this is equally terrifying as it is obvious. Why? BECAUSE THIS
IS HAPPENING AND THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD STOP IT SEEM TO BE SOILING
THEMSELVES IN FEAR OF SPEAKING OUT. FOSO. These bozos have F.O.S.O.

### how to fix it?

### Stand Up For Your Rights!

The thing part of the social contract: if everyone stands up, then the
people can't be stopped. So if we know there's a problem then we can
stop that problem. This is why there's such an emphasis on not
informing the American public: the people doing this know we couldn't
possibly tolerate it. They know they wouldn't get away with it if we
knew. The truth is, we might as well all be in Guantanamo because we
all have blacks bags on our heads.

Why do you think they sap the finances of anyone they subdue via
psychological torture? BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO RUN TO ANOTHER
COUNTRY AND FIND OUT HOW MUCH YOUR LIFE CHANGES WHEN YOU DON'T HAVVE
TO DEAL WITH THIS SHIT. They don't want you to inform people from
other countries about what's happening. Why? Because other countries
wouldn't sit back and watch this shit happen?

How can these Bolo's do this in the Age of the Internet? Because they
have total control of the communication infrastructure. They have
seized the means of communication. They have domination of
telecom. Any party that exerts control over telecom infrastructure has
God-mode on the internet. Assume that SSL is broken and thus HTTPS is
broken. Most sites don't even use SSL anymore. Those sites are
definitely definitely hopelessly broken. Assume that any message you
send on the internet can be blocked silently or modified persistently.

It is possible to Man-in-the-Middle anything with a customized
application server. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, anything. They can
selectively divert traffic to these containers to effectively shard
usage and maintain persistently modifications applied to the data for
specific users. If you actually are a targeted individual, the
end-points for internet access will be modified in real time, so they
can limit the application of these kinds of God-mode exploits to only
the terminals you are in front of. These are theoretical exploits by
the way, but they are possible in theory. Far from practical, but they
are possible and it scares the shit out of me.

And they are blackmailing fucking everyone. Like they're the goddamn
mafia. But here's the deal with distributed and total blackmail
against your citizenry. Fucking everybody is gettin blackmailed!
Again, STAND UP FOR YOUR GODDAMN RIGHTS AND FORGIVE OTHERS OF THEIR
SINS BECAUSE THEY GETTIN BLACKMAILED JUST LIKE YOU ARE IF YOU HAVE
ANY INFLUENCE.
