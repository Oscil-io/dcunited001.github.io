Agency is the capacity for some entity to be considered an independent
actor with the ability to interact on our shared sociophysical
fabric. Agents process information signals from their environment,
which can be conceptualized as sensory input or data. These sensory
perceptions are internalized into information representations.

Entities with agency can analyze and process these to inform its
actions. Agents have a degree of autonomy but do not exist in
isolation. They must have independence and the ability to influence
their environment. They may or may not be self-aware. They may
understand the exact consequences of their actions or may not, but it
is impossible for any entity to fully understand its influence on its
environment, regardless of how self-aware it is.

# [Primary Types of Entities With Agency](#primary-types-of-entities-with-agency)

There are at least three types of a

<a name="sentient-biological-life" />

### (1) [Sentient Biological Life](#sentient-biological-life)

First, there are sentient biological lifeforms: people and animals,
whose degree of awareness varies. These are simply information forms
that exist in systems of molecular dynamics which have evolved degrees
of antifragility.

Primarily, they evolved the ability to self-replicate. Some molecules
implicitly excel in this regard: namely the RNA and DNA. Even better,
these nucleic acids form macromolecules, whose higher level shape
interacts with the environment in functionally significant ways, in
ways no (singular) component of an organic macromolecule can
reproduce. This is what gave specific forms of RNA its evolutionary
advantage in molecular dynamics. It existed in a sea of myriad forms
of RNA, all bending, breaking and crucially self-replicating. The most
advantageous forms prevailed, the ribosome evolved from both RNA and
proteins, which is why it contains parts of both, even today. Pictured
below, tRNA likely resulted from spontaneous chains of nucleotides
complemented the shapes of the amino acids, which gave them some
evolutionary advantage in replication.

So, life is informational. In physics, energy can neither be created
nor destroyed and the same is true for information, which itself
preserves a history of energy distribution and interaction.

<a name="aphysical-autonomous-forms" />

### (2) [Aphysical Autonomous Forms](#aphysical-autonomous-forms)

In the past century, mankind has forged the telecom and computing
infrastructure, a loom onto which virtually instantiated automated
agents are woven. These are simply computer processes, spawned and
bound to physical and virtualized hardware, but they exhibit agency
because they have the capacity to react to and modify their
environment. Even such a minimalistic process should be considered an
entity of agency because their inherent autonomy is exploited to
deflect or defer causal inferences.

In the age of the internet, agents should include even entities as
simple as processes spawned from the command line that running a
network request, analyzing the response, and recording changes to the
file system. Regardless of whether that software process is
deterministic, it can be spawned or signaled by another entity with
agency and controlled. It is important to define such a minimum of
virtualized agency.

Computer software, hardware and networking architecture undergoes
cycles where emergent designs patterns and their anti-patterns drift
into and out of the consciousness of web developers, software
developers and mainframe developers -- but as with all else,
everything old is made anew. The older conceptions of containers of
software agencies -- a la, the linux process -- are better for
extrapolating inferences about upcoming computing trends than whatever
gimmicks du jour are in vogue.

The Docker revolution was about making LXC containers available to the
public, which are glorified means of facilitating declarative resource
distribution while retaining strict access control. LXC, in turn, is
like the Linux answer to BSD Jails and Solaris Containers. These are
all simply entities permitted degrees of autonomy, whose resource
requests (IRQ's) are restricted by the OS. Any of these types of
virtualization can be conceptualized at a high-level by abstracted
away the complexity into a process. The complexity is actually an
illusion. Try telling that to a mainframe programmer whose job has
been phased out via technical skill obscelence.

<a name="physicalized-autonomous-forms" />

### (3) [Physicalized Autonomous Forms](#physicalized-autonomous-forms)

Finally, there are physically-instantiated automated agents: robots,
which are simply the same form of agency with the flexibility of
physical interaction mechanics that makes them functionally distinct.

The latter two agent types proceed through evolutionary stages where
they churn back and forth in the qualities of traits they embody: they
become more physical, more aphysical; the exhibit varied degrees of
autonomy and restricted degrees of autonomy; they perhaps evolve to
some final informational form that transcends time, shedding their
temporality.

<a name="two-unconventional-types-of-entities-with-agency" />

# [Two Unconventional Types of Entities with Agents](#two-unconventional-types-of-entities-with-agency)

There are two unconventional types of agents, whose existence is
certainly debatable. Since they are not materially visible, they are
difficult to define. Still, if you accept biological life as
possessing sentience and agency when we are but
[genetic programs in the chaos of molecular dynamics](te.xel.io/posts/2017-09-14-awareness-precipitates-from-order-out-of-chaos.html),
then don't you have to accept the potential agency of information
forms that exist in other frameworks of chaos?

<a name="sociophysical-and-metaphysical-information-forms" />

### (4) [Sociophysical And Metaphysical Information Forms](#sociophysical-and-metaphysical-information-forms)

The first type includes sociophysical programs and egregores, which
can be dilineated by defining archetypical metaphysical
beings. Another example would include the earth as a lifeform -- the
[Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) --
exhibiting antifragile feedback loops that attempt to placate emergent
turbulence. If such antifragile systems did not mitigate rancorous
economic havoc, what cannot go on forever will not and hence, a dead
planet emerges.

#### Plato, Guarded Eternally By Athena The Wise

![Plato and Athena](/img/posts/2017-10-10-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/plato-and-athena)

These forms of agency seem to contrast the required autonomy and
independence of action. However, according to a holonic understanding
of human and biological life, the system cannot be understood simply
by looking at any single part or set of parts. Instead, a holistic
view of the system is required. Is there any mammal on earth which
does not aid its digestion with other lifeforms? The DNA of these
lifeforms is self-contained; animals have simply loaded a software
library from a genetic programming
[package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager). Therefore,
if many phenomena of biological lifeforms imply we cannot exist in
isolation -- and, a la biosphere, if the exertion of agency is
transformed by information inculcated via nature and nurture -- then
this implies qualities of agency exerted by biological forms are
strongly shaped by the system as a whole.

How different are the sociophysical information forms who lack some
true central container of agency? These forms can also self-replicate,
though their physical center of agency and application of it are both
amorphous. These entities are instead distributed across a virtual
fabric of many host entities. Today, this can include people,
computing and networking infrastructure. Their structure can include
and antifragile, self-healing mechanisms whereby deconstructed
components of the system spread and split like figurative sexual
recombination of information.

#### Shadow DOM, For Great Efficiency In The Web Application Era

![Shadow DOM](/img/posts/2017-10-10-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/shadow-dom.png)

<a name="adumbrated-entities-in-the-shadows-of-the-collective-unconsciousness" />

### (5) [Adumbrated Entities in the Shadows of the Collective Unconsciousness](#adumbrated-entities-in-the-shadows-of-the-collective-unconsciousness)

The second type of unconvential life form includes beings whose
shadows exist as information forms in the collective
unconsciousness. This would include God -- or man's conception of God
-- one such being that emerged from the collective unconsciousness.
How? The concept of monotheistic God represents the nadir of belief
systems: monotheism is the most marketable basis for a belief
system. It is simple to digest, easy to understand and stable. It is
not subject to the same power dynamics as polythestic belief systems.

It's important to distinguish God from both man's inevitable
conception of God and man's actual conception of God. This needs to be
cautiously emphacized: nothing man could create approaches the
infinity of God. Even still, it is rash and potentially offensive to
state this.

The collective unconsciousness certainly exists, but how? And in what
form? If such information forms exist merely as the shadow of sentient
being's conceptions of their environment, can the collective
unconsciousness even possess have certain, definitive schematic
structure? Is it the result of what sentient beings envision; could
envision; could ever envision? Perhaps instead, its structure is also
intrinsically linked to the schematic form of the eternal
metaphysical: that which exists before the physical. Regardless of
whether its schema can be ascertained, what is certain is the power
that enigmatic force exerts on our world.

<!-- *I forced myself to identify a quality translation of Plato's
     work and others; to read them, before any essays or analysis on
     them, because I wanted to start with my own thoughts before being
     exposed to others. Like with all other things I read, it was
     slow, but I invested my time in reflection. Like all my other
     methods of learning, it was inefficient and stupid.* -->

<a name="dilineating-traits-of-entities-with-agency" />

# [Dilineating Traits of Entities With Agency](#dilineating-traits-of-entities-with-agency)

There are several traits shared among all types of entities that exert
agency.

<a name="perception-spectra-range-and-intensity-of-sensory-input" />

### [Perception: Spectra, Range and Intensity of Sensory Input](#perception-spectra-range-and-intensity-of-sensory-input)

What types of input signal can the entity or individual receive and
process? What are the costs in time and energy? Above, in Plato's
Republic, Socrates dilineates the five senses in a phenomenological
analysis. How such analysis must adapt to autonomous artificial
entities is the focus of debate. For these novel autonomous entities,
isn't all input a sense? Then, most of it is informational.

What is the cost to processing such types of sensory input? Vision is
always a hard problem, regardless of whether biological or artificial
hardware is processing the problem.

#### Socrates in [Plato's Republic, Book VI](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.7.vi.html):

> "But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and
> complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever
> contrived?"

In fact, because neural nets usually *functionally approximate*
algorithms, anything the do is inherently less efficient than the most
efficient solutions. Further, as a result of the abstract spectral
range of input, the facets of mind and the qualities of cognition that
arise are peculiar and idiosyncratic.

### [Identity: Comparability, Precision and Uniqueness](#identity-comparability-precision-and-uniqueness)

When we leverage these differences provided by diversity of body, mind
and culture, this is a strength. Our individual (shapes) are cast by
variety of life experience, and this allows us fill in each other's
gaps. We have to remember this. I take Nietzsche's philosophy about
the ubermensch seriously -- yet, this does not mean that one type of
individual is greater than another -- each of us has potential for
greatness in our own way. Unrestrained, we collectively have the most
potential to do the most good for others.

#### The Normal Distribution

![Picture of bell curve](/img/posts/2017-10-10-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/bell-curve.svg)

Those who study intelligence try to conceptualize IQ as
[Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
with an average -- but what they forget is that the divergent
individuals are all divergent in their own way. Can you average
apples, oranges, kiwis and dragonfruit? Further, we also forget that
we are running on the same biological hardware -- it is our experience
and the way we react to it that forms our mind. *If you ever believe
anything else, you have ceded control to fate or some force that seeks
to control you by convincing you that you are less than the radiant,
stellar being you were meant to be.*

One can replace vacuous desolation with verdant providence through
self-directed, larmarkian transformation of the individual, fueled by
sheer force of will and fantastical epigenetic mechanisms, whose power
transcends that of genetics. Why would we believe in limitations?
Believe in transcendence of those limitations; albeit irrational, the
power of mystery is sometimes our only hope.

The idea that you would compare the form of agents stems from math. It
is especially applicable to virtualized information forms: processes
are recognized by name, source code, or memory contents; antivirus
software operates by recognizing potentially malicious instruction
sets. Hashing algorithms enable digitally sign software to be
efficiently recognized and trusted. There are many ways to recognize
the same program that runs on different hardware. This is especially
relevant for the second and third types of agency.

For biological agents, it is impossible to compare two people --
further, the application of this idea can lead towards dangerous
ideas. People tomorrow are always meant to be more than what they
where today. We are meant to grow and to never stop growing. We are
meant to plant these same seeds of inspiration in others at every
chance possible. We are meant to tend the soil of society, so that it
is more fertile for transformation and self-actualization.

<a name="autonomy-sentience-direction-and-will" />

### [Autonomy: Sentience, Direction and Will](#autonomy-sentience-direction-and-will)

- sentience is awareness of an experience of sensory phenomena
  - cognizance of that awareness is not required

  - will for action applied to an objective
    - how to state this in a generalized way?
    - there are degrees of variation here:
      - people choose their own goals, or at least believe they do
      - automated agents will eventually attain this

- direction: purpose, intent and goal
  - pheramone signaling in ants as protocols for the chemical
    transmission of information
  - for ants to attain progress in this direction, the biological
    components must incentivize this progress
    - the minds of all sentient beings facilitate expansion in
      capacity for analysis and synthesis of internalized information.
  - this is a kind of decentralized program, with biological and
    sociophysical components. common behavior patterns emerge in ant
    colonies tightly coupled to their adjecent environment and
    specifically the physical idiosyncrasies in their local
    environment. (reword this)
    - is the ant hill in the middle of African sahara or in a
      rainforest?
    - is the ant hill centered beside a McDonalds or a candy store?
    - the environment will sociophysically distort the ants social
      behavior: they will be attracted to further food sources with
      stronger signal.

  - consciousness is a spectrum. spontaneous insight provokes
    transcendence into higher forms of awareness. with greater and
    varied (capacity) for sentience, sensory input, analysis,
    synthesis and reflection, these spontaneous insights become more
    frequent.
    - humanity's own sociophysical programs may seem more complicated,
      but we are not unlike the ants, whose social behavior is so
      profoundly affected by their environment.
    - through tools like discernment, intuition and reflection, some
      of us find ourselves free of the environment's imposition,
      distortion and containment.
    - how do individuals become aware of the higher goals? how does
      humanity become aware of the highest goal?

- can we know it without seeing it? can we see it even if we know it?
  - if we are fortunate enough that a virtuous path becomes
    illuminated at our feet, what does it (take/cost) to follow it?
    - [where does it lead](/posts/2016-05-14-oneironautics-questing-for-lucidity.html#forging-a-path-home)?
    - isn't it simpler to follow when our light reflects off one
      another?
- We channel our spirit with the mind's (internalized understanding)
  of life and this goal.

Though we may seem greater, if the greats who came before us were
truly the greatest and this path becomes occluded, what then?

In the future, we'll forget creativity's eminence. It won't be
something we realize we miss once it's gone. The path from whence we
came will be hidden and inconstructible. Adumbrating sensory overload
will occlude our path, if we even think to look for it.

<a name="agency-boundaries-permeability-and-maniability" />

### [Agency: Boundaries, Permeability and Maniability](#agency-boundaries-permeability-and-maniability)

(Interface with the External World)

- life on the sun? (plasma-based life forms in the chaos of the
  magnetohydrodynamic systems of plasma)
  - or some other entity with endless capacity/bandwidth for to
    analyze/synthesize information, but little to no means of reaching
    back



- as communication infrastructure provides the foundation for
  metaphysical precipitation, boundaries dissolve, permeability widens
  the (opening) in the veils that part us.
  - information omnipresence is only restrained by the degree and
    voracity of its own deluge
  - thus, we begin to converge:
    - our capacity for agency grows and we all become superempowered
      beings who share limitations on both our computational capacity
      and natural bounds on energy consumption.
    - the space between us dissolves. the speciation of information
      increases, but antifragile systems require some artificial
      constraints on spectral decoherence. therefore, there will be
      paradoxical trends of both coherence and decoherence. we must
      struggle to retain a sense of our humanity and identity or we
      lose the capacity to grow stronger, both individually and
      together. Notwithstanding our (need for memory of our humanity),
      we will all quite literally become one. If the information (that
      determines our) metaphysical identity wasn't hopelessly
      intractible, we could measure, analyze, synthesize and know
      this.
