What makes a person like Elon Musk or Steve Jobs so effective at
reaching their dreams?
What qualities, behaviors, experience and knowledge contribute most to
building their character, realizing their dreams and pushing them
forward, in spite of hardship?  What attributes contribute to the
development of these qualities and behaviors? Why are these attributes
important?

What kinds of knowledge help us form and realize a vision? What
knowledge catalyzes the development of such a vision?  What inspires
others to work with us?

!["Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." - Steve Jobs](/img/posts/2016-01-03-facets-of-greatness/steve-jobs-stay-hungry-stay-foolish.jpg)

Where is it that most people learn to be great?  It's their father
that first imbues that image.  Perhaps their mother as well.
Unfortunately, I never had a father.  He died when I was 14 months
old.  You might say the world acted as my fater, or tried to help as
much as it could anyway. So, instead of a singular impression or image
of what it means to be a great person, I ended up with several.  Yet,
the combination of these impressions were far weaker than that most
receive from their father.  So as I began my 3rd decade of life, I
found myself lacking direction and instead I felt a hole that needed
to be filled.  I was forced to search hard for meaning in life, but
there was nothing there, nothing real anyways.  I eventually found
that I needed to create my own meaning in life.

So this series is a reflection on what I've learned. I didn't have
much of a clearly stated system given to me by my parents.  I had to
create my own, which is by no means complete.

- also, this article isn't really mean to be a consummate dissertation (?)
  on the topics contained herein.  these ideas aren't really "pure"
  and really need to be distilled if a system based on these ideas
  were to be pure.  That is, many of these facets overlap and I don't
  believe this is the ideal way to structure this content.

But even in a premature form, I believe that some of these tools will
be invaluable in protecting that which is close to you from what is
coming.

### The Surface Surrounding the Intangible

In this series, I'm trying to explain concepts that involve
characteristics which cannot really be explained at all. They are much
deeper than that.  And so, these facets are like the faces on the
surface of this abstract, ineffable thing. [elaborate]

I really hope that by explaining these facets, I make it easier for
others to relate to the intangible truth to becoming great which so
often eludes the majority of us.  Most give up on pursuing this path
before we know it exists and by the time we see it, it's too
late. You'll find in life that there are many people out there with
advice for you, but truly, their advice is meant to make you useful to
them, while providing enough value to seem authentic.

Instead, I hope to arm you with most of the knowledge and advice that
I would give myself.  A good rule of thumb for ethical action in any
case and especially when giving advice to someone is the golden rule:
treat your neighbor as you'd treat yourself.  Or, more radically:

> Treat everyone else as though they literally are you. As though we
> are all one. That, by harming another, you are harming yourself.

![Treat Yo'self!]

And the Golden Rule's corollary of course: treat yourself as you'd
like others to treat you.  I've said it time and time again.

> Your confidence is your most valuable asset and you better know that
> people will try to steal that too.

By assaulting your confidence, you'll find that negative people not
only boost theirs, but they do so at your expense, by subjugating you
through demoralization.  You've been warned!

## The Facets of Greatness

### Quantification

Great people quantify and measure everything.  Without quantification,
you cannot develop a system or hope to improve.  The most difficult or
seemingly ineffable is usually the most valuable to form a system for
quantification.  Since it's difficult, it confers advantage when you
can measure and predict that which mystifies others. It's especially
crucial to learn how to measure your usage of time, as well as those
around you.  You also need to learn to quantify information,
knowledge, communication and social networking -- both online and IRL.

### Communication

These great leaders are all conductors in the symphony of
communication.  They identify the most efficient means to relay
messages, so that they can interfaces with a tree of people in their
own organization as well as with people in others.  Everyone has
twenty-four hours in a day.  The best leaders network with power
players who command their own subtree of the organization and, by
doing so, harness the sum of man-hours available to their network for
maximum efficiency.

### Signaling

Everything around you is part of a myriad of systems, composed of
countless feedback loops.  Signaling concerns becoming aware of how
your organization's words and actions will implicitly and explicitly
affect those feedback loops.  Signaling is a kind of indirect
communication, but it is communication.

### Knowledge

- knowledge drives how you see a system compared to how others see the
  same system.  the difference between your model and that of others
  determines your belief that there is opportunity where others see
  only risk.  this can also help you determine how to mitigate risk.
- need a better, more descriptive summary here.

### Vision

### Story

- people love a good story
  - there's always something to be learned
  - you can make your brand, your identify more relatable
  - your story sometimes drives your vision
    - and helps other people understand the why behind your vision
- southwest airlines and the cocktail napkin
- the steve jobs story

### Identity

vision, story and identity as aspects of the same thing
- vision is your anticipated destination in the future
  - your story helps define where you came from
  - your identity relates to how you and your organization are
    perceived now


### Orchestration

- strategy-
- merge with legal system?

## How to Break Through

I see many of these qualities in}yself, though I fear it's too late.
Becoming great and freeing yourself from the chains of a "normal" life
is quite rare.  You'll find that it often requires the coordination of
one or two previous generations for someone to really "break through."
Does it require being born into the aristocracy or the upper middle
class? No. Does it require access to a network of the rich and famous?
No. A serendipitous opportunity, perhaps divined by fate? No, though
the best of us will make the most of our luck and those situations
which are truly once in a lifetime.

So what does it mean to break through and what does it take? It really
is quite rare. I'm talking about the success that is quite often 1 in
100,000. You'll find that people born into wealthy circumstances can
be quite stunted in their development. And, similarly that those born
into poverty often lack the resources or opportunities to develop.
It's expensive to be poor.  That is true.

Instead, I view this as a kind of natural selection for
psychology. It's the people who have the perfect mashup of ideas and
behaviors in their minds who become wildly successful. It's the people
who have the perfect mix of positives, without the wrong kind of
negatives who end up breaking through. The meme's and ideas that
develop in these people's minds, coupled with the perfect timing and
just the right combination of serendipitous (*) events results in a
mind that responds to more effectively extract the positives out of a
situation without being restrained by the negatives. It's one that,
coupled with the guidance of others, perfectly creates fertile
situations in front of them.

So, what's the most important factor in creating the perfect artist
and business minds?  IMO, it's the structure of the minds of their
parents and how the parents raise their child.  Often, you'll look at
someone's life and see that not only did the previous generation
affect their upbringing, but the generation before that as well.
Obviously, this is something that *can* be easier to provide for
affluent families, but wealth is absolutely not required and usually
you'll find that it hurts.  Instead, families that have struggled for
a generation or two will develop a perspective and outlook on life,
coupled with strategies for self-actualization and propagating that
knowledge, which all contribute greatly towards success in this
"natural selection" of "ideal" psychology.

And the most important point for me to stress here is that there are
sooo many small mistakes someone can make that result in massive risks
or costs to someone's career.  The seeds for your career start when
you are young and every moment matters, whether you realize that at
the time or not.  There are some early behaviors, beliefs or actions
-- which usually require high maturity or a parent's guidance or
interference -- and these can either make you or break you.  My point
is that it's usually impossible for most people to comprehend these
unspoken "rules" *at any point in their life*, much less between
15-25, which are really the critical years.  And so, they either don't
approach life with these goals in mind and miss the opportunity or
they break these "rules" and unknowingly lose the opportunity.

However, it's important for me to state that there is not a singular
"ideal" psychology and, in fact, you'll find that this kind of great
success is often an ironic curse.  It can bear a terrible price and
one might struggle for it, never to acheive it. Or struggle for it in
vain without realizing they'd already committed too many mistakes. For
me, I've been so stubborn and singularly focused on building a
product, refusing to give up, that I've nearly destroyed my life.

One factor hoding America back is the waning influence that the family
has in building the next generation.  We spend almost no time
together.  There are fewer conversations and fewer family dinners.
Alas, that's the subject for another post.

## Learn From the Fool

### If You Are Wise

Instead, let's look at some of the largest factors which could prevent
someone from attaining greatness.  And then I'll describe a few of my
mistakes.  I'm really not going to cover everything though.

> "Fools learn from experience.  I prefer to learn from the experience
> of others." - Otto von Bismarck

Please, keep in mind that I believe that many of these ideals go
against my own ideas of what it means to be a virtuous person.  I
can't stand playing to appearances or adhering to many of the other
so-called
[Laws of Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power).
It's a book that I detest by the way -- the wikipedia article notes
it's significance to prison inmates -- but it's a book that is very
worth reading if you want to defend yourself against its
tactics. Please keep that in mind.

> friendship itself.  You've been warned.

### Guard Your Reputation With Your Life

(rewrite?)

What does one need to avoid?  Since becoming great requires a lot of
exposure and often courting someone's attention who would, in a way,
vouch for you, then you need to guard your reputation as though it
were your life.  Your reputation is like a kind of currency, which you
can accrue over time or you can squander in a moment.  For me, I
picked drug legalization, one of the worst causes for my reputation,
as it led to soooo many doors being slammed in my face, though I can't
say I regret supporting ending the War on Drugs.

### Keep Your Circle Tight

Getting that big break often requires getting the approval of other,
already successful people who equally (desire?) their reputation and
their already secured position.  These people will want to vet anyone
that gets close to them.  They have a set of friends who have proven
their trustworthiness and they're wary of letting people in.

Similarly, you need to keep your circle tight.  While new people can
sometimes bring opportunity, they often come bearing baggage or rotten
fruit. Especially if you don't vet them.  This is another great
ability to develop: you need to be able to quickly run people through
a gambit and understand how they're going to react in various similar
future situations (?).  All while appearing approachable and
non-judgemental.

(this is something my family probably should have taught me, but kind
of left out... then again, it's my experiences that have made me who i
am today, but that probably wasn't the intent)

All of this contrasts my own values (to a greater degree in the past)
because I like being exposed to all kinds of people, regardless of
weather they would be positive or negative -- mostly because i want to
learn about them.  Isolation also bears a cost and if you're always
around people you've carefully chosen, can you really say that you
"know" people?  Honestly, living life in such a guarded, cautious
manner -- is it really worth it?

Then again, if you've made so many sacrifices already in your life and
you've remained calculated and guarded for so long, are you really
willing to bring someone in who could disrupt that?

## In summary

Many people I know scoff at my attempts to build a product.  Some of
them laugh at my ideas; some will point towards my reputation or
perceived weaknesses or past failures; others will claim that I don't
have the communication skills.  But almost no one has tried to team up
with me.  For the few that have, it just seems that our circumstances
don't happen to line up at that time.  Thank you anyways.

But, for my detractors:

> If someone asked you to write 15,000 words on the factors, traits,
> events and conditions required to develop mastery of leadership,
> what would you write?  If someone asked you to speak for three hours
> on the subject, what arguments would you make?  What historical
> allegories would you choose to illustrate your points?  What would
> others say in response?

While my words are far from eloquent and while I'm far from perfect
myself, how long are people going to try to claim that I don't know
what I'm talking about or that I'm mentally insane? Honestly?
... *Fuck you*.

In other words, a leader who finds it difficult influence others, for
whatever reason, is not really a leader.  What is incredibly
frustrating is when this difficulty arises from the **interference**
of others.  And it really just comes with the territory.  Power is
alluring and you'll find that others want it and sometimes they don't
want you to have it.  But when you realize that, for a decade, people
have been subtly undercutting you and assaulting your reputation and
trying their damnedest to prevent you from amounting to someone with
influence -- you'll find this to be quite angering.  Especially if
you've made a ton of sacrifices to retain your personal definition of
ethics or morality.

Anyway, not one person has contributed more than an hour *with me* to any
product idea I've had.  For all my viable business ideas and all my
quirky tech ideas too, I have not been able to identify a single
person who seems to want to be a cofounder.  Much of this is my fault,
for not networking enough and spending 100% of my available time
programming instead of finding a team with which i could delegate
responsibility.

Again, I see some of these qualities in myself.  Many of them, I
observed and learned too late, as I've already made far too many
mistakes.  However, I believe that others can draw on the experience
of your mistakes.  And that if the experiences of these problems are
shared, instead of covered up and hidden, people can greatly benefit
from that.  Even when many of those problems may be embarrassing or
expose personal vulnerability.

### Vulnerability

Vulnerability, especially when visible -- does its mere presence and
visibility imply weakness in great people?  If we always hide our
vulnerabilities, how can we teach those we care about what to hide and
what to show and how to talk to people about problems and who to trust
about them?  If appearance trumps reality, then is it worse to have a
perceived vulnerability or an actual one?  How does one's own
awareness of them change things?  And when is it ethical to lead
others into believing someone possessess some weakness like this?

The intention behind this matters, but I've found time and time again
that if someone really cares about you, then they will let you know
about it.  If they're trying to score political points in the office,
then they won't involve you when calling attention to your
vulnerabilities. IMO, it's tragic that we would end up with this kind
of culture in the workplace... If someone only seeks to exploit their
coworkers vulnerabilities to score political points and greater
influence in their local workspace -- instead of working with their
colleague to address and improve them -- then doesn't that leave us
all more vulnerable as a group?  That'd imply that some negative
political behavior in the workplace is not only abbrasive, but
corrosive.  And without the proper systems in place to keep this
behavior in check, the wrong people rise to the top employing shady,
opportunistic tactics while simultaneously leaving groups in various
social strata much more vulnerable, in aggregate.

Also, if it's important to learn from these people by examining their
biographies and lives, so we can grow from their experiences, then
doesn't the distortion of reality and the total obliviation of these
flaws detract from what we'd otherwise learn? If so many biographies
are written posthumously -- and if these people live their lives
seeking to hide their weaknesses and call attention to their strengths
-- then how can we hope we'll capture the truth at all?  Obviously, as
with everything else, the right answer lies somewhere in the
middle. IMO, we should focus on telling those stories that can help us
all grow.  And I believe the solution to addressing our
vulnerabilities lies in cultivating self-awareness, so that we are not
dependent on someone else being respectful and tactful enough to help
us address them in the right way.  And self-awareness is something
I'll discuss in the section on identity and image.

- the fate of Tartarus. maybe just a picture.

As for me personally, are these lessons a blessing or a curse? Only
after a decade of painful mistakes did I learn any of this. I'm never
sure whether my stubbornness is a positive or negative trait, but it's
only by refusing to give up did I ever learn any of this.  Everyone
around me -- my friends and family -- wanted me to give up or just get
a job and be distracted. Maybe they were really thinking of my best
interest -- it's nearly destroyed me.  And the ambition required to
pursue a path like this ends up fostering attachment in me that should
not otherwise exist.  If I didn't desire success and greatness out of
a belief that, properly postured, I could truly benefit the world, the
I wouldn't want it at all.

### Part Two:

## Quantification

I'll discuss quantification and its importance in the next section,
describes a few examples of how accurate methods of measurement lead
individuals to attain insurmountable advantage in their industry or
culture.
