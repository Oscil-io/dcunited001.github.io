Just to clarify right at the start: I support Trump for president. I
think the guy has some great ideas, though admittedly I had a hard
time supporting him until early 2016. The reason I support him is
because we're embarking on a transitionary period and need fresh
policies. (restructure this)

- important to know the hows of the system
  - and important to know the why's
  - need to have an appreciation of the why and the tradition behind
    these things
    - if for nothing else, you have to understand it to change it.

Washington seems gridlocked on so many issues. This isn't a bug; it's
a feature. In part, this is how the system was designed by the
founders. They wanted a system where there would be two parties that
would need to vie for power. Our system differs from most republics
and democracies across the world. Our parties don't form
coalitions. Further, our bicameral system with a House and Senate is
another aspect to the Legislative branch that slows down rapid reform.
And most of all, the system of commitees requires that any laws
receive a ton of discussion before hitting the floor, so they are well
vetted by congressmen who are familiar with the issues they
revolve. But this can stall out quick change.

This friction actually promotes stability in the long term. It makes a
republic less susceptible to foreign influence, one of the biggest
weaknesses of a democratic government with fairly open borders. This
also prevents wild changes in policy implementations, were we ever to
have a fickle populace. Frequent fluctuations and reversals in policy
means that our economy, it's businesses and industries don't have time
to adapt. Reforms are expensive, regardless of who supports them and
regardless of whether they are justified and beneficial in the
longterm. They are expensive in terms of implementation and in the
cost to the economy. Businesses need to be able to project and prepare
for policy changes.

### Reform requires a movement (title)

Higher cost to reforms means that the people who want it most end up
winning. To change something in this country, you have to get popular
support, especially if a policy is contrary to special interests.

That means you have to build a movement. How do you build a movement?
you relate to people. You figure out how to connect to them. You get
them emotionally invested in something. If something else is more
important, then they'll gravitate towards that. But when people are
emotionally and financially invested, they care. They pay attention to
the news, the laws, the policies and the political games in
washington.

And what happens then? Smarter, well-researched policies
... generally.

(maybe remove) In the Nineties and Aughties, there were just too many
people who weren't paying attention. Because, for the most part, it
all felt good. Why? Cheap credit provided plenty of liquidity for the
economy. Cheap credit leads to misallocation of resources. We weren't
really aware there were problems or if we were, we didn't know why. We
weren't reading the signals.

Keynesian economics are great for promoting stability and resilience
against minor issues, but the drawback to cheap credit is that we can
numb ourselves against the pain we should feel that would force us to
change. Just to be clear, we need Keynesian policies and we need the
Fed. A stable economy means more accurate projections and anticipation
of trends.

### Economic Effects of Election Outcome

Ever heard that the outcome of the presidential election affects the
economy? Policy & platform aside, does that mean that one president
would lead to a better economy and the other would lead to a worse
economy? Not really and again, that is a general statement which
doesn't take specific platform issues into account. However, the
outcome will always help some industries and hurt others. So it
doesn't imply a simple "growth" or "loss" of the economy as it implies
a shift of influence between various industries and businesses.

Once you take the specific platform issues and realistic policy
changes into account, then yes! there is a significant difference
between candidates. That guy gets to run the executive branch of the
US Government. You bet your ass one candidate is going to better than
the other.

And just real quick, here's the deal with socialism: it's fucking
great! It's amazing! Right until your coffers dry up and you can't
fund your services. How you gonna do fund services without liquidity
to pay for them? Something like that wouldn't happen all at once, but
generally it does. And it's verrrry verry sneaky. It occurs on the
timescale of generations; not years, not election cycles.

Are there problems? Yes! The prices in the US economy are generally
out of control and have been for years. This is tough if you don't
make much money. But this technological shift? Costs and prices are
going to drop. Longstanding economic assumptions will be challenged
and broken. It hasn't happened yet. It's not going to happen
overnight. But it will happen. And they're going to have to rewrite
the college economics textbooks for Micro and Macro.

It can be difficult to relay the context of policy decisions to
average americans and then retain strategic advantage in the global
marketplace. China is mostly a closed country and they have so many
advantages in this regard. We just let people walk on over. I'm going
to write an article on illegal immigration very soon. This is mostly a
national security issue and it's a long-term problem. Again, it's
sinister in that it's not a big enough issue to tackle, so no one
does. The consequences are easier to deal with if we make tough
decisions now. The tensions are worse if we keep waiting.

### We Need Well-Research Policy

#### .. Tectonic Cultural Shift

There's a lot of change getting ready to go down in the whole
world. If you've been living under a rock, it stems from technology
and the tectonic cultural shift that's occuring. There are problems
with this. It's not going to be easy. and it's going to be fast. If we
do not nail it right, we're going to lose. Not everything, but we'll
lose pretty big. This isn't a high-probability risk, but it would be a
costly one. So we need to be prepared.

So, as much as I detest the Citizen's United decision, this is
actually one reason that there should be a lot of money in Washington
... for now! *Just hear me out!*

We need people who are well paid to research policy. And if you've
noticed, neither the Republicans nor the Democrats seem to want to do
much about it, as much as the people on both sides hate it. Why's
that? Both parties are sucking that teet. They are both gulping down
that cash. In part, it helps drive Washington.

Way too much money in politics is usually a bad thing. It leads to
corruption and bad decisions. I don't like Super PAC's for many
reasons. I detest them, actually. I can't stand money in politics. I
admire politicians who abstain from particular funding sources, like
Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders. And yes, Donald Trump, too. I can't
recall if he changed direction, but he didn't accept very much
money. And ya damn straight. Money comes with strings. Your grandma
might have given you money out of the goodness of her heart, but not
that lobbyist.

But right now, we need smart people in Washington getting paid good
money to research policy. And we need a lot of those people in the
system. Again, for now...

### Designed with Change in Mind

The country's systems were designed to anticipate centuries of change!
Centuries! The founders fully expected large changes in policy and
public sentiment after the founding of our country. And they did all
over the course of a hot summer in Pennsylvania. With no
air-conditioning.

The Articles of Confederation may have been a more idealistic
government, but let's be serious here: do you really think they
intended that to last? Not really. It was good enough. Good enough to
give our founders about a decade to figure out what would be great
enough to last centuries. That's what I mean. Yeh, Thomas Jefferson
might have wanted the Articles to last. It didn't have the power or
mechanism to tax states. That's like asking the Red Cross to run your
government.

But this is what I mean: they knew it was going to play out like
that. And what would you do? They just fought a revolution. Things are
tumultuous and tensions with the British are fierce. Do you think
Britain was going to play nice with foreign policy? No. They were
going to be subversive, I imagine. So if you have a temporary
government declared as the official thing, it gives you time to think
of the right policies worth fighting for and an opportunity to see how
the other side of the Atlantic is going to play.

Like Guiness, it's brilliant! And, IMO, this same foresight is evident
in the Constitution and Bill of Rights on the scale of centuries.

### Game Design (Blizzard)

This reminds me of Blizzard's excellent game design. Yes, Blizzard
games. As in, Warcraft, Diablo and Starcraft. Their games are known
for impeccable balance and for retaining communities of gamers for a
decade or longer. And why?

Anticipation of strategy and metagame trends is what makes Blizzard
games last for decades. I've noticed that it seems they anticipated
not only the game balance, but the metagame balance and transitions.
They seemed to understand how the strategies would change as they
released minor changes in patches. This means that they did a
ridiculous amount of play-testing for various settings.

I'm giving Blizzard a ton of credit here, but there's a reason their
titles are amoung the most popular in professional gaming. They
anticipated the long-term evolution and *that* is why they were
successful. Instead of nailing down a single "balanced" game
configuraion, they tested Starcraft strategies under different
settings. Through play-testing, they learned which ones would be
dominant as they made minor changes.

From here, they understood how to optimally transition from one set of
dominant strategies to another. This allowed Blizzard to slightly tilt
the online game balance. In Starcraft, this means a few strategies
will become favored and others will become tougher bets. That makes
things interesting for different classes of players. Some strategies
may see little to no gameplay, but are suddenly popular after a patch
because slight changes make them practical.

Blizzard understood how to optimally balance Starcraft for games from
two to eight players with three races. That's impressive. Not only
that, but they seem to have play-tested so well they understood the
optimal transition in patches. This means they could phase dominant
strategies in and out.

This has a ton of difficult-to-predict but valuable effects that
enabled Blizzard to retain gamer loyalty, even over shiny new products
from competitors. It's part of a corporate strategy to grow a loyal
community around their games. Blizzard can tweak the game and drive
trends in pro play. *This* keeps metagame interesting for
professionals. *That* requires gamers to invest time and energy in
keeping up with trends in the gaming world. They have to discuss this
stuff in forums.

That investment? It means that players will feel committed to blizzard
titles. That discussion for metagame? It also drives SEO while
simultaneously fostering a community around their titles. If the
settings were fairly constant and gameplay strategies were stable, the
game would age more quickly and the adaptation would require
discussion.

### Sidenote on personal success

- click [here]() if you'd like to skip. lulz

Sidenote: yes, i've made less than 30% of the aggregate income that I
should have over the past few years, mostly to pursue startup
ideas. But if you haven't figured it out yet, just because I haven't
had spectacular success doesn't mean I'm an idiot. The crap I've dealt
with from specific people I worked with (less than five people) has
been a serious setback, for which I have no one to hold
accountable.

But that doesn't mean I'm a failure. If you associate success with
riches -- or with the appearance of money! -- then you should reassess
the way you look at people. Being rich is not the same as being
wealthy. I've been through a lot, but I know my shit. I assess
businesses and their strategies all the time. I cannot help it. I read
about founders and their lives. And it is so irritating to have NEVER
had the chance even once to build a product with a team. Not even
once! It's like it's against the law to cofound a company with
me. You'd have to be a moron to pass up an opportunity to found an
music app like [Splice](https://splice.com)!

One reason why I have never had the chance is because I've never had
an opportunity. I can't say I've failed even though I spent almost
five years of my life on this! Because I've never really tried! And
there are negative people who know that I would be successful. The
people around me are not stupid. They know that once I got my first
success, I would fucking multiply that shit. And after I multiplied
it, I would exponentiate it.

I intuitively understand politics and business strategy for parent
companies and their subsidiaries, though I'm sure I have blind
spots. I know what it means to own competitors to dominate market
share. The fact that I barely have two quarters to rub together is
bullshit and everyone in this country knows it. I couldn't buy coffee
the other day because I only had five quarters. I didn't have seven
quarters... And I didn't feel like walking home.

Can I have some first world problems?! Or do I live in Mali? I made
$1,717 in 2015. Yes. Yes, that number has FOUR fucking digits ... So
yes, I feel like I deserve to bitch about it. After May, I worked hard
to not make any money in 2015, just so I could put the lowest number
possible on my tax. JUST SO I COULD BITCH ABOUT IT. So I will.

And how is it that I can help so many other people, yet have nothing
myself? What the fuck is that, anyways? Moving on...

### Distribution of power across generations

So anyways, preventing rapid change is normally a good thing, though
not with the upcoming tectonic cultural shift. The power in a republic
should be distributed across the generations, but the people that make
the most critical decisions should be the more senior
generations. This is the subject for another post, but there are just
some things that you won't understand until you have experienced
them. You won't get it.

### Washington is tough for an outsider

All of this got me thinking about politics in Washington. Yes, Trump
is an outsider. He's a very successful businessman. The guy knows how
to strategize, leverage his network and orchestrate people to build
success. And there's no doubt he's connected with a large network of
people, but Washington DC has a politically oriented network. While
Trump has strong connections in DC, it's not the same thing as having
worked in DC for decades.

#### Integrating with Power Structures in Washington

Political outsiders would likely face some difficulty integrating with
existing power structures in DC. Some heavily invested businesspeople
would run into conflicts of interest. They know that. You don't just
wing it in Washington.

#### Politics is about Appearances

However, politics is about appearances. You'll find situations twisted
against you, just because it seems believable. It's not a good idea to
do something just because you can. Hopefully people are reasonable
about this, but it gets dirty quick. If he wins, Trump needs to assert
leadership early because of the political climate. If it were me, I'd
be looking for people to use as examples to assert leadership so other
people get the picture. I'd make it known that I want examples. And
people are going to want to test out those waters. Go ahead.

#### Minimizing Conflicts of Interest

To minimize surface area for people to attack, some divestment would
be worthwhile because if you no longer have your assets & investments,
then you can't be said to be influenced by them. At least it's not so
easy.

As much as people like to accuse politicians of scheming to get rich,
career politicians will stay away from large investments, especially
conflicts of interest. General rule: politicians don't mix well with
active business ventures, which also means that you are better off to
forego opportunities while in politics. If you're a career politician,
more valuable to forego large investments. Investments in some
industries are riskier than others, like those that allocate extensive
resources towards lobbying.

Besides divestment, another option is to restructure your assets and
investments. You can't be expected to run a business while obligated
to the duties of federal office. It'd be difficult to say the
least. If you can't divest, then your best bet, if you can't divest,
is to find someone to manage these investments for you. This sucks
because you have to trust that person to not fuck you over.

E.G. If that person puts you in the position where you can't be seen
having profited by visibly correcting this person's mistakes. they
could make a series of subtly bad management decisions, which you
wouldn't have had time to see, giving them some advantage. They could
mismanage, dropping the stock price temporarily, allowing them to
attempt to skim ownership of the company, in an opportunistic
manner. Anyone who would mismanage for an advantage? Send 'em to the
moon. An oddly specific scenario and not likely, but I can imagine
that there would be other scenarios that'd be hard to see. More to the
point, any problems that arise would distract from your duties. But,
if you have significant assets, then you probably already have people
you trust who help you run the show.

In general, assets like real estate are less risky than active
business ventures. Assets aren't free: they require taxes and
upkeep.

### Personal Political Transition

For me, money is useful as it permits me the influence to exert for
change. That's it. That's the only reason i've wanted money. That's
the whole fucking reason I was chasing it all this time! I saw
problems with the world. I wanted to fix them and I felt
powerless. Around 2005, I decided I'd have to get money. Around 2007,
I discovered apps were a possibility, but I was distracted with
skating and petty drama. But I knew that if I wanted to change things,
I needed money and a lot of it. Around 2011, I discovered that I
didn't want anything else, but the ability to attain the influence to
change things. I became single-minded and decided nothing else was
worth it.

This stubbornness was borne out of passion for particular issues. I
saw that things could be better; they should be better. And I was
infuriated with the lack of progress on particular problems. Around
summer 2007, I discovered Ron Paul and if it weren't for that I might
still be liberal. I voted for Nader in 2004. That's how liberal I was.
I thought Chavez was a great guy. He paid the heating bill for people
in the Bronx! A leader from Venezuela gave to random people in New
York City. Out of the goodness of his heart! That's how liberal I was.

- describe problems i was/am passionate about?

- many of our problems are symptoms of deeper problems
  - many of these are cultural
    - to improve these, we need to focus on education
    - but it's not going to be overnight

- mention that I know what it feels like to struggle

I wisened up after 2007 and became more conservative, but I was still
passionate about many of the same problems as the left. Actually, I
discovered that both the left and the right were concerned about
mostly the same problems, but they had different answers. I refused to
give in on social issues and I'm still socially liberal. IMO, those
are mostly issues to be addressed by the family and by cultural
institutions. Yet, many of those cultural institutions have been
weakened.

I'm pretty steadfast fiscally conservative. I've never received
unemployment or welfare or a check from the government outside of my
income taxes, when I got still got a check. I still owed taxes from
2014, but for some reason, it had been real hard to find a job. So, I
gave up finding a job in 2015 after about May. I'd make as little
money as possible and just let my 2015 tax return cancel out my 2014
taxes. Fuck 'em. If I'd gotten another job, I'd have been harrassed
like I was at almost every real job I've had. Fuck 'em!

#### Can't win? Play another game!

I've been unemployed for a long time, but that doesn't mean I haven't
been working hard. I took advantage of all the resources available
online. Wikipedia, Coursera and all the other brilliant ways to
learn. Yeh, the economy has been tough and the distribution of wealth
has been shifted towards the wealthy. The dissipation of the middle
class is a serious problem. Yet, there has never been another time in
history were the poor have more opportunities. No, this doesn't work
for everyone, but for many people & especially young people, *you have
never been as empowered as you are now! In history!*

## Congressional Networks

Between the House and the Senate, there are 435 Representatives and
100 Senators, but this isn't the only way to group these people.  As I
tend to do, I found a mathematic analogy. Higher level math is useful
because it has so many parallels with real life. In fact, to master
real life, you have to learn these tools, whether you realize it or
not. And this is a great example of learning to view your personal
networks from several perspectives.

Members of congressmen and faculty on Capitol Hill can be recomposed
into various views, including by officially defined groups like
committees and less explicit affiliations. The house and senate can be
divided into leadership, administrators and general congressmen. You
can further organize this view via seniority, political influence or
on some other dimension. These groups can be reorganized into groups
that satisfy some functional objective. E.G. all senators who have
served 12+ years or all representatives who've served 6+
years. There's a hierarchy of seniority based on number of terms
served and it matters when considering who's going to assume
leadership or committee roles.

You can organize each house by committee and tie in relationships to
committee staff members. You can construct a network with each
congressman's staff to identify strong connections between
offices. This would help one understand how each office coordinates
with others. And there has to be some kind of differential, where some
offices and faculty members exhibit more influence. Understanding who
has influence, when they have it and why is critical. Perhaps several
senators coordinate to handle specific planks of the party's platform,
so working with their staff might yield more progress to that end.

- working with politicians
  - they all understand the games that are played
  - sometimes things just don't work out the way you want

## Navigating those networks

Understanding how to recognize, navigate, assess and prioritize these
networks, structures and connections enables you to work smarter, get
more done and rise up through the ranks. As someone who's struggled
alot in social situations, it's incredibly frustrating to not
intuitively understand how these things work. If you don't have a
clear understanding of these networks or if you don't have good
information, it's very easy to expend a ton of time/energy in the
wrong place. You're basically spinning your wheels.

That said, it's one thing to notice how these things work and another
to be capable of pulling off a coordinated strategy leveraging players
from your party and reaching across the aisle. You have to be keenly
aware of how other people perceive the system. That includes those in
your party and in opposing parties.

## Anticipating Changes in Needs

This is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal: understanding
how people's needs are going to change from today to tomorrow and from
next year to next decade. This introduces yet another dimension of
complexity to master.

If you know that someone wants something very badly today, but
probably won't want to expend the political capital on it in a month,
then it may or may not be wise to compromise with that person based on
their current needs. Or maybe so. Depends on whether they'd want a
refund, so it depends on how you sell it.

Similarly, if you need something badly today, you might not need it in
a month or a year. Or it might just become less relevant than it seems
today. So bargaining for it might be wise, to ensure that people know
you're working towards their interests. Yet, if you know that the
factors determining that need will change soon, then it could be a
waste of energy pursuing that.

Predicting and understanding is crucial. It means you aren't slogged
down by unnecessary battles and that your effort today is worth at
least as much as it is tomorrow. A corollary to this is that by
introducing issues you can force the opposing party to divide their
energy, or at least draw it towards a more limited range of their
platform ... which can help you predict how they are priortizing their
issues. These techniques really can't be understated.

Everyone wants to look like they're taking part in slaying whatever
dragon is rearing it's head that day. Is it really worth the energy?

## Politicians are Power Brokers

- congressman and faculty operate as power brokers
  - this entails minimizing access to information and power
    - minimizing available surface area for information/power
      increases ability of individual to leverage info/power as an
      asset
      - while simultaneously increasing it's value for other players
      - that is, if one person has lowered barriers to access for
        info/power, then the value for that info/favor is reduced for
        other players
      - so they're breaking the game for others.
        - i hate that it works like this but it does
      - i value transparency, making info freely available and not
        convoluting my own actions to increase the value of some
        info/influence i might be able to offer someone else
      - while improper usage of these tactics can lead one into
        trouble, it's just kinda how it works (i think.....)
  - so there are individual incentives for behavior as a kind of power
    broker, but there are also group incentives at various levels
    - so, in some instances, leveraging an opportunity when it goes
      against party or committee objectives can rub people the wrong
      way, at best
      - at the same time, it's important for people to be able to
        break rank.  if everyone is bound to one rigid platform or
        another, it's too easy to stymie progress.
  - there's a "dark side" to alot of these rules, obviously. i'm not
    really going to detail that aspect of things
    - but usually there is the potential for a politician to tailor
      his message to a specific audience. this is just life, really.
    - but, basically, you gotta watch how you sell what you sell
      because you want the people you compromise with to feel like
      they got what they wanted today, next week and next year.
      - if people are satisfied at first, and later feel shortchanged,
        that will build up.
      - this is especially true when you're trying to establish
        a compromise with "resources" which are hard to pin a dollar
        value to

## Political Resources

- the nature of "resources" in congress
  - these resources are like a kind of currency ...
    - though they are more like commodities in that the value of each
      type can't be equated to others.
      - and two instances of one type will vary wildly in perceived
        value.
      - and an instance of a resource varies in value to each party
        and group that is involved
  - the value is derived from appearances
    - it is not a personal subjective value.  that is, it doesn't
      matter what the thing is worth to you personally.  what matters
      is what it's worth to other people, although this is true for
      most everything.
    - the value of these resources can't really be discretized .. or
      have a numeric, comparable value attached to them.  and they
      shouldn't really.  that's getting uncomfortably close to ethical
      issues.
  - i don't know the specific rules behind ethics for each of these
    resource types or in general. i know that it is very much
    dependent on the manner in which you make an offer
    - or the way you market it to the other party.
    - i do know that anything quid pro quo and especially that which
      is verbally acknowledged as such ...
      - i guess it just doesn't sound great: "i give you X for Y"
      - although it has to work that way sometimes, I'm sure it could
        get you into trouble in some instances or with some resource
        types.
    - honestly, the thought of taking stock of these "resources" as a
      commodity is a bit upsetting to me. but they are tools to push
      for the change you want to see.

  - some resources are fixed in some way.
    - there is only one Speaker of the House and one Minority Whip
      - one Majority/Minority leader
      - there's a fixed number of commitee leadership roles that can
        help you work legislation through
    - there is a limited time each year for the house/senate agenda
      - same applies to committees, which sometimes handle only one
        bill per issue per session.
        - obviously, if it's an important issue or one
        - this is one reason it's been so hard to get marijuana reform
          through the Criminal Justice committees.
          - AFAIK they would take one symbolic action on it per year,
            up until the last decade (maybe a little further)
          - medical was a bit easier, but progress can be stalled
            easily at the committee. this is a mechanism in our
            government that is quite frustrating, but there are
            reasons for enabling that control.

### Bartering for Comprimise

  - bartering for this or anything else requires that you be creative
    & flexible in finding ways to offer value to others
    - rookies on capital hill are going to have to work harder to
      obtain some resources.
  - amendments and bills - these can be used for compromises
  - floor time & agenda
    - unless you have a few years under your belt and have served
      others, then i imagine this would be less available to you than
      to others
      - this increases demand for floor time and agenda influence for
        junior congressmen, meaning they have to barter for it.
  - opportunity & service
    - one can leverage an opportunity or role as part of a compromise
    - or perform some service in aid to a cause, group effort,
      campaign, etc.
      - and leverage the promise of this service
      - or the value of completed service to one's own personal
        reputation
    - and likewise, it's useful to identify/estimate opportunities for
      service to use as leverage ... or as a way to gauge various
      things
  - pr/publicity/press
    - some actions can be undertaken in congress to gain PR points or
      publicity on an issue.
