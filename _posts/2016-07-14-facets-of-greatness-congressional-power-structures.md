All this talk of Trump as an outsider to Washington got me thinking
about what that would be like to be all but green to Washington.

## Washington's Tough for Outsiders

And yes, Trump is an outsider. He's a very successful businessman. The
guy knows how to strategize, leverage his network and orchestrate
people to build success. And there's no doubt he's connected with a
large network of people, but Washington DC has a politically oriented
network. While Trump has strong connections in DC, it's not the same
thing as having worked in DC for decades.

#### &#x2605; How does a candidate best spend his time until the election?

#### &#x2605; How are public appearances prioritized?

#### &#x2605; How do you gear up the infrastructure for an effective campaign?

#### &#x2605; How do you make those decisions to fill cabinet positions? VP?

#### &#x2605; How should you coordinate with campaigns for congress to maximize synergy?

#### &#x2605; How do you design/extend your social network to interface with leadership in Congress?

#### &#x2605; How do you interface with the opposition in Congress and elsewhere?

#### &#x2605; What would you do to set the tone when you set foot in office and why?

#### &#x2605; How do you prioritize your agenda early on?

#### &#x2605; What should be done to prepare?

These are all challenging questions, but especially so when you need
to make new connections. However, a tabula rasa isn't so bad. You get
a fresh start, if you play your cards right.

## Integrating with the Washington Machine

Political outsiders would likely face some difficulty integrating with
existing power structures in DC. Some heavily invested businesspeople
might run into conflicts of interest. They know that. You don't just
wing it in Washington.

#### Anticipate How Appearances will be Contorted

However, politics is about appearances. You'll find situations twisted
against you, just because it seems believable. It's not a good idea to
do something just because you can. Hopefully people are reasonable
about this, but it gets dirty quick. If he wins, Trump needs to assert
leadership early because of the political climate. If it were me, I'd
be looking for people to use as examples to assert leadership so other
people get the picture. I'd make it known that I want examples. And
people are going to want to test out those waters. Go ahead.

#### Minimize Surface Area for Attack

To minimize surface area for people to attack, some divestment would
be worthwhile because if you no longer have your assets & investments,
then you can't be said to be influenced by them. At least it's not so
easy. And by the way, I'm sure Trump has considered this stuff.

#### Restructure or Divest

As for your portfolio, you could restructure the assets & investments
or divest some of them entirely. If you divest and transfer ownership,
you get the liquidity and you don't have to be concerned with upkeep.

#### You Don't Have Time for That Side-Gig

General rule: politicians don't mix well with active business
ventures, which also means that you are better off to forego
opportunities while in politics. If you're a career politician, more
valuable to forego large investments. It might be easier to cash in
your chips.

You really can't be expected to run a business while obligated to the
duties of federal office. It'd be difficult to say the least. If
divestment and restructuring don't work, then your best bet is to find
someone you trust manage these investments for you. This could be
risky, but that can be minimized through strategery and trust.

An edge case, as an example of risk: if that person puts you in the
position where you can't be seen having profited by visibly correcting
this person's mistakes. they could make a series of subtly bad
management decisions, which you wouldn't have had time to see, giving
them some advantage. They could mismanage, dropping the stock price
temporarily, allowing them to attempt to skim ownership of the
company, in an opportunistic manner. Anyone who would mismanage for an
advantage? *Send 'em to the moon.*

In fact, that's a great test case to determine if you can trust
someone, period. Find a way to put the cheese right in front of
them. See what they do. You have to be able to *know* you can trust
someone or *know* that you've got the chips stacked so you're not
depending on trust to mitigate risk.

If you haven't figured this out, I'm a very, very paranoid
person. *Contents fragile once damaged.*

This is an oddly specific scenario and not likely, but I can imagine
that there would be other scenarios, difficult to foresee until you
get bit once or twice. More to the point, any problems that arise
would distract from your duties as a politician. But, if you have
significant assets, then you probably already have people you trust
who help you run the show.

#### Investing in Specific Industries Invites Problems

As much as people like to accuse politicians of scheming to get rich,
career politicians will stay away from large investments, especially
conflicts of interest. It opens you up for attacks. Investments in
some industries are riskier than others, like those which allocate
extensive resources towards lobbying.

#### Line Up Your Incentives

It really depends on the industry in which you are invested and the
role you play in the business. If you have significant assets in some
industries, this could be an advantage if you find the incentives that
motivate your actions line up with the people you support. This is a
challenge if you're heavily invested in some faceless megacorp. That's
just not relatable.

However, if you are heavily invested in real estate and especially
commercial real estate, you'll find that your incentives line up with
much of your support. While Trump has a much, much larger asset
portfolio than the average joe, he has a lot of support from the
middle class and small business owners. These people care about the
value of real estate just as much as Trump.

#### Cooperative Game Theory

> **Line up your incentives *AND WIN EVERY TIME!*:** form groups and
> coalitions with people who share your incentives. You need to
> understand how to identify what drives the behavior of people and
> groups. Find people who share your motivations and goals. Or find a
> way to adapt your incentives and goals to better match that of other
> groups. *You will win every time!*


## Congressional Networks

Between the House and the Senate, there are 435 Representatives and
100 Senators, but this isn't the only way to group these people.  As I
tend to do, I found a mathematic analogy. Higher level math is useful
because it has so many parallels with real life. In fact, to master
real life, you have to learn these tools, whether you realize it or
not. And this is a great example of learning to view your personal
networks from several perspectives.

Members of congressmen and faculty on Capitol Hill can be recomposed
into various views, including by officially defined groups like
committees and less explicit affiliations. The house and senate can be
divided into leadership, administrators and general congressmen. You
can further organize this view via seniority, political influence or
on some other dimension. These groups can be reorganized into groups
that satisfy some functional objective. E.G. all senators who have
served 12+ years or all representatives who've served 6+
years. There's a hierarchy of seniority based on number of terms
served and it matters when considering who's going to assume
leadership or committee roles.

You can organize each house by committee and tie in relationships to
committee staff members. You can construct a network with each
congressman's staff to identify strong connections between
offices. This would help one understand how each office coordinates
with others. And there has to be some kind of differential, where some
offices and faculty members exhibit more influence. Understanding who
has influence, when they have it and why is critical. Perhaps several
senators coordinate to handle specific planks of the party's platform,
so working with their staff might yield more progress to that end.

- working with politicians
  - they all understand the games that are played
  - sometimes things just don't work out the way you want

## Navigating those networks

Understanding how to recognize, navigate, assess and prioritize these
networks, structures and connections enables you to work smarter, get
more done and rise up through the ranks. As someone who's struggled
alot in social situations, it's incredibly frustrating to not
intuitively understand how these things work. If you don't have a
clear understanding of these networks or if you don't have good
information, it's very easy to expend a ton of time/energy in the
wrong place. You're basically spinning your wheels.

That said, it's one thing to notice how these things work and another
to be capable of pulling off a coordinated strategy leveraging players
from your party and reaching across the aisle. You have to be keenly
aware of how other people perceive the system. That includes those in
your party and in opposing parties.

## Anticipating Changes in Needs

This is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal: understanding
how people's needs are going to change from today to tomorrow and from
next year to next decade. This introduces yet another dimension of
complexity to master.

If you know that someone wants something very badly today, but
probably won't want to expend the political capital on it in a month,
then it may or may not be wise to compromise with that person based on
their current needs. Or maybe so. Depends on whether they'd want a
refund, so it depends on how you sell it.

Similarly, if you need something badly today, you might not need it in
a month or a year. Or it might just become less relevant than it seems
today. So bargaining for it might be wise, to ensure that people know
you're working towards their interests. Yet, if you know that the
factors determining that need will change soon, then it could be a
waste of energy pursuing that.

Predicting and understanding is crucial. It means you aren't slogged
down by unnecessary battles and that your effort today is worth at
least as much as it is tomorrow. A corollary to this is that by
introducing issues you can force the opposing party to divide their
energy, or at least draw it towards a more limited range of their
platform ... which can help you predict how they are priortizing their
issues. These techniques really can't be understated.

Everyone wants to look like they're taking part in slaying whatever
dragon is rearing it's head that day. Is it really worth the energy?

## Politicians are Power Brokers

Congressmen and faculty are power brokers. So are bureaucrats. And
when it comes down to it, we are all politicians on one level or
another. This pops up all the time in the business world and whenever
there's competition. A politician is someone who knows what they want
and needs to find a way to get there. So they have to abstract their
needs from their presentation of needs. In turn, there are people you
have to work with with a similar disposition: they have goals and
there's an abstraction between their actions and how they present
their actions. That's what politics is about. Politics begins to take
on interesting group dynamics as you add groups, rules and change.

It can be frustrating. I've learned a lot of hard lessons about
politics over the years in unusual places.

If politicians are power brokers, what does this imply? What is a good
politician? A proficient politician aquires and leverages advantage.
There are different ways to do this. Some are great; some are good;
some are bad. You can't forget that you're dealing with people and in
Washington, you're dealing with good people. Yes, even the politicians
on the news for being in trouble are typically good people. They
invested their lives in this. They have families. And they are
typically upstanding citizens. Everyone makes a few mistakes, even
though there really are a few bad apples out there.

But, to optimize one's own advantage within an explicitly political
system like Congress, this entails minimizing access to information
and power. You're trying to minimize available surface area for
information and power, which increases your opportunity to leverage
that information as an asset. While restricting availability of
information, you simultaneously increase its value for other players.

This is a lesson I learned from bboys. Yes, breakdancers. I used to
show off all the time. I wasn't really showing off. I was having fun
or practicing. However, in various situations, this can dilute the
entertainment value of bboying. It used to be pretty rare to see. If
it's completely common and for no reason, then it begins to lose it's
excitement and novelty. Also, it attracts attention. The people who
have experienced a lot of success in the entertainment industry don't
like that attention. Getting attention kinda what they do for work and
it can feel like work.

The point is, if you're diluting the value for yourself, that's your
own problem. If you're diluting the value a group of people, that's
another. The group dynamic takes over. If one person has lowered
barriers to access for information or power, then the value for that
resource is reduced for other players. Someone's breaking the game. I
can't stand that it works like this, but sometimes it does.

I value transparency and making knowledge freely available. I'd rather
not convolute my own actions to fit appearances and it's frustrating
to be jerked around by other players in a situation like that. They
obfuscate a simple situation by wrapping it in another game and
completely circumvent the apparent realities of the more simple
situation.

#### Individual and Group Dynamics

There are individual incentives for behavior as a kind of power
broker, but there are also group incentives at various levels So, in
some instances, leveraging an opportunity when it goes against party,
committee or group objectives can rub people the wrong way, at best.
At the same time, it's important for people to be able to break rank.
If everyone is bound to one rigid platform or another, it's to easy to
stymie progress. The point to adhering to group dynamics is to
accomplish shared goals through compromise.

#### A "Dark Side"

There's a "dark side" that can emerge from these rules, obviously. I'm
not going to delve too far into those aspects. There's the potential
for a politician to tailor his message to a specific audience, where
they speak out of both sides of their mouth, so to speak. Or they can
convince or restrain you from communicating with other people.

#### Watch how you sell what you sell

However, you have to watch how you sell what you sell. You want the
people you compromise with to feel like what they wanted today, next
week and next year. If people are satisfied at first and later feel
shortchanged, that will build up. This is especially true with
politics when you're trying to establish a compromise with resources
which are hard to pin a dollar amount to. Actually, you can't pin a
dollar amount to most of these: it's unethical. And so there's no
medium of exchange. Misunderstandings like these are eased and
ameliorated with communication and empathy.

## Political Resources

In Congress, there are resouces like

- the nature of "resources" in congress
  - these resources are like a kind of currency ...
    - though they are more like commodities in that the value of each
      type can't be equated to others.
      - and two instances of one type will vary wildly in perceived
        value.
      - and an instance of a resource varies in value to each party
        and group that is involved


#### Value Derives from Appearances

- the value is derived from appearances
  - it is not a personal subjective value.  that is, it doesn't
    matter what the thing is worth to you personally.  what matters
    is what it's worth to other people, although this is true for
    most everything.
  - the value of these resources can't really be discretized .. or
    have a numeric & comparable value attached to them. and they
    shouldn't really. that's getting uncomfortably close to ethical
    issues.

#### Ethics

- i don't know the specific rules behind ethics for each of these
    resource types or in general. i know that it is very much
    dependent on the manner in which you make an offer
    - or the way you market it to the other party.
    - i do know that anything quid pro quo and especially that which
      is verbally acknowledged as such ...
      - i guess it just doesn't sound great: "i give you X for Y"
      - although it has to work that way sometimes, I'm sure it could
        get you into trouble in some instances or with some resource
        types.
    - honestly, the thought of taking stock of these "resources" as a
      commodity is a bit upsetting to me. but they are tools to push
      for the change you want to see.

#### Limited Resources

  - some resources are fixed in some way.
    - there is only one Speaker of the House and one Minority Whip
      - one Majority/Minority leader
      - there's a fixed number of commitee leadership roles that can
        help you work legislation through
    - there is a limited time each year for the house/senate agenda
      - same applies to committees, which sometimes handle only one
        bill per issue per session.
        - obviously, if it's an important issue or one
        - this is one reason it's been so hard to get marijuana reform
          through the Criminal Justice committees.
          - AFAIK they would take one symbolic action on it per year,
            up until the last decade (maybe a little further)
          - medical was a bit easier, but progress can be stalled
            easily at the commi this is a mechanism in our
            government that is quite frustrating, but there are
            reasons for enabling that control.

#### Bartering with Political Resources

  - bartering for this or anything else requires that you be creative
    & flexible in finding ways to offer value to others
    - rookies on capital hill are going to have to work harder to
      obtain some resources.
  - amendments and bills - these can be used for compromises

## Political Resource Types

#### Floor Time and Agenda

- floor time & agenda
    - unless you have a few years under your belt and have served
      others, then i imagine this would be less available to you than
      to others
      - this increases demand for floor time and agenda influence for
        junior congressmen, meaning they have to barter for it.
  - specific times of the day/season are more valuable

#### Opportunity and Service

- opportunity & service
    - one can leverage an opportunity or role as part of a compromise
    - or perform some service in aid to a cause, group effort,
      campaign, etc.
      - and leverage the promise of this service
      - or the value of completed service to one's own personal
        reputation
    - and likewise, it's useful to identify/estimate opportunities for
      service to use as leverage ... or as a way to gauge various
      things

#### Staff and Human Resources

- staff members (useful especially for rookie congressmen)

#### PR, Publicity & Press

- pr/publicity/press
    - some actions can be undertaken in congress to gain PR points or
      publicity on an issue.
      - I doubt this is the primary motivating factor in deciding
        whether or not to take an action, but you have to understand
        how your actions will affect your relationships with people
        around you.
        - crucial for maintaining relationships with funding sources
          and lobbyists
      - in fact, visible action is so crucial that one should review
        the nature of promises both public and private made to
        supporters, at least once every quarter or so
        - enumerating your supporters, their needs and their
          expectations helps you ensure that your giving back to those
          who are pushing you forward

#### Budget Items

- budgets (office/staff for congressman, etc. and committee staff)
    - if you hold an office, legislative, executive, judicial,
      administrative, or otherwise, then I'd imagine you'd have some
      kind of budget.
      - in many cases, it's probably not managed personally, but you
        have influence over it.
        - money <=> power

#### Personal Time

- personal time
  - one has to leverage their time efficiently, while remaining
    flexible, which becomes incredibly difficult as you gain
    influence

#### Knowledge of the System

- your understanding of the system
  - how you model the system and perceive the relationships between
    people is incredibly valuable
    - in fact, this might be one of your greatest sources of value

#### Commitee Time & Agenda

- committee agenda & time

## Prioritizing Resources

- understanding how to estimate, prioritize and schedule your
  available resources
  - need to be able to take stock of the tools available to you and
    how each kind differs by nature.
    - some resources are more appropriate
    - some resources are more scarce
    - a resource's value differs from you to them
      - identify this and utilize it
  - seeking mutual benefit is best.  it's win, win, win
    - you win bc you get what you want.
    - they win because they get what they want
    - and you win again because you profited in some other way in
      giving them what they wanted ... this could be shady though
  - seeking long-term mutual benefit is even better
  - remember that some relationships are meant to grow and others are
    not. help those who need it, but don't forget to help yourself

### misc

- yearly cycle of events (executive branch)
  - white house press conference
  - NATO conference
  - etc
- there's a kind of yearly rhythm to lots of these events
  - events could be slightly out of order or missing, etc
  - but there might be some more predictable effects preceding or
    following specific events
    - e.g. slightly higher approval ratings after the standup at the
      white house press conference


### Identifying a Vice President

The executive branch needs to be able to set the tone for legislative
sessions. The Vice President presides over the Senate. Past VP's have
varied with regard to how much influence they exert on the Senate's
agenda and operations. Since that person is involved with the
legislature, it would be beneficial to choose someone who has
preexisting connections with congressmen and their staffmembers.

That's not a determining factor for such a decision and would be
easily be outweighed. It should be easy to identify someone in your
staff who has many of the same connections. When you're making a
decision like that, you want to play to the party. It's an early
opportunity to work work with the rest of the party to find someone
they feel is deserving and is the right person in that regard.
Chemistry is also important. Finding the right VP would be a bit
tougher for a VP.
