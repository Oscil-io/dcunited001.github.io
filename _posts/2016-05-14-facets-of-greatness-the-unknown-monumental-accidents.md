No one does anything truly great by accident ... well, almost no
one. But there are a fortunate few, whereby serendipity of fate or
accidental life circumstance, who life equips with not only the
insight required to understand the importance of these **facets of
greatness**, but also the mind and behaviors to clear a path. And the
spirit to conquer these challenges.

Speaking of clearing a path, I blogged about some
[crazy dreams](/posts/2016-05-14-oneironautics-questing-for-lucidity.html)
where my mind needed me to do just that.

### Guard Your Will to Fight

This is why you must guard your will to fight.  No matter how capable
your mind and body are, if your spirit is broken, you will give up.
Your most dangerous enemies will go for that first.  The kinds of
people you need to look out for won't directly attack you.  People
like that are easy to deal with.  They practically take care of
themselves! If you look like an asshole or overtly coerce someone
emotionally, people aren't going to want to deal with you.

Your more capable and dangerous opponents will not be overt.  They
will seek to control the audience and abuse channels of communication.
They will do so subtly, before you know what hit you.  I wrote 20,000
words about workplace bullying.  While I pulled the content, I've been
thinking about reposting it.  I'm tired of dealing with people and
tactics like this.  As many campaigns as there are about bullying,
these tactics only seem to be more accepted as time goes on and their
practitioners further entrenched.

Anyways, these people will drain your spirit, and limit your
influence.  They will identify your stongest social connections in
some environment and try to sever them, exhaust them or turn them
against you.  They'll redirect your energy or place themselves between
you and your manager, remapping correspondence and distort your
relationship by contorting your actions or abusing the game of
telephone.

- this is why you must guard your will to fight
    - your [most dangerous] enemies will go for that first
    - the kinds of people you need to look out for won't directly attack you
      - people like that are easy to deal with.  practically take care of themselves.
    - but they'll drain your spirit, redirect your energy and leave you exhausted.

### ???

the unknown facet (rewrite summary!)
- describe it as the things we don't know or can't know
  - we should become comfortable with what we can't do yet or with
    what we haven't learned
  - by challenging ourselves to experience what is uncomfortable(?) or
    difficult, we expand our ability to deal with those situations the
    next time
    - because our mind is the product of ideas and processes that it
      can combinate, then by developing skills which are challenging
      and difficult for most, our mind will become more capable than
      others.
    - some of us have unique challenges that prevent us from
      experiencing some things and this means that there are some
      ideas or extensions of those ideas which aren't available to
      everyone.  or rather, those ideas are only available
      vicariously.
      - but we should embrace those people who can expand our minds by
        sharing experiences that we can't have or truly can't know

far too many people associate being different with weakness
- they seek to identify what makes others different and they point it
  out.  they question it.  they criticize it.  sometimes they accept
  it, but usually people will try to use it in some way.  (examples?)

and, with respect to themselves ... instead of embracing their
uniqueness, they lie to themselves by distorting their true self to
seek conformity.
- they assume that whatever it is that makes them different makes them
  weak and so they seek
  - they see whatever part of them that doesn't conform as being an
    unnecessary appendage that should be amputated and cauterized
    before it threatens their conformity.
  - and by accepting this, they delude themselves into destroying
    their strengths.
  - example: blind & deaf people have minds that are fundamentally
    different than those of "normal people".  What is usually
    considered a weakness can actually be a strength, though dealing
    with something like blindness presents many challenges.
    - however, if we consider humanity to be the product of all the
      ideas available to our collective minds, shouldn't we embrace
      diversity of thought as a strength? these people who have
      endured challenge after challenge in their lives and whose minds
      will no doubt contain a wholly different range of memories and
      ideas, we should see them as luminaries who can see things we
      could never imagine.
  - example: for america, it's actually our diversity that is our
    greatest strength. we are a patchwork of various cultures, all
    assimilated to some varying degree.  by assuming that we should
    all melt into a single culture, we will actually lose our greatest
    strength.  our cultural diversity is one thing that america has
    that no other culture on earth can match.
    - cultural homogeny means that one group of people can more simply
      and more easily motivate others towards action.  however, at the
      same time, homogeny leads to weakness.
    - homogeny reduces our ability to provide robust cultural
      defenses.
    - it limits the scope of ideas that we can combinate in order to
      discover new ones.
    - it makes us more vulnerable since we are restricted to that set
      of ideas.
    - [include section from my draft on fighting kony]
  - it's actually been shown that cultural dissonance drives
    intelligence because the struggle to understand and interoperate
    with a foreign culture eventually empowers the mind (recent
    studies on this)
- at the same time, diversity presents challenges. multiculturalism
  isn't easy and all too often the interests of one culture dominate
  that of others.
  - it can be more difficult to unify people to fight or the convey
    the urgency of uniting towards a higher purpose.
    - it's incredibly important for our world to retain this ability
      to protect ourselves from the chaos resulting from strained
      relationships or turbulent economics or some catastrophe.

wisdom as knowing what to do when you do not know (rewrite)
- having the patience and intuition for times when it seems that you
  have a set course of action or viable options

knowing when to make a stand and when to hold your cards (partial rewrite)
- knowing how to recognize a situation where doing nothing is the only
  wrong thing to do
  - while respecting the beauty of things as inherantly perfect as
    they are, where any form of intervention would only destroy that
    thing or mar it's beauty.

- knowing how important diversity is to personal growth, it's also
  important to recognize that a wide range of experiences and a
  self-directed life is crucial for ourselves and our children.
  people need to be able to think for themselves and make their own
  mistakes ... most of the time.
  - sometimes it's crucial to intervene, but too often, and you'll
    stagnate or interfere with or completely redirect that person's
    development. maybe that's for the best, but who can be the judge?
  - analogy to bonsai trees: environment, nutrition, trimming, etc.
    - interference results in redirection of the tree's energy
    - but you can never actually control how the tree uses it's life
      force.
    - and many such interventions end up reducing that tree's ability
      to grow.
  - analogy to a ship in a bottle?
  - the importance of someone's idea of independence to their
    development.  by intervening in a very opaque way that is obvious
    to that person, you have now altered their course.
    - it can be very difficult to intervene in such a way that is
      transparent and effective (again, who should be the judge of
      what is effective for someone's life and goals?)
    - but is worth the effort, for that person can retain their sense
      of independence.  just as their successes will belong to them,
      so will their setbacks and struggles.
    - this is why, even though it'd be great to receive credit for
      various things, it's impossible to prove who set what in motion.
      - honestly, in my case, there are so many other people who are
        more capable of taking on some lofty pipe dream.  who knows
        whether it would work out.
      - a corollary of this is that if you are hard at work on some
        project, you also need to be aware of how your efforts are
        perceived, if you care about getting credit or being
        recognized.
