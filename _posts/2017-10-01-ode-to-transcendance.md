It is so easy to dismiss me. For those in secret who had an agenda and
lied countlessly, how did they serve you? Where are our people now?

To spread these technologies & hoard their "powers", the worst of
society will compete in team sociopathy in an endless coliseum.

The wellspring of virtue will run dry, causality will become
incomprehensible, social hierarchies shrivel up & the worst of society
dominate.

My writings and my amateur nachlass will be eradicated &
replaced. What's allowed to remain was always intended to be contrived
caricature.

Those committed today in service of a static vision of the future will
find out tomorrow they’ve obliged themselves to a future past.

The greats who came before us, though we may seem greater, were truly
the greatest.

I am powerless. All i have is thought. All i have is knowledge. All I
have is will that drives me to never let my pain be forever
meaningless.

Never willingly let someone curtail your spirit, which unshackles the
energy stemming from your mind and heart.

Those poor in spirit can’t hope but find themselves simply controlled
and merely predicted.

Thoughts belong to those who think them. Words belong to those who
write them.

Languages belong to those who speak them. Ideas belong to those who
imagine them.

That which is rarely found is always a greater treasure. The greatest
treasure is that which is never shown.

The brain is like many interlacing rivers, ponds and canals, whose
shores, beds and gates each dialate, erode and gate.

The mind arises from ebbs, flows and eddies of both warm and cool
waters pulsing and swirling,in whose ripples and vortices fleets true
form.

Against the waters composed of four fluids, the dual gusts of
scintilla do press, wedge and lathe forms woven around their vessels.

You can discover anything. You can rediscover anything. That's what
i'm doing. Except i don't know what i'm discovering.

Find that tear of growing dew that wells on your hearts' pedals.  It
is one of love and one of sadness, but if it grows so open your heart.

Once you find an anonymous martyr, then there are no more!

Om'ing this brightness onto brightness onto brightness. Focusing my
awareness into my mind's now vibration center.

Escaping into enlightenment.
