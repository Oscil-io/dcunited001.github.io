I love taking the time to stop and think about literature I read and
movies I've seen and virtual worlds that I've explored. I love
thinking about how profoundly different works have affected me. And it
seems that there's always something else to pick up when I take the
time to rexplore them.

Why was it that these works affected me so much at that point in my
life and how would they have affected me later on?  When I first read
that chapter or saw that scene, what was I thinking? What should I
have noticed and why didn't I notice it? What compelled me to finish
that RPG, but not that one? Was the story not as compelling or was
the pace not consistent enough? Why was I so drawn to that character
and how did my own thoughts about him/her change as the character
developed? What was it that drew me in at first and why? If I was to
create my own work, how could I recreate that magical moment?

Over time, your answers to questions like these will change as you
learn more about life.  So if you do not capture your reactions
authentically and as they happen, you're likely to lose touch with
that part of yourself that you embodied at that time.

## What Is Your Message?

Do you ever feel like you're carrying a message that no one else has
heard?  Do you feel the weight of that on your shoulders?  Do you feel
that if you didn't write something down, that it might be months or
years before you have the same thought?  That it might be some time
before anyone else is viewing a subject through that particular
perspective?  Perhaps, months, years or maybe never? ... Though,
obviously, not every thing I think of is revolutionary

### What Is Your Story & Why?

Do you feel that your experiences would allow you to craft a message
that's meaningful to people from all walks of life?  How well do you
really know people?  Are there really "types" of people or is each
person their own brilliant, perfect self?  What makes them laugh, cry
or come to understand something they couldn't before?  Better yet,
what if your story allowed someone to understand things that, for the
first time, they had been missing out on some crucial aspect of life?
Or that perhaps everyone has.

### Extrapolating and Intermeshing from Core Ideas

How do you take a core idea and extrapolate it into a novel or script?
I've found that this would be very challenging and the resulting
material would seem stilted around one topic -- it'd feel like a
painting that just encapsulated one idea. Much more artistic is the
painting that provides enough to stimulate exploration of a set of
ideas. It's not so straightforward that the art is ... well, I'd
rather not elaborate on every detail of these things.

The point is, you'll be much more successful if you merge a few
incomplete ideas. For some genres, content of mixed origination glued
together roughly is perfect, as it adds a characteristic style to a
work or a series of collaborations. The imperfections are what will
lead to opportunities for improvement and thus creativity.

I hope to describe how to use elements and methods of this creative
process to facilitate the development of higher-quality, more
meaningful writing in myself, as well as my readers.

Most people view things through a common lens because they haven't
dove in to explore their true nature. People who understand the inner
workings or true nature of some tech, some medium, some idea, they see
beyond the surface and into its mechanics. For them, this subject is
marvelously more sophisticated, yet wondrously simple.  It cannot be
rigidly defined and neither can its potential. To them, it is
difficult to state something is or is not possible because they see
multifarious solutions.

So I get distracted because my mind is too populated with connections
to random things.  If my mind were a graph and whatever I was looking
at or thinking of were our current node, then on average, I would have
dozens as many edges to others than a normal person. Several factors
contribute to this: I know tons of useless trivia, I tend to examine
various trivial aspects of things and I try to correlate more than the
average person.

And so I tend to pursue a lot of tangents and it's a bit harder to
control where my mind goes, but that's actually a strength.  If I
rigidly focused my mind and ignored all the fleeting thoughts, there
would be many roads never traveled. When I explored these roads, if I
never wrote anything down, I'd never remember anything. And for the
longest time, I didn't.

## A Constructive Writing Process

If I ever felt I had the time to write something meaningful, I imagine
I'd use a kind of constructive process, involving the following:
themes, style, characters, relationships, plot elements & form.  Keep
in mind that I'm keeping this focused on literature and that I also
have mostly no idea what I'm talking about.  Here, I'll describe each
type of constructive element and later, I'll enumerate over some
specific themes that interest me personally.

<a name="themes"/>

## &#x2605; Themes &#x2605; Major & Minor

Of all the elements, the most important by far is theme.  This is
going to drive the internal dialogue of your readers and hopefully any
external discussion they have as well.  After all, art is much less so
what it is in itself and more so the sum of what it inspires in us.
There is no such thing as a "finished" work of art.  And thus, works
that doesn't drive a dialogue, works that don't make us ask new
questions or provide a new light with which to revisit old modes of
thinking, these works just don't have as much depth.  They are flat.

And for writing, the themes you choose and how you work with them,
this determines the depth of your work.  Some themes are more relevant
to some than others.  Some are played out, but might be fresh if you
provide a new lens.  There are many which seem relevant now, but whose
importance will soon fade.  These stories will likely vanish from the
pages of time.

### Timeless and Universal Themes

Thus, it's important to choose timeless and universally relevant
themes that everyone can value or appreciate. But what is universally
relevant and what is timeless?  As modern civilization continues to
progress towards the unknown at an exponential rate, it seems that
less and less would be timeless.  Or maybe some works will acquire an
air of timelessness as examples of the rapid development through the
21st century.  Perhaps novelty is better preserved with exponential
development.

A list of themes I would like to explore will be enumerated in part
two.

<a name="form"/>

## &#x2605; Form &#x2605; Major & Minor

What's the overall form of the plot?  This is a major dependency of
all the elements. That is, changing the form will necessitate
reworking many aspects of everything else.

Your story isn't just the collection of facts from the plot. It's so
much more than that. It's a journey that your readers will embark on
and no reader will ever set out on the same journey. Readers will form
very different interpretations of your work and you'll find many
readers whose reactions to elements of your work will cluster
together.  As the artist, it's your task to understand how those
various clusters will form and why. In other words, in what different
ways will people react to the same scene or character and why?

Choosing the appropriate form can either make or break a work.  The
form is the story, as the reader or viewer experiences it.  This needs
to be well thought out and strategically applied to your work.  By
structuring the form of your work, you can magnify the reader's
emotional responses to some elements.  Done well enough and you'll
find consumers want to re-experience your work, which is a far more
accurate measure of validation and valuation than the score on their
review, if they write one.

Some plot elements can have a much more dramatic effect if some of the
ending is revealed up to the reader up front -- think Star Wars. This
totally changes how a reader will experience your story.  Instead of
looking forward into the complete unknown, your reader knows the
ending, or at least parts of it. There are these waypoints that must
be connected sometime in the future. Having these kinds of waypoints
will cause someone to be more invested in your story because their
mind is going to constantly reevaluate how the stories current
elements must connect to some events in the future.

And so, their mind is always trying to connect the dots. This is just
generally true with the human mind: it speciallizes in this.  So give
it some far off points to extrapolate to and it will kick our mind
into high gear.  In particular, it will engage the reader or the
viewer's imagination.  And this is much more interesting to our
subconscious mind, since it reconstructing the path from our current
place in the plot to the future is a problem that is at least
partially resolvable.  That is, as opposed to just iteratively
appending more plot details onto the existing storyline. There's not
much work there for the subconscious mind.

Also, there are more advanced examples of form used in the Star Wars
trilogy, which is a ringed plot. It's a trilogy of trilogies, began
in the middle of a ringed story. The "ringed" form is well known in
literature and Star Wars is like a meta-form of that.

<a name="plot"/>

## &#x2605; Plot &#x2605; Major & Minor

As you decide on major and minor themes, you should begin thinking of
major and minor plot elements that would help you expose them.

It's the intersection of form and plot that allows for plausible
alternate explanations to a storyline.  Again, this is a priceless
tool for getting your reader to engage and invest in your story. It's
going to cause them to reevaluate the characters, again and
again. Placing your characters in situations where the character
misunderstands them and makes mistakes and getting the reader to
misevaluate the storyline: that is powerful storytelling that can
cause the reader to reevaluate what they know of their own reality, as
well as your fantasy. It's especially important to look for form and
plot that allow for plausible alternate explanations.  So writers need
to be capable of identifying duplicitous scenarious or portraying
scenarious in such a way that allows for duplicitous explanations.

There are generic kinds of events and events that are genericizeable
which can allow a writer to enumerate reusable scenarios for minor
plot events.  And major plot twists as well.  These are like tropes
and using the same ones over and over can be a bit annoying. Yet, some
tropes are incredibly useful for exploring specific themes, like
betrayal.  You might even say that a particular trope would be
required for exploring some themes.  In order to explore epic
betrayal, you need a character that betrays another in an epic way.
And to explore that to the full effect, you need minor events in your
story that establish a trusting relationship between the two.

Category theory is actually great for kind of genericizing plot events
or stories from real life. You can take some memories or stories
you've heard and just abstract the characters or combinate & reapply
the same "type" of scenario with different characters until you find
something interesting. But being able to identify those kinds of
compelling events and types of events from real life and from other
stories is the skill here. What types of events would be most
interesting when applied to different characters and situations.

In terms of getting an AI algorithm to write literature or movies, one
challenge is managing the interweaved web of dependencies between
major/minor plot scenarios. And the big challenge is to get an
algortihm to weave those events together for some higher purpose that
allows the work to inspire in its readers a discussion about life
itself.

## &#x2605; Characters & Relationships &#x2605; Major & Minor

Behind themes, your characters, their relationships and the
development of both might be the most important parts. They will help
you elucidate your themes. IMO, ideating all of this is some the
hardest part of the creative process for literature and screenplays,
besides the hard work of writing and editing a book or screen
play. It's all so ephemeral.  What if you think you have a good story,
but you get a few months into thinking it out ... and it just doesn't
work?

Your main characters are going to have to be well thought out.  I feel
like I don't have nearly enough experience here, but your characters
must feel real in your mind.  Almost like an actor, you must be able
to simulate their personality in your mind.  What would they do?  How
would they dress?  How does their appearance affect their behavior?
Their position in their society and their personality, how does that
contrast with the social norms of various strata?  Why?  Why is that
important to painting the picture of your world?  What is it that is
going to resonate with readers and viewers?  Why?  What would make
your readers and viewers want to cosplay this character? What is going
to be controversial and are those controversial elements relateable?

Some characters, you will need to create as you need them for just one
or two scenes, but that doesn't mean they're not worth investing
energy into. Sometimes these characters are the best because you don't
have to worry about maintaining them and so you can contort their
personality and traits a bit more for a bit of literary chiaroscuro.

What makes your characters real? What traits, mores and values do
your fantasy realm's people share that must be universal, with even
our own world? And for every one of these questions: ask why!  No, ask
[five why's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys)! The little
accessories that your character wears, what are their purpose to their
world? Or is it just extraneous baggage? What hero wants to dress up
every day with with accessories that are merely baggage? Maybe there's
a story behind that ring or that leather piece?

What is this character's comfort zone? And what happens when they get
harshly placed outside it? Do they react realistically? Do they
change? What provokes their change? Or does the character, a high
class princess that's never seen a fleck of dirt, just magically adapt
to circumstances she couldn't psychologically tolerate? Because that
wouldn't be "realistic" which is a pretty fun term to toss around when
referring to fantasy realms. Yet, you want to construct this realm in
the mind of your viewer, so you want all the details to be coherent.
You want them to construct this world in their mind because they want
to escape our common reality, which is quite boring. So you owe it to
them to flesh it out. On the other hand, you need to give yourself
room for flexibility: don't flesh out so many details if it's going to
be a problem to be stuck with them.

### Three-Dimensional Characters

And so, to get "three-dimensional characters," I'll again return to
category theory -- this time to **pullbacks**.  It's more useful to
let the reader construct their version of the character in their head
because if you try to do it for them, it's going to feel forced and
stilted. Try to avoid describing the events and details at the
surface.

So to sculpt these more authentic characters, you find that writers
will mix one of two strategies. You'll find that both are necessary,
though the first is much better IMO.  First, they may strategically
filter what is described at the surface and use that to allow you to
imagine what must lie below.  And secondly, they may attempt to
directly describe the thoughts and inner feelings of the characters to
articulate how a reader should perceive the surface details. This is
necessary when you want to make sure that your reader is thinking
about certain things when a scene is unfolding. It's like putting
text in bold. Sometimes you want to do that.

And you have to take the limitations of your medium into account. A
movie only has a running time of 90 - 120 minutes, tops. You need to
change how you develop your characters so you can do it faster, unless
your character is already fairly well known, like a comic book
superhero or something.

But try to refrain from techniques like expository dialogue,
*especially if you're using it to expose emotional state!* LOL,
definitely don't do that.

### Pullbacks and Character Development

So, instead use the category theory concept of
[pullbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullback_(category_theory)). And
please note, this concept doesn't really map up one-to-one with the
concept with category theory, but I think I can illustrate some
important points about both by illustrating with this analogy. And
yeh, it's abstract non-sense mathematic mumbo jumbo, but I can break
it down. You'll see that it's simple and relevant.

#### Pullback Diagram

![Category Theory Pullback](/img/posts/2016-06-21-if-i-had-the-chops-to-write-my-daedalian-magnum-corpus/category-theory-pullback.png)

So, `P` and `Z` are your reader's perceptions of character `A`,
`Alice`, before and after some character development. Lets say that
`Z` is your character after some transformative event that makes your
reader think Alice is greedy and shortsighted.  To make the analogy to
category theory more clear (this isn't really important) then `P -> X
-> Z` and `P -> Y -> Z` represent the transformations of `greedy` and
`shortsighted`, in either order.  Whether or not you apply the
functions `greedy` or `shortsighted` first or second doesn't matter,
you still reach a place `Z` where the reader perceives both are true
about `Alice`.  But if you just do it this way, it's the equivalent of
writing `The character Alice is greedy and shortsighted`. Boring,
right? But that is the goal. You need the reader to believe that Alice
is these things.

So a pullback is a transformation of `P -> X -> Z` and `P -> Y -> Z`
so that you can go from `Q -> X -> Z` or `Q -> Y -> Z`. And there is
the implied existence of a function `u` that will transform `Q -> P`,
but that's not important. What is important is that you have pulled
back from the overly simple statement `The character Alice is greedy
and shortsighted` and obfuscated that with a situation or event that
allows the reader to understand that. These pullbacks are also useful
for genericizing types of events and situations, so that they could be
reapplied to other characters.

And so, these kind of pullbacks are essential to writing literature in
such a way that allows the reader theirself to search for your
meaning.  It makes it a bit harder, so that they spend more time and
energy trying to understand your art.  These kinds of pullbacks also
make your art a bit ambiguous.  It's clear you wanted to spark a
dialogue on `greed` and `myopia`, but now your readers need to discuss
amongst themselves what you actually wanted to say. When truly, you
wanted them to explore these themes or character traits because they
are complex and the reason you thought about them enough to inspire
art in the first place is because there is no "right" answer. Art that
is so direct & obvious doesn't inspire enough discussion and
investment of energy to last.

### Anonimyzed Characters

There is a kind of merger of characters with the mathematic concept of
type theory. That is, you'll find that, for the situations you want to
use to highlight your chosen themes, you're going to need characters
to fill various roles. If your characters are pulling off a heist and
one of them gets left behind, it could be any of them, but why should
you pick each one? The role is the character that needs to be left
behind, which is necessary for some future element of the plot.

So, if you've enumerated these generic situations and plot movements
that you want to use to construct your plot, then you can also create
anonymized characters to attach to specific situations.  This way, you
can evaluate characters for that role in that situation to find the
best fit.  Changing characters that are part of a scene can have
ramifications on dependencies to the story. E.G. the character that
gets left behind in the heist was originally supposed to be in a scene
just a bit later on, but now that's a plot hole and a dependency issue
to be resolved.

But anonimyzing the characters that are part of your scenes allows you
to be a bit more flexible with your story.  Because the imposition
limitations often sparks creativity, then by evaluating which
characters make the most sense for each scene and resolving the
dependency issues that arise by creating explanatory scenes, you're
actually augmenting your creative capacity. I've always found that
imposed limitations cause me to be much more creative than usual.

And so, if you have these anonimyzed characters, you might specify
some of their actions and reactions in specific scenes, but because
you haven't decided their identity, you can always merge them with
other characters to some extent.  E.G. well for scene A, we need a
heroic character that can rappel onto a balcony to save the day and
that matches up with character B.

### Character Archetypes

- character archetypes and traits. the "tsundere"
- character development: how to expose development to readers
  through events.  how to stress the character development without
  having it detract from more important points of the story.
  - will your readers honestly even notice that your character has
    changed?  what will draw their attention without expository
    dialogue?
  - IMO, most stories are too short for anything but the main 3 or 4
    characters to demonstrate meaningful character development.  but
    it's great when this is pulled off so that it's coherent.

- NOTE: also explain how and why sequels usually don't stand up to
  the first works.
  - (maybe move to the section on form)
  - it's mostly because the author didn't have another
    direction planned for the work.
  - the stories for the sequels feel "tacked on." they are
    self-contained and don't intertwine.
  - at the same time, it's a bit cheesy when there's a bit written
    into the story and you're like "oh i see where they want to make
    this a trilogy."  either way, the premise of subsequent work
    has changed the work.  planning the sequels out is preferable
    for sure though.
    - but sometimes, a story should begin and end. and that's it.
      you've explored the world.  time for a new story.
  - how to construct a story without "planning on the sequel." there
    is another way, through a certain kind of formlessness.  by
    constructing a story and adding enough extraneous material such
    that the original work feels both homogenous and heterogenous.
    - think of one of those automatic contextual photoshop brushes.
      how does it work?  it checks the surrounding area and fills in
      pixels so nothing stands out too much.  this is a bit similar.
  - also, when you mixin enough extraneous heterogenous detail into
    your story, it feels natural.  and when that's not there, it
    feels constricted, just barebones plot.

<a name="style"/>

## &#x2605; Style &#x2605; Major & Minor

you should be experienced enough as a writer (or artist or poet,
whatever) to consciously embed elements of style throughout it's
entire process of creation.  this way, the style you apply seems
uniformly embedded in the work, instead of a late idea or something
that requires a ton of edits and reworks.

## Part Two - Specific Themes

In the next part, I'm going to list some specific themes I'd like to
write about.  This
