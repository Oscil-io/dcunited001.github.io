## The Episaga

So, this is an excerpted chapter from a book that exists in the
future. This isn't just any normal book. This is a compendium of
myriad storytellers, forked and spliced to weave together hundreds of
stories, all rooted in a fixed point: the most perfectly visceral
experience of *true love*.

In fact, this kind of book only exists in the future. It's an
episaga. It's creators aren't authors. They are storytellers. This
eminates from my appreciation of the oral storytelling tradition and a
desire to return to the kind of myth that is more personal, more
human. There is no one single account of such a myth because that
would imply that such a story is perfect and what is less human than
perfection? I hope that authors can embrace this concept: the episaga.

There are a few rules and constraints I want to set for this
episaga. The first is a restriction on form: we start by hearing an
account of an event in the future, loosely defined in concept, time,
place, and role. As a reader, we know the story ends with this
chapter. Or maybe, this chapter is a midpoint in some greater
saga. Maybe it's a romance novel or a sci-fi thriller. Who knows. But,
I've always found that some simple, basic limitations envigorate
creativity.

When I actually pitch the episaga to authors, writers and
storytellers, I'll explain a few more constraints. Some others include
a loose restriction on themes and character archetypes. Another
constraint is explaining the title. I already have some great ideas
for the story I'm going to tell and the themes I'll cover. It's mostly
character-driven and there's not much plot. So, think Jessica Jones,
but with less plot and somebody gets laid ... wait, nope, nobody gets
laid.

I'm not sure what platform the project will be hosted on. I'm
thinking Github, but that might be a bit tough for authors, so I'll
probably pitch it on [hitRECord](https://hitrecord.org) as well.

#### Intellectualism Both Expands and Limits the Totality of the Human Condition

## True Love is Perfectly Visceral

I had a sudden inspiration to write down the perfect love scene. It
came to me on Wednesday. I was wondering why I've never had that *love
at first* sight experience. And then I thought, why should sight be
involved? Could someone fall in love without ever seeing someone?

What would that be like? My head started spinning. Out of all the
senses, my least favorite must be vision. People with vision are much
more superficial. Think about it. If you can't see, then your
experiences delve quite further below the surface. You wouldn't
instantly dismiss someone based on their physical appearance, for
example. You wouldn't visibly react to visual occurances or need to
suppress a conditioned response that indicates superficial thoughts.

Obviously someone who can't see has challenges in life. But if we
learn to react to more than just our eyes, we would all be better for
it. Vision is such a strong, restrictive sense. Visual images can be
instantly recognized. Computer vision requires intense processing and
so does human vision. I discuss these ideas a bit more in
[Epistemology, Cognition and Category Theory: A Model for the Mind](http://te.xel.io/posts/2015-08-23-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-two.html).

### A Once in a Lifetime Experience

一期一会 - いちごいちえ - Ichi Go, Ichi É

This concept from Japan and Zen Buddhism refers to the nature of such
stellar once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-an-age events. But, there's a
dual truth embedded here, which is so often the case with zen sayings.
The dual notion here is that *every experience* is a once in a
lifetime experience and we should cherish all moments as having equal,
infinite *potential* for: astonishment, bewilderment, amusement,
vibrant connection.

However, if you knew that you were in the middle of your
once-in-a-lifetime experince, what would you do? If the goddess of
luck and fortune, Tyche, handed you a blank check, what would you do?
If everything you had ever wanted -- or better, yet, everything you
hadn't been capable of imagining -- appeared right in front of you,
could you ride that lightning? So, this first chapter is the summary
of such an experience.

So this is a story about life as experienced as a somewhat tangled
lanyard of threads and subthreads. As the mind processes experience
into memory, it marls this rope to emotional or situational
touchstones. Then, it layers down aggregate, self-produced information
on top of those memories, in addition to (and supplanting) the memory
of that sensory experience. These behaviors of the mind are often
noted as what causes witness testimony to change so dramatically,
immediately after an experience.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that David Foster Wallace was a
genius in the way he wove together various threads & subthreads for
Infinite Jest ... even though I've only read like 50 pages so far. In
a way, I want to imitate that style with this work. In a way...

## American Eros: Or How to Fell a Souley

### Chapter One

I never thought I'd have that once in a lifetime experience ... but it
happened, so fast, so illustriously fast. It wasn't love at first
sight. I fell in love the instant I heard her voice, before I turned
to see the angel whose radiance my presence was most certainly
robbing of vitreosity. And brilliance.

It was the unexpected tap on the shoulder. And her voice. It was her
voice. Those words in that instant. It led my heart to awaken. Somehow
the cymatic resonance managed to loosen and disperse the enigmatic
mist masking my own light, between layered neuroses and defense
mechanisms self-applied. Acquired, unconsciously cobbled together to
protect myself from fear of failure and reaching out. My subconscious
so perfectly destroys any chance of relationships from forming with
its own excellent Ninja Warrior obstacle course of self-sabotage.
These are undesired. Most definitely not meant to be understood, if
ever shown to my observer at all. The observer, the one who
witnesses...

(the observer can't see this, but designed it? need to explain)

Not even my own radiance could pierce those layers of detrimental
self-depricating defense mechanisms. Instead, there's only a faint
aura, an indication of black-body radiation, coupled with what must
certainly contain blistering heat. (from contained energy) Ne touchez
pas! [additional generic language warnings for hot coffee] But I
wonder, what would the world see if the self-imposed restraints
marring my heart's light could be released? What would my observer
see? Could he see himself, as he truly is? Who cares what the world
thinks. That lil guy needs a mirror.

But who is that anyways? Does the same observer follow me around? For
life? World's worst jobs. What is identity anyways? What is
consciousness? Where does it begin and end? Is there any such barrier
surrounding my own consciousness, separating me from others? Or is the
illusion of separation just that ... an illusion? Cyclical references,
I know. I'm a sucker for racing down the hamster wheel of circular
logic. It's the journey that matters most, right?

Why would you ever want to arrive? Life is about coming and
going. Coming and going. That's all. But what happens when time
disappears? What does that feel like? Am I feeling that right now?
Suddenly, the sound of a single teardrop, but oddly without
reverb. Did it come from within -- my heart skips a beat and a rush of
blood to the head. The dawn sunlight suddenly stops casting shadows
and instead everything is refracted as mother of pearl. The shadows,
the light. A brief, brilliant flash of the essence of beauty itself. I
can't tell (if this came from the light, from the sun). Or maybe this
pearling refraction emerged from within myself. Did she see it too?
Was she looking for it?

That rush of blood to the head, just now. Incredulous. What was that?
Was the restraint released from my heart? Impossible. It's like a
vault. I designed it that way. Or my observer did. Was it him? Whoever
enshrouded it, they built a daedalian labyrynth for a reason. They
gave Icarus wings, but kept him locked in a maze. They warned him, but
knew he'd rise and fall anyways. Or wait, that's not right. No that
wasn't Icarus. If he had wings, he'd just fly out. Whoever it was, if
he could just see the maze...

[kinda too much content for a brief flash]

Another heartbeat. No, that can't be right. What was I doing? Her
voice? Who was it? I didn't know her. Or did I? My subconscious starts
comparing the imprint in my phonological loop, restreaming it and
transforming it in the endohelian cortex, trying to understand: who's
image is this? Not image, but voiceprint?

My observer is unaware, but my subconsious halts all other background
processes, solely to resolve this one question. Do I know her?

Instantly, my subconscious has accessed the voice prints of everyone I
know or ever passed by. (every x,y,z) I would not realize it until
years later, but in that brief instant, some part of my mind processed
and comprehended a record of every single person's voice I'd ever
heard. Why? Why was her voice so different? What could provoke such a
surge of introspection?

And completely missed by my consciousness, my observer. If I'd seen
this girl, even for a second, that self-saboteur would deploy a mental
labyrinth. He'd change everything, distort it, ruin it. *Why couldn't
I just enjoy the beauty of life as it is?* Understanding, knowledge,
comprehension... it's all necessary. It's vital. But all that
information is baggage. It fogs the lens of our mind's eye like
trapped condensation, no doubt smearing every single photo we upload
to that great facebook in the sky.

For just a brief moment in time, and perhaps most importantly, it was
our hearts that met first, not our eyes. It transcended space and the
material world. (moreso for me than for her ... that's what she said
..) And her brilliance disassembled any masking still darkening my
heart. It's as if some tendril of her ethereal being reached through
that labyrinth and dispersed (its ?? fragments into spacelessness). Or
maybe through sheer elegance, pierced it like a blade to gossamer. The
connection I felt, it's as if she saw through to my heart's radiance
and found something that I myself had buried and forgotten. (Without
sight at all). (too much emphasis on lack of sight? need to be less
direct about it)

Another heartbeat, but my racing mind had lost count. Faster.
Everything seemed faster. The energy rippled through my veins, my
blood warmed. My mind vanished and I melded into the universe.

There's a club for those people with perfect relationships who fell in
love at first sight. I've never been invited to that club, always
peering in from the outside. So I formed my own club. It's way
better. I fell in love, without first sight. But when I say I fell in
love, I truly mean that the earth, the stars, they fell around us. The
universe surged with orgasm and gravitational radiation echoed loudly
as the world transfigured itself to spite fate. A nuclear burst of
energy, powered by fate's chains. No matter what had happened before,
fate lost it's power for a brief moment. All its intensity to grip and
control life and transfix our destiny.  All of that energy suddenly
fed back into itself.

And thus, this is how the universe became philocentric. In one sudden
moment, the earth, the stars, they fell around us. Love became the
center of the universe. We became the center of the universe. Nothing
else mattered. The fruit of fortune and fame bloomed in front of us,
green hues shifting to red. Tantalized. Still so tantalizing.
Outpacing the warmth still filling into my fingers, my hands (red)
from dialation, the perspiration seeping out of my palms. Something so
perfect. Nothing perfect needs anything added or removed. How do I
reach out? How do I take it? My palms are probably glistening with
sweat. What if I can't hold onto it?

But I felt it. Nothing can confirm your destiny to yourself as
strongly as feeling the foundation of your fate shifting tectonically
beneath your feet. You literally move. You feel it. The ground jumps
beneath you. And this deafening transmogrification of your destiny, it
can't be denied. And I felt it.  Here. Just now. Every star in the
milky way thrust its mass hopelessly against the chains of fate.

Two new friends dared dream that illusion of separation the world over
could be ended.
