## The Episaga

So, this is an excerpted chapter from a book that exists in the
future. This isn't just any normal book. This is a compendium of
myriad storytellers, forked and spliced to weave together hundreds of
stories, all rooted in a fixed point: the most perfectly visceral
experience of *true love*.

In fact, this kind of book only exists in the future. It's an
episaga. It's creators aren't authors. They are storytellers. This
eminates from my appreciation of the oral storytelling tradition and a
desire to return to the kind of myth that is more personal, more
human. There is no one single account of such a myth because that
would imply that such a story is perfect and what is less human than
perfection? I hope that authors can embrace this concept: the episaga.

There are a few rules and constraints I want to set for this
episaga. The first is a restriction on form: we start by hearing an
account of an event in the future, loosely defined in concept, time,
place, and role. As a reader, we know the story ends with this
chapter. Or maybe, this chapter is a midpoint in some greater
saga. Maybe it's a romance novel or a sci-fi thriller. Who knows. But,
I've always found that some simple, basic limitations envigorate
creativity.

When I actually pitch the episaga to authors, writers and
storytellers, I'll explain a few more constraints. Some others include
a loose restriction on themes and character archetypes. I already have
some great ideas for the story I'm going to tell and the themes I'll
cover. I'm not sure what platform the project will be hosted on. I'm
thinking Github, but that might be a bit tough for authors, so I'll
probably pitch it on [hitRECord](https://hitrecord.org) as well.

#### Intellectualism Both Expands and Limits the Totality of the Human Condition

## True Love is Perfectly Visceral

I had a sudden inspiration to write down the perfect love scene. It
came to me on Wednesday. I was wondering why I've never had that *love
at first* sight experience. And then I thought, why should sight be
involved? Could someone fall in love without ever seeing someone?

What would that be like? My head started spinning. Out of all the
senses, my least favorite must be vision. People with vision are much
more superficial. Think about it. If you can't see, then your
experiences delve quite further below the surface. You wouldn't
instantly dismiss someone based on their physical appearance, for
example. You wouldn't visibly react to visual occurances or need to
suppress a conditioned response that indicates superficial thoughts.

Obviously someone who can't see has challenges in life. But if we
learn to react to more than just our eyes, we would all be better for
it. Vision is such a strong, restrictive sense. Visual images can be
instantly recognized. Computer vision requires intense processing and
so does human vision. I discuss these ideas a bit more in
[Epistemology, Cognition and Category Theory: A Model for the Mind](http://te.xel.io/posts/2015-08-23-epistemology-cognition-and-category-theory-part-two.html).

### A Once in a Lifetime Experience

一期一会 - いちごいちえ - Ichi Go, Ichi É

This concept from Japan and Zen Buddhism refers to the nature of such
stellar once-in-a-lifetime or once-in-an-age events. But, there's a
dual truth embedded here, which is so often the case with zen sayings.
The dual notion here is that *every experience* is a once in a
lifetime experience and we should cherish all moments as having equal,
infinite *potential* for: astonishment, bewilderment, amusement,
vibrant connection.

However, if you knew that you were in the middle of your
once-in-a-lifetime experince, what would you do? If the goddess of
luck and fortune, Tyche, handed you a blank check, what would you do?
If everything you had ever wanted -- or better, yet, everything you
hadn't been capable of imagining -- could you ride that lightning? So,
this first chapter is the summary of such an experience.

So this is a story about life as experienced as a somewhat tangled
lanyard of threads and subthreads. As the mind processes experience
into memory, it marls this rope to emotional or situational
touchstones. Then, it layers down aggregate, self-produced information
on top of those memories, in addition to (and supplanting) the memory
of that sensory experience. These behaviors of the mind are often
noted as what causes witness testimony to change so dramatically,
immediately after an experience.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that David Foster Wallace was a
genius in the way he wove together various threads & subthreads for
Infinite Jest ... even though I've only read like 50 pages so far. In
a way, I want to imitate that style with this work. In a way...

### Chapter One





ending with: ...

hmmmm .... ? maybe. this sets up a more epic storyline for other people

Two new friends dared dream that illusion of separation the world over
could be ended.
