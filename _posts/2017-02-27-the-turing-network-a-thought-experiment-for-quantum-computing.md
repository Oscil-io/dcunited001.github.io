# A Turing Network?

Where did this idea come from? From reading papers on the smart-grid
and imagining self-healing smart-grid infrastructure.

Imagine your standard Turing Machine, but something a bit
different. Instead of maintaining program state in the a tape with
discretized values, this Turing Network instead processes waveforms
where state can be encoded in various ways, including in spectral
transformations. And this is a network, not a simple machine, where
state is distributed amongst various autonomous Turing Machines.

### Why Does The Turing Network Matter?

If you are a computer scientist, then a Turing Network is a
fascinating thought experiment. It's a generalization of a problem
that seems relevant to quantum computing, where some state is
entangled amongst otherwise autonomous processes.

The traits distinguishing this hypothetical programming problem
from a simple Turing Machine are:

#### (1) There is a network or graph of devices: a Turing Network

#### (2) They are connected together signaling using only electronic waveforms, so the speed of transfer of information is optionally relevant

#### (3) There is optionally, a universal clocking mechanism which can be assumed to be accurate.

#### (4) The electronic components and signaling used are optionally relevant, but should only be considered relevant by masochists.

#### (5) Optionally add to each node a quantum FTL networking connection that surpasses the speed of light

So you have a network of variously connected devices sharing the
distribution of a waveforms between various electric channels. Again,
the tape in this Turing Machine is the waveform, which the nodes of
the network are programmed to modify. The nodes are connected in a
graph that allows them to communicate using the waveform. It

The programs in this case are the behaviors of each node in response
to inbound data from a waveform, which modify it and retransmit it
along outbound edges to other nodes. The timing/positioning of the
nodes on the electric network matter. Like any Turing program, the
values encoded onto the wire depend on how the program processes
values previously read into the program.

### Questions posed for a Turing Network:

#### (1) How difficult is it to get the assumptions from Turing Machines to hold for a Turing Network?

#### (2) How does one architect and program a Turing Network to simulate a single Turing Machine?

#### (3) Can a turing network, with nodes paired with the appropriate programs, always have a formulation that allows for [Turing Completeness]() and/or [Turing Equivalence]()?

#### (4) How do the traits mentioned above affect the design of Turing Networks?

This Turing Network is an incredibly useful thought experiment for
engineers considering a career designing the Smart Grid. There are
tons of papers on the smart grid that discuss various means of
coordinating electric infrastructure. Many papers mention the usage of
machine learning. If you think about it, the smart grid is very
similar to this problem. The nodes receive signals that inform them of
grid state and then signal coordinated changes to the grid, altering
network behavior, sometimes resulting in dramatically variant network
graphs.

An incredibly complicated problem: true self-healing smart-grid that
dynamically identifies the most efficient circuits to act as a conduit
for electrical power while maintaining security and redundancy.  Such
a smart grid requires distributing state across millions of devices to
coordinate concerted network behavior to distribute power and
accurately collect analytics, which are critical for Climate Change
policy.

### An Extension to Programming in Dynamical State Machines

How does one extend this Turing Network idea to the idea of a
probabilistic, genomic program based on dynamical state machines? In
the case of the Turing Network, the nature of the "space" is very
different than the cartesian space used in genomic programs: one is
operating inside the topological space within the graph representing
the Turing Network.

So, since topological spaces are analogous to cartesian space, what
connections can be made from Turing Networks based in graph theory to
[Dynamical State Machines](https://www.google.com/404.html) that
spatially distribute state over a kind of
[state space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process#State_space)
mapped on top of 3D cartesian space.

This
[Dynamical State Machine Programming paradigm](https://www.google.com/404.html)
should carry over to networks where space is not cartesian and, in
this case, the paradigm will be incredibly useful for artificial
intelligence. A proper name for this paradigm escapes me. Stochastic
Programming is a thing. Probabilistic Programming is a thing. Dynamic
Program is a thing, so all the good names are taken. This thing is
different and it's utility and applicability to AI and genomics cannot
be adequately stated. The nature of this programming paradigm is
likely why
[Roger Penrose states that "human consciousness is non-algorithmic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind). This
programming paradigm can never guarantee infinite loops because
everything is an event with probability between zero and one.

In the case where a
[Dynamical State Machine](https://www.google.com/404.html) program is
distributed across nodes in a Turing Network, it would seem that the
"rules" for program behavior are tightly coupled to the structure of
the network itself. That is the behavior is coupled to the the spatial
fabric of the graph itself. This ties into
[representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory)
(i think), where one can represent any graph as a mapping to other
graphs, such as
[Cayley graphs](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CayleyGraph.html) or
[Complete Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph). The
program would need to adapt itself to various network topologies. If
the underlying network topology changes, this would cause vastly
different behavior unless the program could anticipate the change.

### The Turing Network is Closely Related to Quantum Computing

This thought experiment, the Turing Network, is closely linked to
quantum computing and is an interesting analog to a Turing Machine for
quantum computing. Thinking about his makes me appreciate how powerful
technology is and makes me wonder where all the hyperintelligent
people are in my life.

### TODO:

- turing network used by neurons to communicate data encoded into
  spectral components of neural spikes?
- can any program be converted into a probabilistic program that
  approximates the program?
- can any combinations of particles in space be represented as a
  special type of graph?

#### Wherefore [Erdős Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number)? There for nothing?

What am I here for, anyways? Why am I tormented for the gifts of
creativity, intelligence and perseverence? Why does it appear that I'm
fated for oblivion?
