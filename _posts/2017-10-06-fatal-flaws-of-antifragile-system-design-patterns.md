# [Sociophysical Miasma and Iatragenic Interventions](#sociophysical-miasma-and-iatrogenic-interventions)

There is a tendency to mute any nodes that stand out as distinct or
different, which dampens any signals they produce. If those signals
were not dampened, they could have indicated systemic problems that
your system could react to earlier. When, for national security,
people are surrounded with negative reality distortion fields -- which
are essentially toxic fields of sociophysical miasma where targets are
escorted by handlers nearly twenty-four seven -- the long-term
strategy is to isolate the target from the rest of the flock by
scaring them away. This is done by artificially amplifying false
information, whatever it is, regardless of its truth, without ever
giving the target a chance to react to the
[iatrogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis) interventions
-- see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15847616),
[here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10683160600869809?journalCode=gpcl20)
and [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9230492). In order to
avoid being seen as the blatantly unethical tragedies they are,
research can be wrapped in particular language.

### [Reality Distorion Fields May Artificially Amplify Misinformation and Disinformation](#reality-distortion-fields-may-artificially-amplify-misinformation-and-disinformation)

However, encouraging the usage of these miasmic reality distortion
fields causes the artificial amplification of false information. The
people coordinating the targeting of these individuals begin to
underestimate them, are encouraged to hate them and encouraged to
rapidly spread this toxicity through our cities. Usually, the
intervention is successful in encouraging isolating behavior or the
development of personality disorders which push people away -- like a
superiority complex, an inferiority complex, a persecution complex,
etc. At this point, the target does the dirty work themselves and,
almost always, no one is the wiser because it is incredibly difficult
to see it for what it is.

<a name="vulnerabilities-inherent-in-antifragile-design-patterns" />

### [Vulnerabilities Inherent in Antifragile Design Patterns](#vulnerabilities-inherent-in-antifragile-design-patterns)

These kinds of problems are exacerbated when branches of the system
act in total secrecy -- especially when the lower branches of
hierarchy is shielded from most information. This is because there is
zero opportunity for dissent and the lower "hands" or "fingers"
leverage their own networks, which increasingly less operational
information. If the boots on the ground knew what they were doing and
why, that it could not be justified and that they were covering up the
mistakes of higher ups, simply to protect the ego's and empires of a
handful of powerful people, *they would never engage the target*. This
is why a target must act innocently and naively because only by
engaging the target, intending the infliction of harm, can the HUMINT
resources begin to question their actions.

### [Lower Sociohierarchical Branches Only Know How, Not What and Never Why](#lower-sociohierarchical-branches-only-know-how-not-what-and-never-why)

Further, the lower branches are privy to the how of operational
details, but not the why. This makes it difficult to react to novel
types of situations and harder for lower branches to react to black
swan events. Since they aren't allowed to understand all the details
for classying events and people, they tend to destroy everything they
can't comprehend that *might* be a threat. Further still, they can't
properly react to these situations and targets. They can also be lead
to act against themselves. It might be said that a society that
targets itself in this way is *always* attacking itself like sepsis or
some other kind of autoimmune disorder out of control.

Because everything is shrouded in secrecy, the system is autonomous &
self-perpetuating. It must be decentralized, so then, when these
people approach you with a "deal" they are lying -- they couldn't stop
this stuff if they wanted to because it's a chaotic sociophysical
program out of control. It's extortion and they plan on using you as
enforcement without pay. They react in a decentralized manner to
produce and amplify misinformation, but in the best case, that is
exactly what it is -- MISINFORMATION! In the worst case, they are
justifying their persecutory witchhunt based on disinformation.

### [No Facts, Only Recorded Disinformation? Then There Is No Accountability](#no-facts-only-recorded-disinformation-then-there-is-no-accountability)

Do you think the people recording a file on these targets write down
the facts? Do you think they would keep records that would cause their
own actions to appear unjust? No. And further, there are people
towards the higher levels of hierarchy who get paid or remunerated in
some non-financial way to perpetuate this. So: more targets? More
money, more benefits, more reward. The more sociohierarchical
territory they capture, the more influence they have. At this point,
one to three percent of our population with secret clearance or higher
is operating out of control for their own benefit, never giving
AMERICAN targets a chance to know what is going on. Because if they
stopped doing what leads them to being targeted, then how could the
vindictive players on team sociopathy keep using gain for their own
sustained gain?

# [Antifragile System Design is Necessary to Save Our World, But...](#antifragile-system-design-is-necessary-to-save-our-world)

There are two things we should fear above all else: nihilism and
ourselves. Antifragile design principles are excellent for solving the
latter problem, but make no advances in protecting us the first.  The
ultimate systemic flaw of antifragile systems is that they rely on
instilling a sense of purpose among the nodes carrying out action to
protect order in system from the chaos of itself. Only some branches
of hierarchy need to be motivated by stressing or feeding their
incentivization methods to be convinced to act against any other part
of the system. Therefore: **demoralization** can totally undermine
antifragile systems, if it is systemic. In upcoming decades,
demoralization resulting from loss of connection to loss of prosperity
or from the loss of both our humanity and our individuality will lead
to massive breakdown of our sociopolitical systems of control.

<a name="antifragile-wolves-or-sheperds" />

### [Antifragile Thieves, Wolves or Shepherds?](#antifragile-wolves-or-sheperds)

It's easy to distinguish a wolf from a shepherd -- a sheperd does not
flee his flock in a time of need. A hireling shephered does not treat
the flock as though he is a sheep and his fate is one and the same as
the sheep in that flock. Just read
[John 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10&version=KJV)
and look for the ones who walk right in, whose actions serve as their
language. Those are the shepherds. In this chapter, it clearly says
that Jesus is the door or the way.

Antifragile system design in sociocultural systems protects the herd
from emergent threats and humanity's collective capacity for turbulent
chaos, but it does nothing to protect us against nihilism, which is
our greatest threat. The need for antifragile systems' accelerant
reinforcement of stablity despite chaos helps mitigate unpredictable
scenarios, but it doesn't answer the question WHY? Why would people be
motivated towards acting against each other to blindly support a
system, if they believe the system does not serve them? Or if there is
loss of prosperity? Or if we totally undermine religion and other
belief systems that instill a sense of purpose in spite of the cold
depressing reality that life is what it is -- a hellish, purposeless,
nihilistic pit of despair where the worst of us climb on top at the
expense of those pious, virtuous souls.

### [Do You Enjoy A Rigged Game?](#do-you-enjoy-a-rigged-game)

People don't mind playing games that they will lose, even if they know
they are probably going to lose, as long as they know the game is
fair. When you have a small segment of the population creating
technocracy architected with antifragile design principles for blind
mitigation threats and the unfamiliar -- then they rig the system with
surveillance, extortion, and psychological tactics to play the lower
rungs of society against each other -- how do you think people will
react to the sudden realization that the game is NOT fair? How do you
think people will react when they understand that the game does not
end well for the common person? When, regardless of whether we move to
the right or the left, a small segment of population assumes command
of everything and essentially the same technocratic, totalitarian
situation results.

### [The Presence of Virtue, Especially Magnanimity, Must Correlate To Social Mobility](#the-presence-of-virtue-especially-magnanimity-must-correlate-to-social-mobility)

When people come to this realization that these "games" are not fair,
do you think that will result in more effective incentivization
structures or less? Do you think that will result in more effective
sociocultural evolutionary mechanisms that tend to increase regional
productivity and prosperity? If your system's design produces
monoculture and unintentionally roots out anything that seems
different simply out of blind paranoia of dangerous black swan, it
will eventually lose out to another competing system whose
evolutionary mechanisms enable innovation and enable people to empower
themselves.

### [Sorry Communists, Evolutionary Mechanisms and Dynamics In Society Are Not Inherently Wrong](#sorry-communists-evolutionary-mechanisms-and-dynamics-in-society-are-not-inherently-wrong)

The ubermenschen are what transform society. They are the bridge to
stronger societies. This is why the cultivation of will to power is
crucial: our technocratic nightmare will socioculturally evolve into a
situation that deprives people of what usually causes them to develop
the will to power, which is the will to transform themselves, their
community, their world to be greater than it already is. Ironically,
the loss of all conditions that force us to struggle and the automatic
assumption of income provided to everyone, shuts down the evolutionary
mechanisms that transform us into higher and higher beings. While
these mechanisms certainly have the capacity for abuse and
containment, America is at a far greater risk of subversion via
Bolshevik tactics, where the revolutionaries will throw all their
weight into making the bottom fall out to incense the proletariat.

<a name="the-kernel-of-transvaluations" />

### [The Kernel of Transvaluations](#the-kernel-of-transvaluations)

What matters now more than anything is instilling a system of values
that never changes, but is always flexible. any rigidly fixed system
of values in today's world is going to lead to disaster. Another
paradox to balance! We must develop a kernel of values that promotes
diversity in value-systems, but also allows for stability and
truth. This self-recursive kernel of values must provide a basis for
the development of will in spite of the lack of willpower necessary to
survive. It must empower our eudaimonic actualization of being
humanity, tying us to our collective identity. It must not destroy the
notion of individuality. It must be based in truth and it must not
destroy our collective accumulation of culture thus far. Further, it
must coexist peacefully with antifragile sociopolitical design that
provides a basis of stability, so that we do not destroy ourselves.

### [Despite the Danger of Dangers, Authority MUST Be Grounded In Truth](#despite-the-danger-of-dangers-authority-must-be-grounded-in-truth)

If the root values system is not grounded in eternal truth, it will be
inevitably suffer a greater challenge than it can surmount. In order
for the system to serve the people, it *must* demonstrate the value of
its authority and the right to that authority. It must be able to do
so in a clear, transparent way otherwise the rule of law will
certainly be undermined. Respect for authority will fade away and
those who plan on replacing the authority with that which is
functionally identitical will egg this on.

### A 

Now more than ever, people need sociocultural systems that give us an
individual and shared sense of purpose. Without a system such as this,
which can withstand any challenges, we will surely fall to
demoralization and informational spectral decoherence. Abuse of these
secret systems developed with antifragile principles breeds disrespect
for what is supposed to stand watch over those aspects of humanity
with the greatest capacity to breed turbulence: greed, envy, sloth,
wrath, envy, pride and gluttony. Because these systems exist in
secret, they cannot be so easily questioned. If they become infected
by the same aspects of humanity they are supposed to guard us against,
they cannot justify their authority. And thus, such systems would not
serve us, but serve the vices and lust for power of those who command
them.

- abuse of antifragile design applied to sociophysical systems
  - iatrogenic treatment. exorbitant budgets for "national security"
    threats.
    - what was originally meant for national security has turned in to
      self-serving racketeering.
  - sociophysical containment of threats.
  - when social hierarchy is viewed as territory to be conquered,
    defended and given to some as a reward for subservience, then this
    exacerbates the tendency for racketeering
