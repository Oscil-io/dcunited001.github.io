This is a solution to the problems posed by conflict theory and Karl
Marx. It's actually my second post conclusively disproving Marx ... in
a month!

Human conflict is truly bourne from competition over resources. It is
sometimes driven by ideological means, but when you dig deep enough,
usually you find that ideology is reinforced and propelled as a means
of obscuring the true causes of conflict, often incovenient. This is
not to say that your chosen religion is an invention inspired by
control of humanity. Regardless, ideologies are often used centuries
after their invention as a means to unify regional populations for
better or worse.

This isn't a discussion of the merits and tragedies of religion. This
is a strategy to circumvent the factors precipitating conflict in the
first place. If acquisition and control over limited resources creates
the needs for conflict and the shapes or forms thereof, then what
happens as these factors themselves become scarce? What if the reasons
for war were themselves scarce?

As humanity externalizes their capacity for resource acquisition, we
will undergo major shifts in the driving factors that have seeded
conflict across the world from time immemorial. As scarcity for
resources is purged from memory for several centuries, humanity will
find that the multifaceted basis for conflict itself will be all but
eliminated. At that point, any conflict that should emerge may be the
result of some artificial system or ideology. Anyone who creates an
artificial shelled system to create conflict towards the pursuit of
power for the sake of power in a future era which would otherwise
contain effervescent peace and placidity is a real asshole, don't ya
think?

Also, nuclear war is for assholes. If you want nukes at this point in
history just because you want the political advantage conferred from
disarmament et alias, then you are an asshole. You're about to fuck it
up for everybody. That's the equivalent of dousing a country in
kerosine and dancing around with a match. Go fuck yourself. No one
else gets nuclear weapons. We could have peace and prosperity, but
nooo you had to have your goddamn nukes. Can we hurry up with fusion
so none of these assholes has an excuse to produce plutonium?! Also,
fusion tanks Iran's market for oil. Womp womp. VC lession #1 -- sell
while the price is high because it ain't going any higher. Thank
you. Cha ching. America can take that to the bank.

The degree to which these benefits from lack of resource constraint
are realized depends on the availability of untapped ores and minerals
on earth or in space. There are some celestial bodies whence it would
be unethical to harvest resources, depending on that body's capacity
for life, but there are a plethora of ores in asteroids, on the moon
and on mars.

No one knows truly what we can expect to find there, so we should err
on the side of caution.  Yet, nations and corporations should assume
that our tragic dearth of resources is transitive. At this point, it's
merely momentary in the context of humanity's history. Further,
humanity will find that in the face of technology, the global economy
will gradually revert to previous form, where nations are moreso
dependent on quantity and variety of resources and they'll find less
demand for finished and/or intermediate products imported from other
countries. Instead technology will supplant this demand by replacing
manufacturing methods. It is not so simple, but the specific
progression that global and national economies will undergo is far
from either certain or simple.

However, the lower classes will surely benefit from this transition
over the next three decades, driven by development and dissemination
of technology. The major concerns during this time will be economic
turbulence and uncertainty and if nations do not approach this period
with warranted caution and expected foresight, then changes will rivet
through existing socioeconomic institutions. Carbon taxing and the
solutions to global warming will help provide stablization and it is
for this reason that free-market and business-oriented types should
support such systems. Barring major disaster and after our
technological transformation -- around 2030 -- there will still
economic disparity, but that should begin to lessen worldwide, whereby
we can focus on unifying and expanding towards space.

As nano develops, so will our ability to develop space elevators,
whence we can exponeniate the harvest of resources for space, whence
you can expect wildly fluctuating commodity prices. You can bet on
that horse. What fascinates me is understanding how something as
trivial as the starting mass of a planet and therefore its gravity
stratifies the fates of intelligent life. Too much mass and not even
nano is capable of providing a reasonable escape from the fate of
overpopulation, life's common and innate enemy. Too little gravity and
IMO there is less restriction and need for common form or structure
for life, of which I'm not sure of the implications.

At this time, around 2050, when humanity has built out it's options
for efficiently harnessing the excess of resources available in
asteroids and elsewhere, we'll experience an unprecidented era of
peace. If we make it to this point. Think back sixty years to the
immediate aftermath of the Holocaust. Do you remember the devastation
of that period? That was that seventy years ago and the pain is still
with us. Six million people died. So, imagine, if you will, the
sociocultural implications of a 21st century holocaust or some variety
of disasters that eliminate all but two billion people by 2050. This
is a topic for another post, but compare that population's shared
social experience and burdened memory against the population of a
humanity in 2050 numbering 10 billion. The latter population found
ways to work together! Where would we find their energy and economic
output invested? In unity. In infrastructure. In prevention. In life
itself. What of the former population? They invested in war and
destruction. And what is more infuriating than conflict's capacity to
sow the seeds of further conflict.

So what have you, in 2050, if you find yourself amoung the former
population? War, destruction, tragedy and more of the same!
Furthermore, you now have the shared archetype of technological
disaster and ruinous war. What fosters ignorance and foments conflict
more than fear? In the context of FDR's quote, we should understand
this horrendous vision of a bizarro future, so that our children can
leverage it as indemnity and collateral on an investment of
immeasurable return. Imagine the disposition of the former and latter
populations: which one is better prepared to handle the future after
2050? The one with the quasi-diluvian, Noahide archetype of global
disaster? Or the population who invested in life and infrastructure?

As for this proposed era of peace stemming from the economic
resolution to the origins of conflict theory itself: why should this
era of peace begin in 2050? If humanity knows that it has what it
takes to reach this point, why should we let any transient trauma
cause us to veer from the course? If we don't remain focused, we may
find ourselves in a world burdened by sociocultural trauma and bound
by hatred arisen from decades of conflict. Instead, we should allow
our positive and negative visions of the near future to fuel our
transition, so that our destiny reflects our needs and desires. Who
wants to live in the world full of strife and ruin? I want a future
worth celebrating. So humanity should move forwards together, which
means we must first center ourselves and unite the world over. There
should be nothing worth impediment to humanity's progress towards
this.

Because the political and economic strategies of entire cultures are
shaped by the monetization of resources and the distributions of
benefits whereof, then if humanity should shape its actions today upon
the certainties of the near future, it may defuse certain tragedy that
might prevent us from reaching the stars in the first place. There
aren't many people, old or young, who would disagree with
that. Further still, if your nation is planning on holding out on a
stockpile of resources to monetize on scarcity between 2020 and 2050,
you might find yourself surprised when long-held pricing patterns are
broken for specific natural resources, especially rare-earth and other
scarce ores. So if you want to adequately monetize those resources,
you might was to do so now. That doesn't mean it'd be wise to squander
them now either. And there seem to be many regions that are
artificially limiting the monetization of such resources.

On a global scale, it may be better if supply is generally increased
until such a time when importation of space-based resources will
definitely increase supply and reduce price, albeit in some unknowable
way. Space-based resources are going to be huge, but it's difficult to
ascertain exactly how until we can more easily quantify those
resources. Fusion, whenever it so happens to arrive, will reduce the
demand for fossil fuels, though not completely. Even though fusion
itself is cheap energy, it's not equivalent to cheap energy
distribution or responsible energy utilization and requires massive
infrastructure changes.

# Past, Present and Futures

Time, history and our understanding of past, present and future can be
imagined per analogy with the
[light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone)
[cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space#Causal_structure)
from special relativity. Via a chain of causality, our understanding
of the past can affect events in the present, but so can our past
understanding of the future. So, in a wierd way, the future does exert
causalation in the present, especially if the future is certain or
perceived as inevitable.

It's universally true that those who control the past control the
future via the present. Thus, the victors who write history have
immense power. Further, it's also true that those who envision the
future guide the present and therefore control the future past. À la
recherche du temps perdu, we should motivate ourselves with both
positive and negative visions of the world to search the available
futures and create the one we want, instead of finding ourselves lost
in some post-apocalyptic future. This philosophical approach
inevitably leads to the corrosion of individuality, so the challenge
is to leverage this so, without letting ourselves forget the
importance of individuality to avoid succumbing to nihilism.

In order for a society to reenforce individuality, the individual must
rewarded. Otherwise, we risk systemic corrosion to society's means of
behavioral feedback. Or the sociological limbic system, so to speak.
Nihilism begets demoralization and a clockwork orange scenario
ensues. It's urgent to recognize and preempt this philosophical
problem in the face of our technological revolution, as more societal
needs and demands are met by such means whereby the individual is
completely excluded. It's tragic in itself, but hopeless nihilism
unrestrained will probably lead to chaotic meaningless behavior from
actors who refuse to acknowedge their individual capacity to
contribute in a society that treats people as disposable units.

I certainly hope that I'm wrong about that, but if not, the world has
some serious problems because it's beginning to do exactly what I'm
warning about in the preceding paragraph. If so, I'm sorry, but I
truly do not understand what I did to deserve this and if I'm wrong,
why should someone who understands psychology, sociology and
philosophy to the degree that I do and feel that the world treats him
thusly? That, in itself, is a bit sad. Sorry to whine, but I need
three things to improve my life situation: (1) Nutrition and medicine
(2) Intellectual stimulation (3) Abundance and variety of social
experiences.

If a personal psychological treatment plan disregards my need for a
little extra understanding while I pick up the pieces yet again, then
it's unreasonable, poorly thought out, IMO poorly assessed and
possibly malicious. In other words, hoping that shocking someone with
the pain of "rock bottom" is not something that works for many people
and it's not something that would ever work for me. Ultimately, it's
just a convenient excuse to deprive me of resources and precisely
those types of social experiences which I would need to socially
develop. It's a rationalization I fear was pitched to my family that
they unfortunately believed. I might also require some extra help with
an acquired and intentionally exacerbated attachment disorder. This is
the fifth time in the past six years or so that I've had to put my
life back together and please excuse me, but I don't know anything
else! So in the context of Asperger's, please afford me little extra
space to be able to experience the things required for normal adult
development.

Also, did you know that there are like 800,000 people who have a
suspended license in Virginia? That's like 15% of the population in
the fucking state! They don't build roads here, they just take
people's licenses and ruin their lives. Although I can't say I have
much against the state of Virginia itself. Not at all, actually. Life
is pretty nice here, in spite of the fact that I need to drive to have
a life, but at least when you break Virginia's laws, they fucking tell
you and you go to court and you are very aware of what is happening to
you. It's when the state, it's laws or some asinine intelligence
apparati are leveraged against someone silently that incredible damage
can be done to one's life! And in such a way that few people become
aware of it. Even when someone criticizes or reprimands me, I actually
appreciate it because if your criticism has merit, then you're giving
me a chance to improve or change.

The most damage has been done to my life from words and actions
quietly sprung from malicious intention in a passive aggressive
manner. If you want to help me, then by all means, do so. If you want
to get in my way or sow the seeds of conflict or smear my personal
and/or professional reputation for whatever reason, then please
immediately get the fuck out of my life. You're a horrible miserable
excuse for a person because you can't possibly empathize with someone
who truly wants to help others, as evidenced by the post you just
read. GET THE !@#$ OUT OF MY LIFE.
