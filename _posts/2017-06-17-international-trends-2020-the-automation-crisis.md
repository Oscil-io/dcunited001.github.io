# [Inevitable Unemployment and the Resulting Liquidity Crunch](#inevitable-unemployment-and-the-resulting-liquidity-crunch)

There is an economic crisis brewing. As automation drives
unemployment, governments will be forced to respond with policy:
either Universal Basic Income or Employer of Last Resort. Regardless
of
[the economic and sociocultural merits of UBI versus ELR](/posts/2017-06-05-international-trends-2020-universal-basic-income.html),
neither policy is sufficient to stave off unemployment's effects on
revenue streams to banks. In turn, this triggers several downstream
effects, including a major reduction in liquidity available to banks
and a major slowdown in consumer and corporate lending. These effects
come at a poor time.

To cope with the unemployment and economic turbulence, developed
nations are compelled to borrow money to prop up the economy. The
greater the scope of entitlement programs, the more the currency must
be diluted in response. With numbers pulled directly out of my ass, by
2030, America could reach 20-100% annual growth of the national debt,
dependent on rates of unemployment and tax volume. Imagine the effect
that would have on currency markets, economic development and lending
institutions.

<a name="the-capacity-of-the-crisis-to-elude-understanding" />

### [The Capacity of the Crisis to Elude Understanding](#the-capacity-of-the-crisis-to-elude-understanding)

The upcoming crisis is unlike any before. Even though it shares many
of the same components, it is fundamentally different in ways that
will elude many economists. I do not have the data or the expertise to
predict how this will unfold, nor does anyone. It is not necessarily
disastrous for America or the global economy, but there is significant
potential for disruption. Again, it is not necessarily the magnitude
of the crisis which is worrying, but the acceleration in economic
trends along with qualitative aspects of the crisis that will cause itq
to elude understanding, triggering poor reaction among nations.

<a name="america-must-guard-the-economic-status-quo" />

### [America Must Guard the Economic Status Quo](#america-must-guard-the-economic-status-quo)

It's critical to keep in mind that America dominates the economic
status quo now. Therefore, all other powers have a greater incentive
to disrupt the status quo than we do in maintaining it. For them, it
is easier to disrupt than it is for us to maintain. Foreign interests
and information warfare have subverted American leftists into
attacking the fundamentals of American prosperity. They don't realize
that it is American prosperity that provides the possibility of
expansive social programs. Without these economic interests intact,
the question is no longer whether we should finance entitlement
programs, but whether we can at all.

<a name="why-is-this-crisis-different" />

### [Why Is This Crisis Different?](#why-is-this-crisis-different)

There isn't enough liquidity and wealth distribution for people to
keep up with their debt. Therefore, this is a deflationary depression
where inflationary measures are appealing to inject liquidity into the
economy and relieve unemployment. Such inflationary measures include
UBI and ELR. In doing so, the finance of budget deficits both with and
without credit drives inflation. These contribute to systemic
instability in global currency markets. But unlike most depressions,
various means of production should remain elevated through the use of
technology. Because of automation's inversion of labor markets, this
furthers income distribution disparity, since the profits fall into
singularly fewer hands. The 21st century economy rapidly converges
into the control of fewer because of the nature of information and
intellectual property.

If we don't play our cards right, constricted liquidity implies that
the outlook on economic expansion is bleak, so it cannot be assumed
that increased profits will lead to increased tax volume to finance
the governmental policy response. In this case, increased tax rates
will also be insufficient. The liquidity to invest in smart-grid
infrastructure and the development of emerging markets will be
restricted. Further complicating matters, nations often respond to
depressionary crises with warfare to artificially stimulate of
economic activity and expansion. This creates geopolitical instability
at the same time as global economic crisis.

The Singularity's technology trends drive the global economy to
converge towards a more final state. This crisis represents a
tumultuous transition towards economic convergence, but may spiral out
of control, especially without cooperation.

<a name="the-strongest-system-wide-dynamics" />

### [The Strongest System-Wide Dynamics](#the-strongest-system-wide-dynamics-in-this-crisis)

Artificial intelligence, fabriction and other technology drive
unemployment. High rates of unemployment drastically lower median
income in developed nations. These economies have higher debt
saturation on consumers, which ostensibly enables faster growth, but
this dependency on already established revenue streams leads to
greater surface area for systemic risk. These higher levels of debt
saturation lead to more severely constricted liquidity in situations
of lowered employment. The lost liquidity leads to fewer new
investments and less capability to develop economic opportunities to
rise oneself out of crisis.

As opposed to other crises, restoring income distribution cannot be
assumed to be possible through new employment opportunities. The
employment will never be restored. Therefore, social programs must be
sustained through high tax volume via highly profitable private &
state enterprise. That which cannot be supported through enterprise
must be borrowed or even literally printed by the government. However
it can be provided, the people will be asking for it and expecting
more of it. High levels of unemployment lead to lots of idle people
who vent their unrest on the internet and demand more expansive
programs.

The dependency on expansive social programs, debt-backed or not, leads
to currency stability issues. This resulting inflation leads to poor
performance in bond markets, which impedes debt security options for
central banking. In the past, currency dynamics were mostly restricted
to a small number of currencies at the same time in the global
system. Yet, here, you have these disruptive dynamics occuring
system-wide. Because of that, there is a high likelihood of several
simultaneous positive feedback loops in forex markets. These multiply
turbulence and cause massive amounts of wealth to evaporate. These
forex dynamics and massive redistributions of wealth will strongly
shape world politics.

All of these factors can lead to war, but the unpredictable, global
currency dynamics in particular. War & unrest lead to more of
both. These negatively impact the climate, fueling unpredictable
changes in agriculture and water availability, thereby influencing
real estate markets. Unpredictability in itself leads to behavior to
anticipate & mitigate unpredictability. Addressing climate change
requires limiting economic development through government spending and
diversion of liquidity.

Technology changes commodity markets and demand for resources. Those
with broader portfolios can spead out their risk amoung more foreign
direct investments, currency holdings and asset holdings. High
utilization rates on capital available to investors could limit
exposure to systemic problems in the currency markets.

<a name="ten-major-factors" />

# [Ten Major Factors](#ten-major-factors)

This is an overview of ten major factors that act as components to
the development and outcome of the crisis. These factors are not
listed in order of significance because the system is non-linear and
these factors effects, dynamics and magnitudes are thus
interdependent.

<a name="geoeconomic-dynamics-of-automation-and-unemployment" />

### [Geoeconomic Dynamics of Automation and Unemployment](#geoeconomic-dynamics-of-automation-and-unemployment)

From the perspective of a behavioral economist, this factor is the
most important in predicting the common person's response, both
financially and politically, as well as their needs at the time the
crisis begins unfolding in their nation and region. The geoeconomic
dynamics drives their change in economic circumstance, their overall
perception of the crisis and thus their political reaction to it.

The geoeconomic dynamics contribute towards dynamics which invert
globalization's impact on regional manufactoring, while decimating
labor markets. That is, American manufacturing is more likely to move
home, but that doesn't restore lost jobs or the disrupted wealth
distribution that accompanied globalization. (explain "inversion of
globalization"...)

How does the gradual impact to income distribution progress over
various regions of the US? Can the progression of unemployment be
accurately anticipated?

The impact on manufacturing, in particular, is constrained to the
phenomenological limits of artificial intelligence, 3D printing and
nano-technology. These are bounded by complexity theory and methods of
fabrication. For example, the nano-revolution is impossible when
materials like graphene and buckyballs can only be produced in
laboratory quantities.

- how does this impact developing nations?
  - what does it mean for a rising china?
  - what does it mean for America and the EU?

### [Policy Response: Strategy, Perception, Timing and Pacing](#policy-response-strategy-perception-timing-and-pacing)

- questions to answer:
  - what policy responses are available? UBI and national service
    - when considering policy response, what is the proper timing?
      what are the opportunity costs? How do we transition into policy
      implementation?

  - what policy responses are appealing?
  - delineate the explanation along economic, sociocultural and
    geopolitical dimensions
    - which options are appealing for developed/underdeveloped
      economies?
    - how does the economic state of a nation and its citizens
      affect the policy?

- (every major government's need for a policy response)
- the choice between UBI and national service
  - the costs/benefits of each will differ depending on how
    developed the nation's economy is.
    - highly developed with lots of cash: UBI will seem more appealing
    -
  - the governmental structure will partially determine policy
    - authoritarian governments can more easily compel people to
      conform to the policy response

  - in a democracy, the people's attitudes to being compelled to work
    - highly liberal? the inverse of kennedy's maxim prevails
      - ask what the government can do to fix your problems or bitch
        about it

- democracy's are highly disadvantaged because they cannot compel
  people to contribute to concerted economic strategy
  - additionally, the people are easily subverted against themselves
    by foreign powers.

- controlling the narrative
  - tighter control of information in general, especially of the
    response
  - this is why authoritarian countries are at an advantage here. They
    can leverage information to mitigate the range negative impact
  - unraveling net neutrality may be helpful in this regard, though
    ...

- A critical measure for domestic policy is the size of monetary
  supply in relation to annual federal deficits.
  - Inflation-driven economic policy is highly unsustainable and will
    tank the credit ratings of nations.

When debate over domestic policy is decided upon primarily emotional
arguments citing anecdotal needs to help the poor, how do we assess
sustainability of a developed nations' credit-driven policies?
Reliance on inflation-driven policy can be mitigated through higher
tax volume obtained through highly competitive enterprise. Still, in a
closed system, one nation's economic expansion comes at the cost of
another's lost opportunities to do the same.

<a name="commodity-markets-and-resource-distribution" />

### [Commodity Markets and Resource Distribution](#commodity-markets-and-resource-distribution)

The global economy becomes resource-bound. This defining trait becomes
more pronounced as we approach the singularity and the next technology
plateau. It's propensity to define dynamics in commodity markets
depends on the functional limits of fabrication technology. What is
clear is that more proficient fabrication leads to more self-reliant
economies, assuming they have the intellectual property and ability to
build out industrial capacity. Energy is required to offset entropy of
starting materials and industrial capacity is required to offset the
production time required for fabrication. (i.e. 3D printing and
nanotech are slow, therefore more industrial capacity is required to
offset time)

Supply chains then become more compact. Supply of ore and smelting
will always be required and probably most efficient closest to the
source. Fabrication's greatest impact is on the middle tiers of supply
chains.

Fabrication results in simplified logistics that result in dynamically
allocatable resources. You simply ship the raw or ready-to-fab
resources and then dynamically allocate them as goods when need. It's
like a cross between logistics and lazy evaluation a la functional
programming. Dynamically processible, ready-to-fab materials are more
useful.

- these trends in commodity markets contribute to dynamics in demand
  - what technology is capable of delivering determines what resources
    nations need and thereby determines demand.
  - (conflict theory)

<a name="technologys-impact-on-commodity-markets" />

### [Technology's Impact on Commodity Markets](#technologys-impact-on-commodity-markets)

The majority of uncapitalized opportunity in the next few decades
centers around materials science and the resulting intellectual
property. Both the import of resources from space and these new
fabrication technologies will strongly disrupt commodity markets.

Once fabrication achieves specific technological functionality
milestones, it always becomes more efficient to manufacture closer to
the consumer. The greatest questions are simply when fabrication hits
these milestones, what the phenomonological results of each milestone
are and who controls the IP and production capacity when each
milestone is reached.

With a bit of phenomonological calculus applied to technology (i.e.
reflecting upon fabrication's *phenomological ideals*), one assumes you
feed raw materials and time to developed industrial capacity in order
to receive finished product. The philosophic result is that the limits
imposed by space begin to dissolve as the initial distribution of
minerals accross the earth become paradoxically increasingly more and
less determinant of economic trends.

That is all philosophical, of which (the ideal) is meaningless without
knowledge of chemistry, physics and engineering. In order to make any
rational predictions about the nature of fabrication technology
requires an intimate knowledge of materials science, computational
chemistry and many other fields.

What can be known simply is that there are physical limits imposed by
counteracting entropy to transform materials. These fundamental limits
cannot be surpassed and bound any solution. There are technological
limits imposed by the transient capabilities of fabrication. There are
computational limits of the fabrication processes. There are economic
limits, resulting from the distribution of resources. In terms of
economic trends leading up to 2050, the distribution of resources
bounds, predicts and determines human economic behavior. If it weren't
for the possibility of resources in space, the system would be
completely closed. Still, who controls the production and distribution
of materials from space?

Higher commodity prices lead to development of resources from the
arctic, the seafloor and space. Greenland and Antarctica are
incredibly mountainous and their minerals are [probably]
untouched. Furthermore, proficient fabrication technology will lead to
a renaissance in garbage. All those landfills in third world countries
become like gold mines ... maybe. Of course, we'll also see the
obligatory gradual shift away from fossil fuels and towards
renewables, as nations posture themselves for energy independence.

### [Distribution and Control of Foreign Direct Investment](#distribution-and-control-of-foreign-direct-investment)

- technology's impact on globally allocated capital
  - It's cheaper to manufacture closer to the consumer. Doing so
    benefits the economy of the consumer while retaining competitive
    advantage and control over intellectual property related to
    industrial processes.
  - This could drive a minor modality that leads to divestment of
    foreign direct investment, but it's one of many dynamics.

- nationalization of FDI in national emergencies
  - or sale/redistribution of FDI assets after currency crash.

#### International Regulation of Supply Chains

- The effect on supply chain dimension of the American & Global
  Economies
  - reference arguments from article on regulating conflict minerals
    trade in african nations
  - elaborate on mechanics/dynamics of shifting supply chains
    - especially in the context of novel materials/fabrication tech

- The interantional regulation of supply chains will constrain
  investment behavior... (include this here?)
- Conflict minerals help finance destabilization and prevent economic
  development

- There is a fantastic Harvard ILJ article on this specific issue,
  which is absolutely fascinating. In terms of novel-information
  density (i.e. the percentage of content new to me) this single
  article may have accelerated my general level of knowledge more than
  any other writing I've ever consumed.
  - that is, this single article stimulated my own imagination more
    than anything else I have ever read and did so in terms of each:
    - number/kind of specific fields covered and the quantity/quality
      of new information
  - that International Supply Chain article isn't the only such
    article I've consumed in the past 3 months which has accelerated
    my acquisition of knowledge to personally unknown levels.
- TODO: what about it?
  - how is it difficult? how does international supply chain
    regulation affect cost structures, the incentivization of
    corporate behavior and foreign direct investment?

<a name="forex-dynamics-and-foreign-currency-reserve-distribution" />

### [Forex Dynamics and Foreign Currency Reserve Distribution](#forex-dynamics-and-foreign-currency-reserve-distribution)

Amidst the automation crisis, where most developed economies must
finance expansive entitlement spending with credit and printed
currency, this leads to turbulent and unpredictable forex
dynamics. These will be similar to those experienced around WW1 and
WW2. Strong political influences that emerge as a result of forex
markets, foreign currency reserve distribution and foreign debt
holdings.

The Dollar's status as the world's reserve currency will critically
cause the emergent political influences to be stronger and different
in quality than for other currencies. Groups with significant US debt
holdings or US currency reserves will attempt to influence American
policy to suit their interests. We should be willing to cooperate, but
prioritize our own interests first through forward-thinking economic
policy.

The effects of inflation on many currencies simulataneously will
result in stronger behavioral dynamics of groups with significant
currency reserves and debt holdings. High annual rates of inflation,
as measured by CPI or monetary supply, *will* result in unpredicable
turbulence in forex and debt markets. Depending on the policy
responses to high unemployment, the inflation trends in various
currencies and CPI's will occur at varying rates, which opens up
opportunity for speculation. Speculation on currencies will add to
the turbulence. Positive feedback loops in the turbulence of forex
markets, in the worst case, leads to runaway evaporation of wealth in
entire nations.

Normally, perturbations in forex markets are limited in effect, but in
this case, all developed nations will eventually need to finance the
living expenses of unemployed citizenry with government spending.

### [Bond Markets](#bond-markets)

The Federal Reserve influences credit markets through the sale of debt
securities. How does high inflation affect the willingness of the Fed
and banks to loan with low-interest, if they are expecting inflation
and/or significant forex fluctuations? High inflation negatively
affects the bond market because the yields are depreciated by it.

- the Fed buys bonds to inject liquidity into the economy, expecting
  to receive payment from bond issuers over the course of 10 or 30
  years.
  - the bond market responds poorly to inflation. This is bond
    investors receive less return on investment after bond yields are
    adjusted for inflation.
    - this means that the Fed is less able to leverage bond purchases
      to inject liquidity into the economy through the banking sector.
    - it can still do so, but can expect the bonds to perform poorly
      and thus is a bad decision
    - this feedback loop that inflation to limit liquidity via
      the bond markets.
      - additionally, this is happening at the same time that poorly
        serviced debt via unemployment restricts liquidity through
        constriction of bank reserves.

- TODO: how do macroprudential policies affect the crisis

<a name="distribution-of-debt" />

### [Distribution of Debt](#distribution-of-debt)

What happened during the 2008 housing crisis? The subprime housing
markets crashed and the lost revenue streams thereof triggered
cascading effects through the global banking system. But how did the
subprime housing markets crash? An economic downturn that impacted the
riskiest mortgage assets first.

Quite simply, there were people with mortgages who couldn't pay their
bills. This require shifts in allocation of liquidity to cover the
lost revenue streams, which triggered recession and thereby increased
unemployment, leading to more lost revenue streams in the housing
sector.

- The distribution of debt among consumers and businesses in America
  is critical. The greater the unmet debt burden, the greater the
  effects of such a crisis are to be when they emerge.
  - So, even if there is some policy like UBI that provides the
    *median income*, there will still be many people unemployed above
    the median income who are unable to pay their mortgages and debts.
  - As it intersects with the income distribution of the newly
    unemployed, this distribution of real asset debt (houses and
    cars), then triggers an impulse to sell amoung owners and mortgage
    holders. If you don't know what happens next, I'm not sure why
    you're still reading and I would guess that you're a liberal who
    decides their vote presented only with emotional arguments.

- Remember, in the best case, the government can maintain the median
  income, but without empire, it's impossible for the government to
  drive this median income up.
  - Are you a leftist who rails against American imperialism?
  - ...

<a name="entitlements-median-income-and-population-flux" />

### [Entitlements, Median Income and Population Flux](#entitlements-median-income-and-population-flux)

- How fast do disruption to income distribution and median income occur?
  - which segments of median income are disrupted first? (upper or lower)
  - which segments of the income distribution most severely disrupt
    revenue streams to banks?
- multiple measure of income distrubution: with and without government
  assistance
  
- (move?) the rate at which federal deficits expand will determine how reliant
  the government is on central banking, bonds, etc.
  - inflationary financial policy like this, driven at high rates in
    the 2020's, may increase the CPI faster than the monetary supply
  - this is because of cascading effects in how businesss price their
    products

> "Ask not what your government can do for you, but what you can do
> for your government."

What is the government obligated to provide to each citizen? What is
the government obligated to provide for non-citizens and illegal
immigrants? Did the government enact amnesty programs for illegal
immigrants? Did it do so because of a certain political party's
long-term strategy to use the votes to stay in power?

How much do people contribute to their regional or national economy in
return? How much can citizens who were formerly illegal immigrants be
expected to contribute to GDP and tax volume? So what is their net
contribution to the deficit? It should be expected to be higher than
that of legitimate citizens, though at most amnestees would account
for 5% of the population.

- But, at some point, we have to decide who is American and who is
  not. Who is our responsibility and who is not?
  - This is not in any way a distinction to be made on a racial or
    ethnic basis. Yet, we must decide who receives the benefits of
    American citizenship and who does not.
    - If the benefits are attractive, (describe people's response...)
  - This is a global crisis (expand...)

- Because the crisis inevitably results in inflation, (population flux)
  determines the severity of a currency's contribution to disruption
  to forex markets. (fix this statement)
  - in turn, this determines risk appetite and drives dynamics in
    deciding where to allocate foreign direct investment.
- Because the economic crisis cannot be lessened except through credit
  directly added to government balance sheets, the more spending that
  is required, the more credit a government will require.
  - Therefore, the more a government or party obligates itself to do
    and the more citizens it is obligated to provide for, the less it
    can do with the same amount of deficit.
- When this deficit is financed through credit, this furthers
  inflation. So therefore, the more people and the more entitlements,
  the faster these macroeconomic dynamics become toxic.

- There are major differences in how this kind of credit-driven policy
  affects the currency and behavioral economic dynamics.
  - In the nineties and the aughts, the credit stimulated the economy
    through the housing markets, which is a necessary means towards
    promoting home ownership. Therefore, if one manipulates housing
    prices and other aspects of the real-estate market, one can
    increase GDP and tax volume artificially through credit, when the
    credit is seen as necessary and sustainable.
  - When one begins to infuse a deficit ridden government with cash,
    it is not seen in the same light by creditors, investors and other
    backing nations.
    - The effects in floating your economy are, on the surface,
      similar, but this latter method is unsustainable. At this point,
      you are about as close to literally printing money as you can
      get if you're in charge of the world's reserve currency.

(rewrite) ultimately, if you want to reduce the severity of the
crisis, you have to reduce spending while there's plenty of
liquidity. that means we need to divert from spending in
general. again, that's so that we can invest in other things *while*
we have the liquidity because once unemployment hits critical levels,
we won't be able to do anything but print money.  what matters is
preservation of real value outside currency, so we need to invest in
global real estate, commodity, production via FDI, etc.  in this way,
we can weather the forex dynamics.

# [We Are Not Out of the Woods Yet](#we-are-not-out-of-the-woods-yet)

Just because the economy seems to have recovered from the 2008 crisis
doesn't mean that we're out of the woods yet. We need forward-looking
economic policy determined by where the global economy is
heading. Amid the uncertainty imposed by these ten factors, each
strongly defining how the crisis unfolds, the successful policy is not
reactive, it is proactive. It must drive trends and mitigate
uncertainty, while being strongly defined by exigent trends and the
Singularity's assymptotic finality of economic convergence.

as well as the tendency of the masses to be completey unaware of the
economic reasoning behind policy. Policy must also attempt to
construct the proper narrative moving forward, so that citizenry
living in democracy actively support it.

### [Avoid Hacking Economics for Short-Term Gain](#avoid-hacking-economics-for-short-term-gain)

When we hack the economy to optimize macroeconomic indicators, we
often delude ourselves into believing optimal indicators imply optimal
allocation of wealth.

That is, the common person assumes that the cash flowing around the
economy reflects strong economic fundamentals when instead Keynesian
economics allows "even out" economic turbulence by stimulating the
economy with central banking. The credit injected into the economy, in
turn, promotes economic growth. So when there's not enough liquidity
in the system, one uses central banks to pump it in.

- There's nothing inherently wrong with Keynesian economics, but
  there's a tendency for these policies to go horribly wrong. If we
  pump credit into the economy, but don't invest it in the right
  places, it's going make everything worse later on.

- We need to avoid the tendancy to hack the economy using Keynesian
  economics.
  - For example, the factors that led to the housing crisis were
    essentially an attempt to hack macroeconomic indicators to drive
    consumerism, maintain GDP growth and promote an artificial sense
    of prosperity that would lead to high spending.
    - the flood of cheap credit into domestic industries such as
      construction floated these industries and kept a healthy flux of
      liquidity flowing through the economy. this artificially
      increased employment, etc.
    - but if we are "banking" on these same strategies to float
      macroeconomics via injection of liquidity/credit, the more we
      depend on them, the greater this future crisis will be

### [Strategic Allocation of Liquidity in the 2020's](#strategic-allocation-of-liquidity-in-the-2020s)

  - We must assume that we have a finite amount of liquidity flux to
    invest in a platform for economic development before unemployment
    ends up restricting liquidity.
    - We need an economic engine that harnesses the differential in
      geoeconomic distribution of unemployment.
      - This sounds complicated but simply means that automation
        occurs in developed economies first, where the economic
        platform exists, but there is economic opportunity in
        developing that platform elsewhere.
      - So we can assume that developed economies will have a need to
        identify and compete over economic opportunity abroad.
  - (explain how this correlates to proper allocation of capital)

<a name="interest-rates-and-federal-reserve-policy" />

### [Interest Rates And Federal Reserve Policy](#interest-rates-and-federal-reserve-policy)

Interest rates will affect lending behavior, which can increase or
reduce the total consumer and corporate debt. When unemployment spikes
as a result of automation, these revenue streams must be accounted for
by diverting liquidity. So, if the total amount of debt that must be
accounted for is lower after a decade of lower interest rates, this
means less liquidity will need to be diverted later on.

It's not that a slowdown in lending via lower interest rates will be
necessary. It's that we need to make wiser investment decisions that
weigh the long-term economic consequences much more heavily than the
short-term. Lending institutions cannot simply conduct themselves with
the next quarter's results in mind.

### [International Economic Development](#international-economic-development)

In terms of maximizing profits, American and multinational banks will
almost certainly tend to avoid developing markets because of the
higher risk and lower returns, but if they do so, this doesn't
establish an economic platform that America can use to replace
liquidity in the 2030's.

### [Currency Market Stabalization](#currency-market-stabalization)

There's a strong need to artificially stabalize the currency markets
if we know there are to be problems in the future. After the crisis
begins, it is unlikely that we can coordinate nations to come together
and cooperate towards this end. They will be acting in their own self
interest under rapidly changing conditions.

- what can be used as force for forex market stabalization or correction
  - so that positibe feedback loops don't lead to problems

- international agreements for redirectable labor/development funds
  - to recorrect liquidity flows (so that some economies do not face
    the most severe effects of becoming liquidity bound)
  - how can a system like this be architected specifically to offset
    major forex turbidity?

- water and gold as two possible commodities (? meh...)
  - explain why...

- or a single currency shared across the world

### [Flexible Management of Existing Debt](#flexible-management-of-existing-debt)

- neither UBI/ELR accounts for consumers' need to maintain existing
  cash flows
  - therefore, consumers with jobs in those industries that are
    automated can no longer pay their mortgages, etc
  - this is another source of potential systemtic economic collapse,
    given high consumer debt appetite and poorly managed credit
  - make the home & garden channel illegal
  - encourage higher payment of existing debt, while the economy
    permits (except this is terrible in a consumer driven economy)

### Enslavement by Debt and Desire

- this all leads to a massive depression.
  - this is unlike any depression in history because, for those at the
    top, there is high growth and economic opportunity is plentiful.
  - but, for everyone else, there is no economic opportunity, except
    as artificially provided by the government or those with liquidity
    and a penchant for unnecessary spending.
  - in this depresson, people owe massive sums of debt that the
    economy (does not allow) them to pay. so, our credit institutions
    systemically stagnate. in severe cases, the borrower is unable to
    pay even the interest on their debts.
- the people examining UBI closely enough to spend millions on studies
  could not possibly be totally ignorant of this.

### Even With Inflationary Measures, There is Still Systemic Collapse

- The easy way out is by financing government policy, either UBI or
  some national service, using central banking.
  - Doing so causes inflation and lessens the magnitude of the
    depression.
    - This is because existing debts are easier to pay in the midst of
      inflation.
    - Think this strategy is popular with the financial elite or with
      countries who hold large quantities of dollars in reserve?
      - yeh ok. it's not. so think again, liberals. and maybe shut the
        hell up online while you're at it.
  - ultimately either strategy requires financing via debt through the
    Fed. However, the injection of liquidity is neither.

- because the only way to lessen the magnitude of the crisis is via
  inflation, investment in gold/silver is a good bet.
  - As this approaches, I'd recommend 1% of investment in gold/silver
    per 1% in unemployment.

### Student Loan Reform is Reasonable, Innovation in Higher Education is Preferable

- The actual value of college education is much lower than the price.
  Especially looking forward, one can see that there is less incentive
  to become indebted for a college degree.

  - it is impossible to avoid a convergent economy, where the wealth
    converges into an asymptotically smaller number of hands
  - garbage in, garbage out

### Policy Must Account for Disinformation in the Age of Social Media

We must keep in mind the shifting nature of information amid social
media, as well as the difficulty in avoiding complete communist
revolution. Hyperconnectedness and the light-speed velocity at which
ideas travel on the internet disrupt our ability to discern
causality. That is, no one can determine cause and effect in political
or sociocultural affairs. Therefore, it's anyone's game when
constructing a narrative.

Far left radicals will encourage the pursuit of poorly thought out
policy that causes the bottom to fall out and they will harness the
political momentum that results from economic chaos. They will
distract the masses from understanding the true causes of the economic
crisis, favoring to ideologically place the blame on capitalism. While
it may be a herculean task, I recommend scorching each neck of that
hydra with a blazing firebrand. The more radical leftists will not
hesitate to use each economic setback as a means to gain ground while
setting us back further. It will distract us from executing a coherent
strategy.

### Revolution is Expensive and the Opportunity Cost is Unacceptable

Groups planning to capitalizing on the economic chaos by rewriting the
narrative to undermine the American economic system are leading us
right off a cliff. Revolution involves transfer of power and of
assets, either legally, nomininally or just functionally. That's how
Marxist revolution works.

It's not a matter of opinion. There will be economic crisis and any
friction or discord in America's reaction is unacceptable. America
must unite and we cannot tolerate dissension or we will end up ceding
our own economic interests to our enemies at the culmination of human
history. America underneath the foot of our enemies will be
unrecognizable. You will not receive the social programs you are
looking for because our government, with a ruined currency, will not
be able to afford them. So, if you disrupt our fountain of prosperity
or our path forward, America will destroy you.

We completely anticipate a
[fifth column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column) to
emerge. If warranted, we will funnel antagonistic forces within
America into a single movement and we will break your back. At that
point, you might say that we are counting on it. The economic tensions
will need someone to blame and, with data science, we can determine
those advocating to undermine American interests. We will scapegoat
communists as an Ouroborosian alchemical cost to galvanize America, in
the name of safeguarding our interests.

As we approach the Singularity and phase out the workforce, Marxism's
semiotic basis of symbols related to work and pride in work begin to
break down. Your pattern language no longer functions for mind control
because the symbols upon which it is built become increasingly
irrelevant to human experience.

### [What Side Do You Want To Be On Anyways?](#what-side-do-you-want-to-be-on-anyways)

This is a potentially currency-breaking economic crisis. China, Russia
and others already have plans in place to replace the American Dollar
as the world's reserve currency. It's called
[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS). If you believe that life
will proceed swimmingly after our economy and currency are broken, a
new world order of Chinese hegemony is established, and that none of
this will interfere with America's ability to implement expansive
social programs or protect foreign policy interests, then you might
have a severe head injury.
