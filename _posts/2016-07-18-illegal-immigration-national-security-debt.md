- synonyms for tension & ethnic tension

My passion for this issue stems from a concern for the struggle that
illegal immigrants face in this country along with foresight on how
this problem grows over time. *It's National Security Debt.*

Illegal immigration is a serious long-term issue. Not to be alarmist,
but it's a bit of a powder keg. The further we let it go on, the worse
it gets. Regardless of who's side you're on, you need to hear me out.
The truth is, there aren't "sides" on this issue; it is painful for
everyone involved!

First of all, if you strongly disagree with this article, then I want
you to reach out to me. But I also want you to read Sun Tzu's Art of
War. It's free. It's short. Read one with some commentary or
something. You can probably read it in an hour or two. Read that and
then tell me about how I'm wrong.

### Illegal Immigration Hurts, Whether You Are:

#### &#x2605; From A Family with Four Hundred Year Old Roots in America

#### &#x2605; The Child of Immigrant Parents Who Struggled to Get Here

#### &#x2605; Part of a Family Who Illegally Crossed into America Chasing Opportunity

In 5,000 words or less -- HA! Like that was ever going to happen...

In 8,000 words or so, I'm going to provide you with the realest
summary of why it's a painful issue for everyone involved. You'll be
able to empathize with what illegal immigrants are going through in
this country. I'm going to try to describe what that's like, but I
don't actually know any illegal immigrants, so you'll have to forgive
me for that. And as much as you can try to put yourself in someone
else's shoes, you'll never truly know how that feels until you're
there.

#### Illegal Immigration Indicates a Failure of Border Security

Furthermore, I'll elaborate on how illegal immigration contributes to
other problems the country is facing. It's an indication of a failure
of border security. I'll discuss the challenges facing a resolution of
illegal immigration. These include challenges that are cultural,
financial, strategic or political. For example, publicly announcing
the policy details will change behavior. If we say "Free amnesty!
Citizenship for anyone for three months," what do you think that will
do? People might rush the border.

#### We can't solve this problem until we prevent people from entering the country illegally

Amnesty doesn't exactly solve the problem, by the way. People can
still come here illegally, so what does that do anyways? The debate on
this issue is ridiculous. This is why we need a wall. I hate the
!@#$ing wall, but we need it. The wall is mostly a symbol, by the
way. I don't care what the !@#$ it is, so long as it means that the
number of people crossing the border slows to a trickle.

<a name="illegal-immigration-is-painful-for-everyone" />

# [Illegal Immigration is Painful for Everyone](#illegal-immigration-is-painful-for-everyone)

Illegal immigration is an issue where everyone is affected, regardless
of how it personally affects you. It's an issue where everyone should
want to pursue policy changes for their own benefit. Instead, the
debate in this country frames the discussion in terms of race and
ethnicity. This is counterproductive because there are domestic
policy changes would would be beneficial for everyone, even the people
here illegally! And my motivation for writing this is partly derived
from my concern for the problems they face.

In an oversimplification, I'm going to divide families and people
living in America into four classes of citizenship. There are those
who have been citizens since the Baby Boomer generation or
before. Next, there are American families who have been citizens since
or after Generation X. These are more recent immigrants. Third, there
are immigrants working or studying in the country on a visa. I would
include those staying on an expired visa in this class. Finally, there
are illegal immigrants, who entered the country illegally.

Again, an oversimplification, but our domestic policies towards
illegal immigration affect each set differently.

Why draw this distinction between families who have been here since
the sixties and those who are more recent immigrants? Aren't we all
equally US Citizens? In the eyes of the law, yes. For all intensive
purposes, yes. I'm not arguing some people are more American and
others are less American. However, this issue is nuanced in regard to
various demographics.

<a name="citizens-since-or-before-the-baby-boomer-generation" />

## [Citizens Since or Before the Baby Boomer Generation](#citizens-since-or-before-the-baby-boomer-generation)

These are families that have been in America for around three or more
generations. These families have deeper roots and are well connected
in their local communities. This means they have well-established
support networks to lean on when things go wrong. They probably have a
few dozen family members they could rely on possibly in their own
city. There is no language barrier.

This group of people essentially wants the same things as others, but
in a different way, as they've benefitted from our society and its
systems for generations. Obviously some people in society face more
challenges than others and have differing viewpoints as to how and why
those problems exist. But, if they believe in the American Dream, then
they want to offer others the chance to partake in the system they see
as beneficial.

However, they still want strong immigration policy. They don't want
that system to be threatened by massive numbers of undocumented
immigrants bypassing those immigration procedures. if members of this
group of people understood the true long-term threat this posed, they
would be angry about it. Again, this issue is a problem precisely
because it's subtle and long-term.

<a name="citizens-since-or-after-generation-x" />

## [Citizens Since or After Generation X](#citizens-since-or-after-generation-x)

Families and people who have became citizens in the past generation or
two are going to feel differently on this issue. I think we also need
to recognize that almost every family in America is a family of
immigrants, in one way or another. For some who are more recent, they
might not have such extensive roots. When things go wrong, it might be
harder for them to reach out. Language can sometimes present a barrier
for first generation citizens, but that's eased over time. Still, it
can present challenges, making it harder to reach out. Or they can
become isolated.

Also, these more recent immigrants are going to view this issue
differently. For people who saved and worked hard to get here and the
worked hard to settle here, having tons of people just walk in to
receive amnesty a few generations later might rub them the wrong
way. Also, fairly strict and equally enforced immigration policy means
that we know a bit about the people who are coming here and we're
making sure those who do can help us continue to make America greater.

Illegal immigration isn't going to be as emotionally relevant to
non-hispanic ethnicities. They're not going to identify as personally
to the issue. They just aren't. We have to take this into account in a
respectful, emotionally intelligent way. To stifle all discussion here
leads us to inaction and that makes the eventual resolution of the
problem more painful.

If hispanic residents are feeling the effects ethnic discrimination,
that's going to exacerbate tension hispanic communities with both
legal and illegal residents. When they are citizens and have been, how
do you think that's going to make these people feel? Remember, these
are people who worked hard to find a way to get here. they came to
america for a reason, even though it was tough. If effects from such
treatment are serious, that further isolates families who would
probably otherwise be very patriotic!

<a name="immigrants-on-visa" />

## [Immigrants on Visa](#immigrants-on-visa)

Aside from illegal immigrants, legal immigrants working or studying on
a visa might be the least integrated people. Further still, a resident
on visa who's not planning on staying might not be trying to establish
as many connections. This grouping of American residents should
include people who are here because they overstayed their visa or
whatever. I don't know why. Just because.

These immigrants help strengthen our economy and fill in gaps for
skills we lack. If you're willing to move across the world, you're
willing to work hard. Yes, even if you are an illegal immigrant. If
you decide there's somewhere with better opportunity and you pick
yourself and your family up and you move across the world, you are
willing to make sacrifices and you're willing to work hard.

And these immigrants help contribute to diverse culture. I've linked
several times to this article on
[diversity as a strength](/posts/2016-07-17-diversity-is-americas-strength.html#a-microcosm-for-diversity-in-the-world). I
also rediscovered this post titled
[The Unknown - Monumental Accidents](/posts/2016-05-14-facets-of-greatness-the-unknown-monumental-accidents.html)
I wrote in May and it's actually better. It's part of the
[Facets of Greatness](/posts/2016-05-12-facets-of-greatness-intro.html)
series, but also has a section on
[how diversity strengthens America](/posts/2016-05-14-facets-of-greatness-the-unknown-monumental-accidents.html#embracing-diversity).

The most important point to emphacize here is: these immigrants
respected the law and procedures when they applied for the opportunity
to come here. I don't think they are too happy about those who
didn't. They are not going to be very happy about discrimination and
tension stirred up as a result of illegal immigration. They might not
have the same opinion on the cause of that and there's never any
excuse for such discrimination, but that shit hurts and now these
legal immigrants are feeling it too!

#### I've Been There, Too ...  Well Kinda

I've been in similar positions, where I moved to a place specifically
because I didn't know anyone and I wanted a fresh start. I went
through some serious problems, partially because I'm a bit quite. It
was tough being alone and I know that there weren't many people who
wanted me to succeed.

There were other times when I was in a new place and I met some really
amazing people. and they knew I had just moved a dozen or more hours
away from home, where I didn't know anyone. And instead of waiting for
me to make the first move, they worked hard to make me feel
comfortable. They made sure I was included and wanted to get to know
me. I'll never forget what that feels like and I've been there several
times too. In fact, these people are everywhere, but there aren't
nearly enough of them.

#### Which Experience Would You Prefer? What Do You Value?

And so, which experience would you prefer? If we could make one or the
other experience happen more often in this country, which should it
be? Obviously, the kind of experience where we connect with other
people. Again and again, I stress that isolating people is bad. That's
a really, really bad thing. We need to encourage connection. We need
to fight terror with love. Those damned souls who lead terror
organizations know how to stir up people to fight with lies and
deception, especially those who wouldn't otherwise pick up guns if
they knew the whole story! So we should help people, but at the same
time, we don't want to just let such radicalizing forces into our own
country!

#### I'd Love to Live in Japan

And I can't imagine what it'd be like to move somewhere where I'm just
learning the language. I want to move to Japan sometime. That'd be
awesome and the language immersion would be great for me. I really
like the culture. And the *food*, 美味しい！ And the cosplayers'
scene! lulz

<a name="illegal-immigrants" />

## [Illegal Immigrants](#illegal-immigrants)

Illegal immigrants are perhaps the worst off in this whole
situation. Accuse me of racism if you want, but it's actually empathy
with this group of people that encourages me to seek resolution as
soon as possible. Because, no matter how you slice it, inaction on
this issue is going to cause worse problems for this group of
people. Regardless of how you feel on solutions to this issue,
resolving it as soon as possible is in their best interest.

#### No, That Issue Is Not to Be Used as a Political Tool

So ... yeh ... keep going with those accusations. Because they're not
true and I'm like rubber: it *will* end up sticking to you. Many of my
enemies know these accusations are not true, but if they can get it to
stick, it's *just so effective* at disempowering political
opposition. And that's what makes me so mad. That's a sensitive
issue. It's not to be used as a political tool. If you do, you are
*the worst* and, if you do portray someone in this light falsely for
political gain, you do not care about the issue. So just stop acting
like you care. It really makes me mad. 

If you read
[this article](/posts/2016-07-17-diversity-is-americas-strength.html#a-microcosm-for-diversity-in-the-world),
you'll understand, but I'm doing you a favor honestly. Because the
more I convince you to dig deeper with your delusional arguments, the
more the situation will eventually swing in my favor... People will
understand that I care. And they will come together. And we will
conquer this shit.

Again, these people are the worst off in this situation. The policies
at the state and federal level seek to punish employers for hiring
illegal immigrants. This makes sense, but it has the unintended
consequence of making things tough for people who just wanted a better
life. And, they were willing to risk themselves and their families to
seek out the American Dream! Again, I don't care who you are or how
you got here: if you relocated your family across the world because
you thought it'd lead to better lives, you're willing to work hard.

#### By Definition, They Are Criminals

I do kinda care how you got here because if you came here illegally,
you broke the law getting here and you are breaking the law by being
here. btw, illegal immigrants are criminals, by definition But this
statement doesn't actually make any judgements about their character.
By definition someone labelled as an "illegal immigrant" must have
committed the crime of entering the country illegally. That's it. Why
is that controversial? Please, accept reality here. This is serious
and we need to handle it. There are solutions, lets make them happen
so we can move on.

But it's tough out there for people who are here illegally, so I
empathize with your situation.  Most of these people are of good
character and only came here for one of the following reasons. They
were fleeing hard circumstances in latin america, south america or
elsewhere. Or they wanted to pursue the american dream for themselves
or their children. We spend so much effort and money exporting the
American Dream, but we're going to get mad when people want in on
that?

Unfortunately, the effects from illegal immigration affect people
differently along generational and ethnic lines. Hispanic families
who've been here since the sixties may feel much differently about
policies than those who immigrated here in the nineties. But both
families may feel the effects of misappropriated prejudice ... as if
prejudice could ever be properly appropriated.

As more people illegally cross into America, the effects of this issue
and those nuanced responses to it become more pronounced. It stirs up
tensions in America along ethnic boundaries, causing people who are
long-time US citizens to get hurt for no good reason at all. Our own
citizens are redirecting the tension on themselves, further straining
tensions along ethnic boundaries.

<a name="this-issue-makes-america-vulnerable" />

## [This Issue Makes America Vulnerable](#this-issue-makes-america-vulnerable)

A third party can approach this issue in an obtuse manner to
demoralize us, using it as rhetoric against America. When it's career
suicide to mistakenly state a single politically incorrect phrase, the
discussion stagnates on this issue and others. There's a good reason
for strong response to insensitive and politically incorrect
statements. But, in a democracy, silencing that discussion can enable
internal and external factions to stifle change. It prevents America
from responding to America's problems.

For illegal immigration, lack of dialogue here means failure to act on
an issue that should be simple to fix. Over the course of decades,
this leads to serious problems. In and of itself, the issue isn't that
big of a deal. Downstream, inaction with this specific issue
intensifies problems described later on. Those downstream problems are
issues that foreign powers can subtly use to further demoralize and
destabilize America by highlighting ethnic tensions.

<a name="why-is-it-challenging" />

# [Why is it Challenging?](#why-is-it-challenging)

Why is it such a hard problem to tackle? Honestly, America has way
bigger problems *at the moment*. Yet, the more time passes, the harder
this becomes to resolve. The solutions will be more expensive and
tensions will be higher, stagnating policy change.

<a name="the-debate-isnt-structured-properly" />

## [The Debate Isn't Structured Properly](#the-debate-isnt-structured-properly)

The illegal immigration debate in America is messy. The PC police
prevent people from making specific statements. Without those
statements you can't complete a coherent arguement to relay to the
public. Without the public being aware of how this problem impacts us
in 2025, if unmitigated, then we can't move forward on it in a
democracy.

For the most part, it's great that people are restrained from making
statements that could lead to ethnic tension. However, that's not the
case if blacklisting specific propositions of an argument restrains us
from implementing the right public policy. This is especially true
*when inaction otherwise leads to a drastically worse situation*.

<a name="the-pros-dont-outweigh-the-cons" />

## [The Pros Don't Outweigh the Cons](#the-pros-dont-outweigh-the-cons)

There just aren't enough perceived benefits to justify the cost in
political capital from either side. We were entirely focused on health
care from 2008 through 2014. Since Ferguson, everyone's been focused
on the BlackLivesMatter protests and mounting tensions between
countries. And 2016 has been completely defined news so tragically
shocking and weird that I question the nature of reality every single
day. I'm pretty smart. If I can't figure out what the fuck is going
on...

Basically, combined with ever-restrictive, silently pervasive filter
bubbles in social media, this atmosphere in the media furthers an
already languishing debate. On illegal immigration. On any issue. This
trend has fully materialized in the past few months. We'll never get
anywhere with this debate. People don't understand that the problem
gets worse as time goes on.

But yet, AFAIK, democrats want to trade respect for law and
immigration procedures for a dozen million new votes via amnesty,
without building a wall. How's that gonna work? Oh... more votes. I
get it.

However, if being "tolerant" means tiptoeing around immigration and if
it's racist to say that there are people in this country who came here
illegally, how the !@#$ are we going to resolve these problems? And if
you supposedly stand opposed to intolerance and racism, I hate to tell
you, but your inaction here is going to make those problems worse!

The lack of incentive to solve is precisely why illegal immigration is
so dangerous. It's subtle. It wasn't addressed in the late nineties
and it was basically a hot potato in the aughties.

<a name="lackluster-solutions)" />

## [Lackluster Solutions](#lackluster-solutions)

There aren't any great answers and no one wants to let us hurt
anyone's feelings. The southern border with mexico is huge. It's hard
to justify the expense of a wall, but for that we need to think
outside the box.

<a name="amnesty-is-difficult-to-structure-properly" />

## [Amnesty is Difficult to Structure Properly](#amnesty-is-difficult-to-structure-properly)

Amnesty's a legal nightmare and possibly a policy quagmire. Depending
on how something like that is implemented, it will be a bureaucratic
mess creating another government agency that persists for decades and
steadily grows.

> Have you ever seen a federal bureaucracy on a hunger strike? Neither
> have I! They just feed themselves. End of year budget's like a shell
> game to justify increases, year after year.

Further to the point, some amnesty implementations completely
disregard legitimate immigration procedures and respect for the
law. What signal does that send to the people who dreamed big and
worked hard to get here?

<a name="lack-of-standard-identification" />

## [Lack of Standard Identification](#lack-of-standard-identification)

This is a national security mess. How does one prove identity? How do
we know you are who you say you are. All that talk about Real ID and
then we just hand ID's out to anyone that walks in. Basically, you
just pick yours up at Kroger.

No Photo ID? No documents? How are you going to handle those
situations? I'm sure that someone has thought about this way more than
I have.

<a name="proclamation-of-amnesty" />

## [Proclamation of Amnesty is Essentially Advertisement for Citizenship](#proclamation-of-amnesty)

This is one of those apsects that makes this problem so difficult to
resolve. You can't announce amnesty or anything like it, until we've
fixed the root problem. Doing so would be irresponsible. There won't
be a massive rush for the border, but the numbers will increase,
especially depending on the particular details.

The proclamation of an amnesty program is tantamount to advertising
free citizenship for anyone who can make it in in time. And there is
no way to implement amnesty in enough time to avoid a massive influx
of illegal immigration. You can't just snap your fingers. That kind of
stuff takes time! Most of the progress could occur in about five
years, but there's no way we could complete something like this in ten
years. I don't think.

Some illegal immigrants are great people and I think we should figure
out a way to provide *some* means of getting citizenship. Somehow.
This is discussed more, later on.

<a name="massive-deportations" />

## [Massive Deportations](#massive-deportations)

Does anyone really want to talk about this? No. I don't. But
seriously, what are we going to do? Again, inaction makes the problem
worse. And the people in this country don't get that. They're so
afraid to hurt someone's feelings by saying the wrong thing that
they'd rather knowingly let the whole damn thing become a powder keg
by 2025.

And think about it, most of the policies that people have supported up
to now

- massive deportation may work, but is equally riddled with
  problems.
  - obviously, there is an risk for racism and painful
    discrimination. it would definitely.
  - we may be able to mitigate this risk with technology

<a name="future-consequences-of-inaction-and-poor-policy" />

## [Future Consequences of Inaction and Poor Policy!](#future-consequences-of-inaction-and-poor-policy)

With each year that passes, the consequences of inaction become
increasingly severe, including long-lasting cultural problems!

> **E.G.** You put up a forcefield and stop people from entering the
> country. You then grant everyone amnesty. Ok, problem solved, right?
> *WRONG!!* Now you have a dozen million people, potentially bitter,
> who lack the same level of education. They don't have resumes and
> they don't have very much money either.

So, have you actually thought out how these policies will play out?
OK, so then, aside from national security, what is the single, worst
aspect of illegal immigration? It is the cultural isolation. The de
facto consequences here might as well be segregation. And we
absolutely can not have a segment of our population, long deprived of
education and employment opportunities, who is isolated along mostly
ethnic boundaries!

<a name="long-term-ethnic-tension-is-social-agony" />

## [Long-term Ethnic Tension is Agony](#long-term-ethnic-tension-is-social-agony)

I cannot emphasize this enough. That kind of crap ferments
longstanding ethnic tension. The kind of problems that cannot simply
be resolved. And yet, our inaction is going to further contribute to
this? Tearing down the real segregation was bad enough. Five decades
later and we're still dealing with long-term cultural problems from
that. And ... we want another source of problems like that? Hell no!

<a name="simultaneous-tensions-between-multiple-ethnicities-is-a-disaster" />

## [Simultaneous Tensions Between Multiple Ethnicities is a Disaster](#simultaneous-tensions-between-multiple-ethnicities-is-a-disaster)

These past two years, the nation has been intensely focused on ethnic
tensions, originally stemming from the Ferguson protests. The
attention there was entirely warranted by the way, even though it's
getting way out of hand! I can't believe what happened in Dallas!

So there are major ethnic tensions in the African American community.
That's not what I'm writing about, but regardless of how you feel
about them, what happens when you add growing ethnic tension in the
Hispanic community stemming from illegal immigration? At the same
time?! That combination could fracture this country!

> We really have to stop and ask ourselves: what sacrifices are we
> going to make to ensure this country doesn't fall apart!

Again, you need to read my article
[Diversity is America's Strength](/posts/2016-07-17-diversity-is-americas-strength.html#a-microcosm-for-diversity-in-the-world).
I was dead serious when I said that "*America is a microcosm of the
world, with respect to ethnic issues and diversity!"* What happens
here is indicitive to how things will play out in the rest of the
world by 2050. If we can't make it work here, in America, with 300
million people and plenty of wealth, how can we expect to make peace
amoung nations work across the globe?

<a name="why-is-it-a-problem" />

# [Why Is It A Problem?](#why-is-it-a-problem)

So, why should you care about illegal immigration? Why is it a
problem? Why is it your problem?

It's an issue that's felt differently for different groups of people,
but if you care about problems stemming from ethnic tensions, then you
would want to resolve this earlier than later. That's because every
year there's a larger population of undocumented immigrants. And the
larger the disparity there is between legal and illegal populations,
the larger the ethnic tension there will be. There are eleven million
people in the United States illegally. That's about 3% of the US
population. If instead, there were 20 million people, then that
approaches 5% or 6%, if you measure against US population at that
time. So, we already have to deal with about 1 in 50 people. Think
about the situation and how it affects internal issues when we have to
worry about 1 in 20 people!

So again, **if you care about fallout from ethnic tension**, then
you'll want to do something about it *sooner* than *later*. I'm tired
of explaining myself on what should be a minor issue.

<a name="national-security" />

## [National Security](#national-security)

Far and beyond, the biggest problem here is national security. You
just can't. Not in the 21st century. Not in America. We have millions
of people crossing the border? And we're paying to deal with the
consequences of it? In political capital? In government resources? In
terms of the growing strife amoung our people? And we don't know who
these people are? That's just a giant red flag!

We're worried about Al Qaeda ... but eleven million people just walked
on in? Man, that's eleven million chances for some terrible
organization to have already snuck someone in. It wouldn't surprise me
if Homeland Security hasn't already identified dozens of people who
have done just that.

And then to lambast the Republican nominee for pointing this out
because he's worried that eleven million undocumented immigrants might
contain people who cause problems or are just flat out enemies of the
state? Yeh, there is a better way to word the things he said. It's
pretty terrible to make those statements, but my counterpoint is that
*you can't even make statements tangential to my point that eleven
million people could contain enemies of the state.*

Am I crazy here? I mean I don't want to open a pandora's box of racism
because it's horrible. But we can't even manage our own damn country
because we're worried about hurting people's feelings. My feeling are
going to get pretty hurt if ethnic tensions spread to combine with
others and cause our country to suffer serious consequences. And we
could have stopped it, but didn't because we might hurt someone's
feelings.

I'd like to distance myself from the way Donald Trump said what he
did, but it's important to note the none of the eleven million
individuals who illegally crossed the border came here because they
wanted to surprise hundreds of Americans with giftboxes, filled with
candy and a bottle of wine. They came here out of self-interest. So,
they're getting what they want, giving us a headache with all the
stifled discussion and then possibly contributing to a perfect storm
of ethnic conflict by 2030.

And we can't talk about it, but Democrats can *openly* talk about
*using* this population for *more votes*. What the fuck?! If you
really cared, you'd be talking more about the challenges this
population will face once they get their ID card and citizenship.
Gotta get their vote and public support first, eh?

Just so I got this right, let me recap. There's water in the cargo
hold, we can't talk about the leak and you'd like us to take on some
more water -- and possibly some suicide bombers -- just so you can get
a stronger grip on the ship's wheel? I don't think so. We're going to
solve the problem at it's root. We're going to do so responsibly. It's
going to happen, starting now because otherwise it's going get messier
and uglier and nobody wants that! And you're going to help or you're
going to GTFO.

Basically, it's a national security problem in many ways.

<a name="problems-related-to-illegal-immigration"

# [Problems Related to Illegal Immigration](#problems-related-to-illegal-immigration)

<a name="lost-jobs" />

## [Lost Jobs](#lost-jobs)

Let me just get this out of the way because I'm going to torch this
straw man. The jobs that are being taken are really the least of our
concerns. If our concern is lost jobs, we should be more concerned
about those sent overseas.

Yes, it may disproportionately affect some industries. It's partially
because these industries are vulnerable to it in that the structure of
their finances lends itself to easily dispensing cash illegally.

... And they say I'm a business failure. Ha!

<a name="unpaid-income-tax" />

## [Unpaid Income Tax](#unpaid-income-taxes)

Illegal immigrants don't pay income taxes. They don't make very much
money, especially since state and federal laws are cracking down
against businesses who are caught hiring them.

Their labor isn't quantified by businesses in the same way as other
contractors or employees would be. This encourages sketchy book
keeping practices to hide payments. That's just bad business. Any
accounting system which needs to account for swapping money between
accounts and withdrawing cash for payment becomes necessarily more
complex, which makes it easier to cover other illegal behavior.

And I believe cooking the books is a separate crime itself. Now you
have two criminals: the illegal immigrant and the person who hired
them.

<a name="lack-of-employment-rights" />

## [Lack of Employment Rights](#lack-of-employement-rights)

Illegal immigrants don't have employment rights. This can lead to
tension. They can't expect contracts to be enforced and I imagine moot
contracts leads to unclear statements of work and/or service level
agreements. The lack of clearly stated requirements for work leads to
disputes where, basically, they have to do what someone says or they
don't get paid.

There's no authority in their employment environment that they can
rely on to provide fair arbitration in case of a dispute. They can't\
receive worker's comp or protection from OSHA. Any injury on the job
could result in major legal consequences for both the person and their
employer. After an accident requiring hospitalization, employee health
and safety should be the number one priority. Instead, both parties
here have an incentive to handle the situation to protect their own
interests. I imagine that leading to seriously fucked up situations
where someone is injured and loses future income, while simultaneously
dealing with an angry employer and potential legal consequences.

These and other situations lead to increased tension, risk and abuse
in illegal employment agreements, where they have no options for
recompense. Ask any union member whether they'd work without oversight
from OSHA or Worker's Comp. What would they say if you told them you
heard of a guy who got fired for breaking his arm, who never got paid
and received delayed medical care.

If you're on the left and it doesn't concern you that, in our
ambivalence, we have created a situation where there are *people* out
there who are not covered by protection of rights as an employee, *you
should be livid!*

<a name="cultural-isolation" />

## [Cultural Isolation](#cultural-isolation)

Let me start out by saying that the situation as it is now is moving
towards one frighteningly similar to *segregation under Jim Crow
laws!* Again, there are people out there who should be livid. We
understand the damage done by cultural isolation, right? Good. Let's
fix this shit and bring people together. Otherwise, our inaction
implies that we are implicit in creating a situation that may lead to
long-term issues along ethnic lines.

Since they can't get into trouble that results in legal action, these
people will become culturally isolated from the rest of America. They
would almost have to live in the shadows. They couldn't easily apply
for a bank account. They would use mostly cash, which can be
risky. They could receive payments through someone else, which would
make payments a bit simpler and easier to mask for businesses...

I've never actually met someone I know to be an illegal immigrant. And
I think that's a bad sign because three percent of our population --
11 million residents -- *is illegal*. That means, if I was in New
York, DC or Dallas, I should be able to walk around crowded city
blocks and three out of every one hundred people I see is living here
without a visa and without citizenship. I wouldn't try to point people
out, of course. And yet, I've never "met" someone who's here
illegally. Strange, n'est-ce pas? We all must walk by these people
every day, but I've never met one. Either I'm missing something or
this cultural isolation is really bad.

> Hey, how 'bout them Yankees? Nice weather, right? By the way, do you
> got a green card, esse?

Legitimacy of residency -- that's not something I'd imagine
someone would tell you right off the bat. So I hope this doesn't sound
insensitive.

<a name="policies-as-response-encourage-more-isolation" />

## [Policies as Response Encourage More Isolation](#policies-as-response-encourage-more-isolation)

The domestic policies meant to stem the demand for cheap labor from
illegal immigrants end up creating more problems. It's not because the
policies are flawed. These are just common sense policies: business
can't hire employees that aren't paid minimum wage, aren't guaranteed
employment rights and are here illegally.

These policies tough on both employee and employer. This compels
businesses to turn over their books when under suspicion.

These actually stoke the flames because now you have a slice of the
population who is essentially backed into a corner and is being
starved out. These policies are necessary, but risk serious
consequences of backlash from legal and illegal immigrants of various
ethnicities.

<a name="unintended-free-market-response-to-policy-response" />

## [Unintended Free Market Response to Policy Response](#unintended-free-market-response-to-policy-response)

Illegal immigrants seeking a living wage and trying to feed their
families are committing crimes by working. Employers hiring illegal
immigrants are committing several crimes by employing them, including
cooking their books. There are no social programs in place for this
major chunk of our population. No safety net. There is no social
security in place, in the truest sense of the term.

Eleven million. That's 3% of our population with no options for
stability and nowhere to go, when things get tough. Further, people
who knowingly support illegal immigrants without reporting them could
be committing a crime if they did so. I'd feel horrible if I was
compelled to rat someone out like that and ended up splitting up a
family.

What do people do, who hit hard times? They usually try to make ends
meet. Sometimes, this means they turn to crime or drugs to make money
... by the way, how many politicians out there would openly state
their views on anything? I mean *that's* politics. And so, yeh, I'm
saying that when things get tough, these policies could cause illegal
immigrants to resort to crime, like any other person whose family is
hungry. This is an example of a statement that can't be used as
component of an argument.

No, instead a politician would decide it's not worth mentioning
something offensive. Especially in a case like this, where not drawing
attention to it shields the public from thinking about it and, in the
end, provides reasons to arrest illegal immigrants who resort to crime
to feed themselves when they can't find work. Why would you risk the
offensive statement here?

Just think about that for a minute.

<a name="disparity-in-education-and-government-services" />

## [Disparity in Education and Government Services](#disparity-in-education-and-government-services)

Their children may or may not have access to education, depending on
circumstance. This could contribute to idle, under-educated
youth. What does that contribute to?

When we do solve this issue, these children will suffer lasting
consequences, as they won't easily conform to others of the same age
in the education system.

*Disparity in education is a major source of long-term
consequences*. A certain fraction of new citizens who, if granted
amnesty, *may* feel ashamed to admit to receiving amnesty, for fear of
judgement and for fear of being labeled as someone who is less
capable in the workplace. This could result from a lack of education
or a perceived lack of education, **both of which result from a
complete failure to provide an adequate amnesty process.**

A process which transitions illegal immigrants to citizens which does
not help bridge that gap is a failure out of the gate. You might as
well retire that horse. You might celebrate your victory on illegal
immigration and pat yourself on the back ... but guess what? You just
created a source of long-term tension along ethnic lines. That's like
sellin someone a car without an engine. Thanks a lot.

<a name="identification-and-proof-of-citizenship" />

## [Identification and Proof of Citizenship](#identification-and-proof-of-citizenship)

There's no assurance that these immigrants have valid identification,
contributing to national security and operational problems. I don't
want to elaborate too much here, but we're asking for it. There is
major potential for abuse of ICE procedures here. If we do need to
deport someone, where do we send them? It's possible to manipulate the
system into basically getting a free plane ticket anywhere they want.

<a name="#burden-of-cost-is-on-taxpayers" />

## [Burden of Cost is On Taxpayers](#burden-of-cost-is-on-taxpayers)

The burden of cost to monitor and deport is placed on taxpayers, but
we can't be sure that there's a coherent strategy for actual
resolution. This results in the formation of a bureaucracy, whose
budget from year-to-year actually requires maintainence of the problem
... to some extent, anyways. And because ICE needs congressional and
executive oversight, it also requires establishing reports
demonstrating reasonable progress.

It's necessary to provide visibility here and reports summarize ICE's
operations. However, the incentives for each party here do not line up
properly. There's major overhang with regard to enforcing immigration,
as in incentives driving each party's behavior line up like a wobbly
jenga tower. This is just the politics of business between a unit of
an organization that reports to a unit that reviews their actions, so
it's not entirely unexpected. Yet, I think we need to make sure that
we don't end up with these zombie bureaucracies that seek nominal
progress. We need policy and organizations that solve problems so we
can move on. When possible. That is not always possible.

<a name="fractured-families" />

## [Fractured Families](#fractured-families)

The current situation and the implementation of policy risks
fracturing families. This is agonizing and it's made worse to some
degree by inaction, when the discussion to construct a coherent policy
never really occured at all. Not to the necessary extent.

We have to be careful and tactful when developing and implementing
policy to address this because we absolutely do not want to cause this
pain. If it happens, we may have just caused excruciating pain that
will last for generations. And even if we disregard how it makes
others feel -- which is horrible -- then even still, every single time
it happens, it may create problems we have to deal with for
generations.

Some of the other policies in this country are fracturing families by
the way, which makes me !@#$'ing livid. I don't want to look under the
rug right now. That's generally valuable advice by the way: do not,
under any circumstance, look under that !@#$'ing rug. Everyone's got
one and it's there for a reason. You can walk on it. You can set your
table on it and that works pretty good. I wouldn't recommend moving
it. But under no circumstance should you ever attempt to look under
it.

<a name="cant-announce-policy-changes" />

## [Can't Announce Policy Changes](#cant-announce-policy-changes)

- and if amnesty is announced, we can be sure that these
      people will try to slip in.
  - this means we stymie an already stifled discussion
    - we can't really make suggestions without causing possibly
      significant changes in behavior

      viable strategy requires secrecy, but what
          i'm saying if no one knows the goals we are pushing towards
          with resolving illegal immigration, how can they know how to
          react?


- whenever we do decide on something, we have to be careful as to how
  we present it and announce it.

<a name="stifled-policy-debate" />

## [Stifled Policy Debate](#stifled-policy-debate)

- furthermore, we can't really have an open debate here.
  - partly because we can't talk about all the options on the table
    because of effect that could have on behavior
  - partly because of the PC Police scaring us into inaction by
    raising the spectre of racism

<a name="goals-for-an-ideal-policy" />

# [Goals For an Ideal Policy](#goals-for-an-ideal-policy)

## Stop Illegal Immigration

First of all, the number one priority is to make it harder for people
to cross the border. If we can't stop that, then there's not much else
that matters.

## Mitigate Long-Term Social and Cultural Problems

Second goal is to mitigate the accumulation of long-term social and
cultural problems. By cultural problems, I mean we have to guard
against promoting isolation of a community

Social problems include situations where citizens receive amnesty, but
are shut out of services afterwards. Or where citizens aren't
adequately prepared for the workforce. It absolutely must account for
the disparity in education & employability. Mandatory. If we don't
help them, they would become dependent on welfare, so we're going to
pay for it one way or another. It would be wise to do it in a way that
gives us the benefit of having planned for it and offered it. Another
social problem is family. We don't want to mess with someone's family
because that's going to be a hardship they'll remember and tell their
kids.

## Robust and Well-Thought Out

There are eleven million undocumented immigrants in the country.
There are going to be problems with some cases, but we don't want to
create more problems, especially long-term problems. Policies and
procedures should favor the state, in general, and should be designed
to prevent circumvention of measures. If someone can't handle that,
then it sounds like they might have general problems dealing with
rules and laws.

Remember, these are people that came here illegally in the first
place. They shouldn't be here, but they are. We need to figure out who
is staying and who is leaving. Some of the people who came here could
have been approved for citizenship, but others may have been denied or
were denied.

Whatever our rules are, we want people who want to comply. We don't
want people who don't want to comply. Sorry. This is our country and
we don't actually have to do anything except put you on a 20 hour bus
ride to Tijuana.

## Equitable and Fair

It should be fair to everyone. For illegal immigrants. For legal
citizens and immigrants too. I'm sure there's some people in
Washington that could figure what fair means exactly, but this is also
a chance to show how America deals with these things.

Yeh, we've got first world problems. Illegal immigration is kind of a
first world problem. Some countries have to figure out how to keep
people in. But, we respect human rights and we can show that. Every
crisis is an opportunity.

## Efficient with Clear Long-Term Goals

Why should we spend so much money on residents who came here
illegally? That's pretty crazy. Whatever our policy ends up being --
and I have ideas to implement -- we need to make sure it doesn't drag
out like the War on Drugs or something. And, hell no, we cannot have a
War on Illegal Immigration. That's a PR nightmare.

Example goals: transitions ~20-50% of existing illegal immigrants to
citizenship over 5 years through a two-year program; deports 95% of
remaining illegal immigrants over 10 years who didn't transition to
full citizens.

## We Stick To It

We're going to pick a horse and we're going to stick to it. Flux in
policy here is very expensive, moreso than usual.

<a name="what-are-the-answers" />

# [What are the Answers?](#what-are-the-answers)

The answers to these problems are what is really important. If we
can't find that, then it doesn't matter how much we talk about
it.

Some of these won't appeal to conservatives because ... the government
needs to finance some of it. That's fuels part of their refusal to
accept amnesty. My response: examine the long-term consequences of
prolonging inaction or implementing ineffective policies. Those are
both going to be incredibly expensive. Somehow, somebody's gotta spend
some money. It's frustrating, I know, but if there's a better answer,
I'd love to hear it.

### Transitionary Program

We need a program to transition people to citizenship. I don't really
want to call it amnesty though. That makes them sound like political
prisoners or something. That's crazy.

If there is some transitionary amnesty program, it should be something
that is appealing for undocumented immigrants to apply for, yet
something that is also fair to those who are here legally. We need to
communicate the benefits clearly and it motivate them to work with
us. Right now, there's not much incentive for undocumented immigrants
to walk in an ICE office. Why not? What is going to make them do that?

There need to be multiple channels like this and each one should
include some educational component. Like a G.E.D. requirement or
something. Obviously, something like national guard service wouldn't
work for everyone ... And are these people we want to train and give
guns? But for some people, that might work well.

Whatever it is, it should be a little risky. Like "i dont know if i
can do that, but if i work hard, then maybe." It should be
challenging, like military service would be challenging. Because,
whatever the goals are for transitions to citizenship, we want to
identify the people who will help us make America great again. Put the
others on a bus to Tijuana. It should act as an implicit filter, so
that the people who have qualities that contribute to society stay,
but we really don't want to think about it that way.

<a name="the-wall" />

### The Wall

We need a wall to stop it from getting worse. I don't know if that
means we should have a literal wall because that might not be as
effective as it needs to be.

### Address Foreign ID Card Standards

We can stress the importance of being able to identify citizens to
pressure Latin America and other regions to adopt more stringent
identification requirements. In general, this should help fight
terrorism.

<a name="a-disorganized-approach-is-detrimental" />

## [A Disorganized Approach is Detrimental](#a-disorganized-approach-is-detrimental)
  - move this up?

    - increased tensions for illegal and legal immigrants here
    - any concerted strategy for solving the problem requires some
      element of secrecy to be effectively implemented to prevent any
      unintended response
      - this necessitates circumventing the democratic process in
        congress
        - if you can't openly discuss something or suggest tactics
          because of it, then it's hard to put it into action in a
          democratic system
      - lack of discussion means that if the strategy changes from
        year to year and term to term, no one is going to know
        - which basically means there can be no coordinated, coherent
          strategy.
        - if you can't coordinate how the strategy changes from term
          to term (because of the secrecy) then how can you ensure
          that certain long-term tactics are properly executed
          - and certain long-term objectives are met

### Economic Policy

not really sure this will be very effective.
  - the solution starts by addressing economic/political issues in
    neighboring states (mexico)
    - we need work with mexico to establish mutually beneficial
      policies which create opportunities there
      - Microsoft manufactured the original xbox in guadalajara, for
        example.
    - transporting products from mexico should be cheaper.  right now,
      the transportation channels available to push products out of
      mexico and into america are suboptimal, AFAIK. i don't actually
      have much knowledge on the specifics, but i'm making inferences
      from a few key pieces of info
      - from what i know, i'm tending towards thinking that mexico has
        an infrastructure problem that prevents product from being
        efficiently exported
        - but i haven't researched this at all
    - whatever policy we undertake here needs to factor in
      strengthening our relationship with mexico.
    - mexican authorities need to be involved in stemming the flow
      - we need to present them with a choice, essentially
        - positive reinforcement for demonstrated traction towards
          solving this problem.
          - our numbers get better stateside, we encourage policies
            which help the situation
          - examples include cooperation on shared infrastructure
            projects or encouragement of manufacturing opportunities
            - however, if it's hard enough to create jobs in america,
              what business do we have promising to create jobs
              elsewhere, that's dumb
        - ... i don't really want to say "negative reinforcement" here
          - but we need to find means of motivating action here




### Attention and Compromise from Both Parties

  - and finally, solving this problem requires attention and
    compromise from both parties
    - the longer we wait, the worse it gets and the more negativity
      it generates.
    - we need some form of amnesty, the implementation of such a
      policy has it's own problems (stated above)
      - mostly, it's difficult to determine what is fair and what is
        just,
        - when requirements and process for this must remain secret.
        - and the discussion of it
