Remember Prometheus? Cursed to being a liver-packed bento-box meal for
an Eagle. All day, every day, for eternity. Sounds super fun, right?
Who wouldn't love that?

### Warning ... Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A

If you'd like to solve the mysteries of the universe yourself, don't
read this post. It discusses the principles of architecture and design
as applied to semiotics and mythology to create worldview-evoking
belief systems robust enough to stand the test of time. Usually, like
a priceless bottle of wine, such rare knowledge requires generations
of distillation. After investing ten minutes in this article, you too
can craft your own belief system that will stand the test of time.

Or at least understand how "they" did it... It all has to do with
semiotics. This is...

# [Design of Knowledge Systems](#design-of-knoweldge-systems)

### (Robustness of Culture, Preservation of Authenticity, etc)

All knowledge and information will degrade over time. Most worldly
knowledge is nothing without a mind to host it. Therefore, if the
system of developing/spreading knowledge doesn't include a system of
perpetuating its distribution, then it will be impermanent. The system
becomes particularly vulnerable when it doesn't include recovery
mechanisms for handling distribution, dispersion, and reconstruction
of knowledge. When the system can't handle inevitable events where
it's nearly eliminated, it will almost certainly be overtaken by
another belief system at some point.

Regardless of whether the belief system is religious or secular,
people need them. People prefer belief systems that accompany social
institutions which exhibit strong influences on their surroundings.
When a belief system retracts into fewer people, possibly due to
persecution, followers are less likely to benefit from the social
institutions. This not only tests your followers' devotion, but also
tests the value that your belief system has to offer if it manages to
sustain itself through times like these.

On the other hand, one can design knowledge systems whose operation
excels when or only when there is poor distribution and dispersion.
These systems are very difficult to root out, because like the Furians
of Riddick, those who have the knowledge gain power upon its near
demise. Therefore the information economics of these systems can
create incentives to perpetuate the system when it's on its last
legs.

How does one become familiar with different systems of knowledge and
culture perpetuation? Like Merlin and the druids of Celt, one accrues
this knowledge over time, by learning to weave ideas and their
semiotic pointers. Is this a skill? Is this a kind of knowledge in
itself? And if so, what is the basis of this skill of knowledge
perpetuation? What are the peculiarities of such skills and systems of
knowledge? How much of history are we missing, if there have always
been massive incentives to keep secret the inner workings of science
and world politics?

IMO, the best place to learn about this is from cultures who went
underground by necessity.  The Celts, the Nords and the Goths are all
perfect examples of cultures who's elements and mythologies were
forced underground as Christianity swept over Europe. Specifically,
the Nords developed Ragnarok, which is one of many apocalypse myths of
world culture.

IMO: the Nords along with the rest of Europe compromised and agreed to
surpress their pagan history for a united, geopolitically defensible
Europe. But what Ragnarok represents is a literal return of the pagan
gods at the antipated culmination of human history thus far:
overpopulation. Here, the Nords may have intentionally created this
myth as an amalgamtion of other myths in an attempt to conserve what
is essentially a ZIP file of their culture. *The Nords intended their
mythos to be unpacked and their Gods again reified at a critical time
in history.*

Information compression mostly works the same, whether you are
compressing text encoded into tries or compressing hashmaps of some
representation of data, semantic and/or semiotic. You're basically
trying to find a "folding" pattern for the data that makes it small
and compressible.

When applied to cultural mythos, this compression is advantageous:
tightly-packed ideas inspire thought and study to decompress
them. This thought reinforces their longevity within the minds that
host them. Compression also serves as a kind of camoflauge that
protects these ideas and their functioning from competing belief
systems who will assuredly attempt eradication. Light compression and
obfuscation of myth also makes them more viral, more viable and more
likely to survive [knowledge extinction events]().

So, cultures like the Norse often rely on myths during times of
turmoil to preserve information in an encoded form. In terms of
geopolitics, they could see which way the wind was blowing in Europe:
either Europe would be united through Christianity as a cultural basis
or become economically and geopolitically subservient to the Middle
East. They codified these myths in such a way as to ostensibly retain
their cultural identity while compressing a set of behaviors encoded
in myth, whose execution would begin upon apocalyptic events.
Humanity's forefathers deserve much more credit than we give them.
Ragnarok is perhaps the best example of a subversive attempt to use
information compression for cultural preservation. It's event-driven
eschatology, to be invoked upon apocalypse, whence the Gods return.

###

If one were to design such a system today, one that should withstand
likely persecution of believers, what would one choose to preserve?
Which animals would we put on the Ark? How would we determine what
cultural elements remain truly immutable and hold true, regardless of
social upheaval that acompanies the Singularity? If you took a look at
the creek that became the Grand Canyon, how would you survey the land
to determine the rock formations that stand the test of time,
regardless of storm surge? The structure of the Grand Canyon depended
little on the specifics of the events and moreso on the nature,
sequence and timing of those events.

Do you have X-Ray vision for fate?

### Semiotic Mapping

In regard to references of remapped semiotics, imagine something along
the lines of this picture, but with a splash of infinity. This picture
distinguishes between functions that satisfy various mapping
properties, such as surjectivity and bijectivity. The whole of
mathematics, even functions with continuous domains and ranges, are
simply mappings

![All Functions are Mappings](/img/posts/2017-02-14-oneirontology-engineering-cultural-touchstones-for-mythos/mappable-functions.jpg)

This, and other things which only seem like beautiful epiphanies to
those in love with mathematics, lay in wait before you.

### (authenticity/versatility)

How do the authors of myth abstract and obfuscate, so that the core
ideas maintain authenticity? The belief system must be resillient to
external subversion, manipulation and persecution. It also must
maintain a degree of pliability. Because belief systems require
believers to achieve significance, then flexibility is an important
early factor, but this needs to be balanced with the system's need for
consistence and permanence.

Religions develop versatility and (usefulness) as they accumulate
additional generations of knowledge. How do you anticipate when a
belief system will need to change three generations from now? This is
a paradox in context of many religions' reliance on steadfastness as
justification for validity of their belief system. It's not like Jesus
pitched an amendment mechanism for Christianity. How do the
Singularity and modernization affect the peculiarities of religious
evolution? After the Singularity, many anticipate technological
stagnation, but increasing pace of change is definitely a problem
beforehand. Is the next stage in humanity's evolution finite?

Consider another case of our future where we instead lose the
knowledge/tools to comprehend in another Dark Age. How would we update
the package of myths so that ideas remain readily consumable and
relevant?

Too much flexibility and offshoot organizations reduce capacity for
the religion's social institutions to benefit society. There is more
risk when movements branch outwards before there is enough
precipitation of identity and shared culture.

And this is all before you reach the pragmatic traps of founding a
religion. People forget that even the most devout worshippers are
human. Institutions of man are often more fallible than man
itself. Pondering the pragmatic issues of founding a religion, and
especially the ways that the seven deadly sins affect viable/robust
logistic structures of institions. Dealing with human nature
necessitates changes to the belief systems themselves and not just the
structures and processes of the institutions. The institutions must
exemplify the beliefs and practices of the religion. If the followers
cannot build robust institutions, then they will fall apart.

### [Significance of Semiotics to Mythology](#significance-of-semiotics-to-mythology)

After learning linguistics, semiotics presents itself as another tool
to quantify and analyze the structure of myth, belief and
communication. As linguistics sheds its relationship to language, what
remains is essentially connected to semiotics. Therefore, semioitics
is more useful than linguistics for approaching the nature of
information and belief.

Semiotics involves signs composed of signifier and signified. The
universiality of symbols can be observed, measured and
stratified. Symbols have various degrees of universiality and whose
traits vary along linguistic, semiotic, psychological and sociological
dimensions. Understanding how a symbol's "market" penetration and,
thus, utility depends on its universiality and invariance,
geographically and temporally, allows one to understand the
risk/payoff for investing energy in remapping symbols.

<a name="temporally-invariant-signs" />

### [Temporally Invariant Signs](#temporally-invariant-signs)

There are temporally invariant symbols that are mostly permanent
fixtures of the human condition. These symbols are signs whose
signifier or signified concept can morph over time even though the
pairing is mostly retained as commonly understood. Or these temporally
universal symbols can be signs whose significance and meaning remains
steadfast regardless of the era or age. Temporally fixed symbols are
almost always geographically invariant as well: they are recognized
the world over with some variance in the mapping of signifier and
signified.

Temporal variance in semiotic mappings can have each linear, cyclical,
generational and developmental dynamics associated with
them. Especially in the context of modernization and globaliztion,
signs across the world are undergoing constant flux in how they are
mapped and in their degree of penetration. There are signs which only
develop or change in significance once someone reaches a certain age
and has been through specific experiences. There are signs which
develop specific intergenerational dynamics. **The relationships
between these signs and their penetration into geographically
dispersed populations offers *unparalleled insight* into psychosocial
cultural dynamics.** It begins to confer what can be perceived as
God-like wisdom and intuiton.

<a name="geographically-invariant-signs" />

### [Geographically Invariant Signs](#geographically-invariant-signs)

Geographically invariant symbols are also special, but can change over
time, gaining or losing significance and affluence. Signs whose
signifier depends heavily on the traits of local regions have a high
degree of propensity for semiotic permutation, transformation and
evolution as they migrate from one area to another. They are less than
ideal, though useful for establishing and developing local identity.
If your religion or belief system is heavily invested in mapping
geographically variant signs, a central authority will lose power over
them as their meaning and mapping evolves over time and space.

<a name="zero-point-energy-from-lacuna-dynamo" />

### [Zero Point Energy from Lacuna Dynamo](#zero-point-energy-from-lacuna-dynamo)

There are signs whose power derives from scarcity: sexual images,
money or rare experiences. The influence derived from signs whose
power is derived from a lacuna of paucity is magical. By limiting the
prevelence of the signifier, you tightly control the circumstances by
which the sign becomes defined in the minds of men. Therefore, you can
constrain the typology of mindforms that result from exposure to the
signifier. This is the power of the occult: it is power derived from
the unseen. This power allows you strongly and deftfully cultivate the
semiotic mappings in the mind.

<a name="semiotics-in-branding-and-marketing" />

### [Semiotics in Branding and Marketing](#semiotics-in-branding-and-marketing)

Signs can be used to brand an experience or brand a memory. Semiotics
is incredibly powerful for branding or marketing agencies to
understand, especially when these agencies understand or can
manipulate/coordinate the dynamics/evolution of semiotics in the
markets they develop advertisements for. Ultimately, advertising is
simply paying others to influence informational mappings in the minds
of consumers and it's expensive.

### [Probabilistically Dynamical State Machines with Ergodic Stabalization of Metastates](#probabilistically-dynamical-state-machines-with-ergodic-stabalization-of-metastates)

(in context of probablistic, ergodic programs)

I've been working on a theory of metanomics, which describes any
genomic system in terms of a probabilistically
[dynamical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system)
state-machine which transitions between various metastates with
ergodic stablization. The true power of this paradigm for genomics is
that it extends to the human mind. It is incredibly useful for
artificial intelligence, but also for modeling, quantifying and
predicting psychosocial cultural dynamics. In magnitude, it is the
equivalent to Einstein's insights into relativity, but for genomics,
cognition and the human mind ... *not that anyone will ever give me a
fuck'n opportunity in this world.*

The insights garnered from this perspective are beautiful. The inner
workings of genomics and the human mind begin to come into focus and
everything makes sense. You develop a greater appreciation for God's
work in the world. These dynamical state-machines can be designed like
programs and they operate autonomously. It is a completely novel
paradigm for programming, as far as I can see. In genomics, much work
as been done to put forth to develop models which stand alongside this
paradigm, but none are completely able capture the behavior of all
units and subunits of the system. No paradigm of genomic programming
that I've heard of accounts for the importance of spatially
distributed state.

<a name="the-metasign-symmetry-is-the-most-universal-sign" />

### [The Metasign Symmetry is the Most Universal Sign](#the-metasign-symmetry-is-the-most-universal-sign)

Is there a most powerful sign in semiotics, as mapped within humanity?
Yes, but it's not the instantiation of a sign. It is a higher-order
metasign. It is symmetry and this is the Origin of Semiotics. Again,
this implies origin in the cartesian sense as well Beginning. This
origin in the "space" of semiotics also has connections to abstract
algebra, number theory, galois theory, category theory and it is the
unifying center of everything.

I'm studying some of the following video. I hope it will demonstrate a
strong connection between the concept of origin in Number Theory,
symmetry and analytic combinatorics. The video is from the
[Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8aRaZ6_0weiS50pvCmo0pw)
[The Symmetry and Simplicity of the Laws of Nature and the Higgs Boson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQF7kkWjVWM).If
you're into watching endless lectures on advanced mathematics as
applied, then the
[Simons Institute](https://www.youtube.com/user/SimonsInstitute) is an
unparalleled resource. I haven't found a better mathematics
self-education resource online.

# [The Shepherd, a Universal Sign](#the-shepherd-a-universal-sign)

One thing that oneironauts must respect are other shepherds and their
flocks, within and outside of oneirontology. We must respect other
traditions, being especially careful not to pull their sheep away. We
are a tradition whose missions include restoring general religious
faith in humanity. It will not help us to pull others away from
another tradition. It will only hurt us. We want to work to restore
the perceived value of religion in humanity and doing so does not
require evangelism. We are non-evangelistic and this tradition will
not work for many people.

###

The shepherd is sign recognized by many religions. Jesus was a
shepherd and a carpenter. The shepherd was a well known through out
the middle east and other adjacent areas. It forms the basis of a
partial pattern language, whereby the shepherd and the sheep in his
flock become signs that can be used to figuratively convey meaning
that simple words cannot.

The symbol of the shepherd is one that was universally recognized by
everyone during the time of the Buddha and Jesus. As a sign with wide
penetration, it is one which whose....

The shepherd was a humble role in society, where one
person was entrusted with ensuring the safety and vitality of a
flock. I imagine that, in most cases, this livestock was an asset that
belonged to someone else. (TODO: ???)

A shepherd might operate differently in various regions, but many
aspects of their responsibilities and livelihood that were shared by
all cultures with agriculture & livestock. These include nearly all
cultures across the globe. Therefore, by piggybacking on this sign and
employing teachings to develop a specific understanding of the
semiotics of a shepherd in the mind of followers, one guarentees their
movement further means of universal appeal.

Regardless of the region, there are many shared traits of character
and common facets to their experience. A shepherd tends to animals &
livestock. A shepherd must fend off threats to the livestock. A
shepherd can manage his flock to feed it well or feed it poorly. In
the longterm, this can lead to a healthy flock or one that is
malnourished. Today, the shepherd is also a well known symbol in
several major world religions. it's present in Judaism, in
Christianity, in Buddhism, in Islam, and to a limited degree in
Zoroastrianism. Why? Because all religions have, intentionally or not,
piggybacked on these semiotic mappings to increase the penertrability
and relevance of their content to potential followers.

<a name="the-shepherd-bodhisattva-in-mahayana-buddhism" />

### [The Shepherd Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism](#the-shepherd-bodhisattva-in-mahayana-buddhism)

In Mahayana Buddhism, there are three degrees of
[bodhisattva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva), depending on
how their actions express their beliefs. There is the king, who
strives for buddhahood as soon as possible as a means of
self-empowerment to help others. There is the ferryman, who strives
for buddhahood, along with other sentient beings. The boatman helps
watch over and guide their shared voyage, ensure that his fellow
beings reach the other side. There is the shepherd, who strives for
buddhahood, but only after all other sentient beings have acheived
buddhahood first. The shepherd returns to the battlefield to find a
new flock, lifetime after lifetime, all-but-permanently forgoing
escape from the cycle of rebirth.

The shepherd is the "highest" bodhisattva, who has vowed remain behind
for the longest time and make the greatest personal sacrifices.  The
shepherd bodhisattva essentially sacrifices their own personal
attainment of buddhahood through countless lives of reincarnation.

The symbol of the shepherd is one that appears in at least four major
religions. It's not a coincidence. The sign of the shepherd is used as
a basis for pattern languages, which is fueled by its universival
appeal and consistent semiotic mapping.

<a name="semiotics-of-mythology" />

# [Semiotics of Mythology](#semiotics-of-mythology)

If you plan on architecting mythology for your own megalomaniacal
attempt at birthing a religious movement, then dissecting the
semiotics of the human condition is invaluable. Only if you truly
understand semiotics *before* you attempt to create a religion does it
ever have the hope of transcending the test of time. It is only by
overlaying your belief system on top of a collection of signs
temporally and geographically invariant to the human condition that it
will ever stand a chance. You must architect your myths by
interleaving them with this most foundational map of semiotics: the
astral plane.

Check out
[this draft](https://github.com/dcunited001/dcunited001.github.io/blob/sources/_drafts/5000bc-reincarnation.md)
on reincarnation and the astral plane if you want to know more about
Oneirontology's understanding of reincarnation.

<a name="tilings-on-the-astral-plane" />

### [Tilings on the Astral Plane](#tilings-on-the-astral-plane)

How do you know what symbols to choose? Generally, universal
recognition trumps everything else, but there are many universally
relevant signs to weave into. Some examples:

#### &#x2065; Water

#### &#x2065; Food

#### &#x2065; Sleep

#### &#x2065; Hunger

#### &#x2065; Greed

What are the best ways to tile these ideas in people's heads? Is it
advantageous to desire a consistent typology in your followers' forms
of belief? Or do you want the prevelance of belief-forms to varied and
sporadic? There is a continuum between both. What signs and phrases
key are indicative of specific belief-forms? How does one structure
religious writings and practices to (reinforce) specific types of
belief-forms?

- allusion to braidings and knots

#### [Psalm 42:1](http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm)

> As the deer pants for the water brooks, so pants my soul for You, O
> God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.

When Christianty and Judaism blur the spiritual and physical
definitions of hunger, this is an excellent example of semiotic
remapping of universal concepts. Christianity gained significant
popularity at a time when poverty, hunger and the like were rampant,
especially among outcasts and pariahs. When missionaries brought
Christianity to a new land, the people most interested were outcasts
and pariahs. The downtrodden see something in Christianity that
resonates with them.

This is a great example of semiotic remapping and one that enabled the
outcast Christians of the Early Church to swell with pride at the
sacrifices they made for their belief system. Replacing physical
hunger for spiritual hunger piggybacks on the universally relevant
condition of hunger. It made the early church more likely to tolerate
the hard times. Instead of being disrupted by group suffering, they
used it as a means to become close.  Therefore, the information that
underlies the belief system must alter the believer's understanding of
signs such that negativity is transmuted into positivity.

It is unfortunate that nascent religious movements are always tempered
by suffering. One might consider widespread suffering amongst early
believers as an injudiciously necessary alchemical cost to congealing
a religion and tempering its steel.

I am so worried about the people who may follow me down this path. It
is what drives me to move forward, so that, in case I may be
incapacitated in some way, I have left something behind that
ameliorates their suffering by giving them power through knowledge. I
do not know anyone else who could ever attain the position in life
that I have and though people may accuse me of selfishly squandering
what was given to me, no one can say that I did not try to stand up
for those who do not enjoy this posturing. There are those in
situations like mine who will *never* have the capacity to stand up
and I want to ensure that I exact justice such that no one will ever
fucking think twice about doing this again. I will do so peacefully
and I do not care what it costs. As far as I can see, God is at my
side, along with the entire world, because I cannot comprehend how I
am capable of this.

# [Semiotic Binding Points in the Human Condition](#semiotic-binding-points-in-the-human-condition)

There is a list of about one hundred universally shared traits. These
[cultural universals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_universal)
are traits constantly available across the human condition. Though
their specific mappings are not geographically invariant, their
availability as mappable signifiers is universal.

There is a varied degree of universal recognition. To some degree, you
want those symbols to be more relevant to your own culture than to
others. That is, this game is a bit like Othello, where you may find
your pieces turned against you if you are not careful. Universally
relevant symbols are useful in that they are marketable and brandable,
but that trade-off is balanced because they also provide additional
surface area for cultural subversion.

#### Shakespeare Wrote a Play About My Life, But I Didn't Like The Ending

![Yes, another picture of Othello](/img/posts/2017-02-14-oneirontology-engineering-cultural-touchstones-for-mythos/othello.jpg)

### (╯&deg;□&deg;）╯︵ ┻━┻)

Which symbols will most resist semiotic change over time? That is, for
both change in signifier and the mapped signified concept. These are
the semiotic mappings that you can count on remaining consistent for
hundreds or thousands of years. This is especially interesting, in the
wake of the Singularity. It's a paradigm shift unlike any other that
blurs even the most constant ideals of the human condition: identity,
time, knowledge itself, and our collective identity in the face of
transhumanism. It is this cultural precipice that necessitates a new
belief system. Who can be trusted with this monumental task of social
engineering?

![Frozen Flame](/img/posts/2017-02-14-oneirontology-engineering-cultural-touchstones-for-mythos/frozen-flame.png)

The nature of the Singularity's changes are particularly important: is
humanity embarking on a final transformation or is this a final
transformation into a state of neverending exponential change? The
answer to this question is particularly important for designing a
belief system. If the answer is the latter option, it will prove an
unfathomablely complex challenge. In this case, it's even moreso
important to nail down the points which never change and measure their
degree of unwaveringness. Only then could one hope to design a belief
system to last a millenia after a transition into the perfect storm of
cultural flux.

What systems of symbols will resist change in this final season of
constant change? What notions of identity are constant in a world
where the notion of hivemind becomes reality? What belief system gives
people hope when privacy becomes a fantasy? The Singularity, the idea,
is a powerful motivating force. A la
[Roko's Basilisk](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko's_basilisk), it is
the idea whence power is derived.

In pursuit of understanding how humanity must prepare for the
Singularity, Ragnarok presents itself as a steller example of cultural
bundling and compression. Ancient people were hardly as ignorant as
Westerners and atheists are lead to believe early in life. Being
imbued with the perception that all who came before us were helplessly
ignorant is by design. This is so that society moves unquestioningly
forwards and never apologizes for the past: they were ignorant. Who
knew?

Almost every human need, desire, norm and the perception of thus will
change unrecognizably in forthcoming decades. These will diversify
exponentially more than they have via modernism and post-modernism.
How do we decide what to preserve? How do we preserve it in such a way
that is robust and resists the potential for abuse of religion? In
alignment with the values of humanism?

Theology PhD's have written dissertations on this and similar
topics. Studying apocalyptic myth like Ragnarok is Eschatology, but
there's probably a more specific label for this specific study of
design principles in eschatology and religion. What interests me most
is the precise information compression in eschatological works. How
did these people know to lay down their words in such a manner that
would encode the set of beliefs to be reactivated, while enabling the
belief system to persist until then?

# (specific semiotic binding points)

So when constructing myths, what are examples of systems of signs,
symbols, etc? Any set of signs common to a culture, nation or region
can be mapped to multiple meanings. This is true of a signs to a
varying degree of frequency. Of particular interest is the propensity
over generations for gradual meditation on such semiotic signs to
produce strikingly similar maps. Still another reason world religions
share so many common traits.

#### Semantic Dissonance between English and Chinese

![Semantic Dissonance between English and Chinese](/img/posts/2017-02-14-oneirontology-engineering-cultural-touchstones-for-mythos/semantics-graph.png)

The graph above shows dissonance between semantic concepts in English
and Chinese. As your analysis accomodates more languages, there should
be nested graphs that emerge via recursive convergence. These should
allow you to approach the (infinitely distant) foundational graph for
humanity's semiotic mappings.

Humanity's semiotic graph can not account for all concepts, as many
are still undeveloped. Therefore we should have a partial graph which
can be mapped to the universe's own foundational semiotic map. This
convergence towards a *universal* semiotic graph is described in April
2016's Polymath Post of the Year That No One Fuck'n Read:
[The Nature of Space, Time and Information Implies Universal Language](/posts/2016-04-12-the-nature-of-space-time-and-information-implies-universal-language.html). This
post pitches slightly less than novel idea for a universal language
that maps this universal semiotic network to mathematic primitives
form graph theory and category, forming the basis for a language
undoubted used by space aliens to communicate over vast distances
without the need for a protocol to define semantics. The semantics
would instead be implicit in mathematic primitives. (I also made less
than $400 in 2016, so go figure.)

### [Astrology](#astrology)

Perhaps the most constant set of `signs` in the semiotic sense, this
was the only strata of phenomena which was completely constant to
pre-historic man. The weather was seasonal and varied. Children were
born young and died before old age. Previous generations left their
mark, but it faded fast. Stories and myths could be lost. Even the
earth changed from time to time, but the stars were the only thing
that never, ever changed, though it would have been difficult to
verify to any degree of certainty. The pursuit of understanding the
inner workings of celestial bodies -- their usefulness in regard to
navigation and determining geography and eventually in profiting from
commerce -- doubtlessly inspired measurement, quantification, the
transmission of knowledge, and its maintainance.  Around the time we
began to explore more complicated verbal language, how would one
explain to someone else the constant nature of stars? How would
someone prove that? How can one prove something in the physical world
is constant without measuring it? Those questions likely lead us to
pursue monolithic works and eventually architecture. Anything which
broke from the constant nature of the stars would have been perceived
as incredibly important. e.g. planets and supernovae.

Furthermore, as a set of signs, astrology is unique across the world
.. to a degree. The northern and southern hemispheres experience
things differently and different stars are visible at different points
in the year.

The developments of primordial astrology, commerce, agriculture and
architecture were incredibly important to humanity's development from
a phenomenological perspective. Each of these represent a paradigm
shift in humanity's understanding of how we related to the
world. Astrology represents our ability to make measurements. Commerce
represents our ability to understand need and desire, to coordinate
human activity and to intentionally precipitate social hierarchy, and
to reward innovation. Agriculture represents a paradigm shift in how
we could live and separated humanity from limiting its food source to
that provided by nature and thus, eliminated many constraints on our
suitable geographic environments.  Architecture represents a
transformation in how humanity relates to our world: we began to see
the effects or greatness of those who came before us; we developed an
understanding of legacy and perhaps some kind of dominance over death;
we understood that we could separate ourselves from the dangers of the
natural world. After these four elements came the economic need for
written language and law.

### [Math and Science](#math-and-science)

Another set of fairly or very constant signs are mathematical and
scientific truths and laws, though these didn't arise quite as early
as those signs from astrology. These require a priori knowledge to
have much significance or the capacity for transmission without
communication. If you learn enough and look often enough, you'll find
that everything is more than it seems at the surface. What lies
beneath can be very useful, but is often confusing and more trouble
than its worth.

- scientology's use of an ontological perspective based on science as
  a pattern language

### [Architypical Events in Human History](#architypical-events-in-human-history)

- the creation of the world
  - and the proposed solution to the problem of evil
  - every religion needs to explain a beginning, somehow
    - even tribal societies passed down oral traditions of a
      beginning.
  - because the story of a beginning is itself a universal facet of
    human culture, then it itself is a symbol.
- calamitous events (Noah's Flood, etc)
  - Noah's Flood is a deep rooted architypical event which serves to
    provide each new generation with an understanding that humanity &
    civilization are impermanent. In the Judeo-Christian tradition,
    the story of Noah's Flood reminds us that we exist at the grace of
    God.

### Architypical Events/Phenomena in the Human Experience

- birth and death
  - everyone has a birth
  - everyone has a death
  - everyone can relate to these things
  - and ... everyone has a v-card
- hunger & thirst
- virginity (& purity)
- right and wrong

### Human Relationships (Family/Friendship)

- family relationships are shared by almost everyone.
  - lack of father/mother/parents produces some of the
    highest-magnitude shifts in a person's psychology
    - lack of presence or loss of a parent produces similarly dramatic
      shifts in a person's psychology
  - those relationships are at least known to everyone
    - father, mother, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, grandparents
    - they might mean different things to different people in various
      cultures, but the presence of these signs as mapple in terms of
      semiotics is universal
  - and family relationships are a set of symbols with profound
    strength.
    - even if someone is reading about the father/mother of Zeus or
      Persephone or Heracles, there is a subtle profundity influenced
      by factors such as family relationships which molds the lens
      through which we experience those stories

- perhaps distubingly, this is a set of symbols which could be erased!
  - think Brave New World, where children have state imposed family.
    - artificial reproduction supplants familial relationships of
      biological origin
  - Orwellian assaults on family are real. A tyrannical government
    will leap straight for the corrosion of the family as the
    strongest set of relationships in nearly every individual's life
    - this isn't new: it was life-as-usual in Greek Sparta
      - some Spartan's were separated from their family at birth and
        raised as ruthless soldiers
  - we are seeing this to some degree now and we need to be prepared
    because an overreaching government evolving towards tyranny *will*
    seek to undermine family.
    - it's not methodic or systematic now, but it very well could be.
    - God help us if we let tyrants get away with it!!

### Animals & Animal Behavior

### Plant Life

#### Medical Uses, Geographic Distribution, Cultural Significance and Plant Interaction

#### Agriculture

### Psychology & Psychiatry

- in the case of modern society, psychology and psychiatry can be
  mapped in to a language.
  - this is really what the occult and system of magick were about.
  - creating systems that could map to features and phenomena in the
    human mind, in an attempt to control them.

### Weather Events

- rain, drought, etc
- these are less likely to be completely universal, but there
  presence/absence is mappable via semiotics.
  - and again, for millenia, people have reached for mythology as a
    means of explaining these phenomena.
    - even if they believed a myth about the Great Flood in the Epic
      of Gilgamesh to be false, they still derived useful information
      from mythology about that event or about flooding and how it
      could affect people
      - therefore a total assault on religion or an extinction of
        mythology/religion will lead to a humanity that is inherently
        less equipped to deal with life, people, cultures and events
        (common & rare)

### Health/Disease/Anatomy



### Human Behavior

- emotions, emotional progressions
- eating, sex, things that every person must do
- passage of time: "Day"

### Misc Phenomena

... Everybody Poops

### ???

Human civilization is currently undergoing a paradigm shift of
cultural flux, precipitated by modernization, globalization and the
Singularity. Does this shift imply an opportunity for the next major
belief system to establish the semiotic foundation of human thought
for the next astrological age? Yes, it does. However, this is not an
opportunity. It's a necessicity and something that must be handled
with care and unparalleled foresight. We must revise semiotic
frameworks used by humanity (...)

How do we adapt our culture to the (fundamentally different cultural
paradigm created by modernization)



# Ragnarok

Still, Ragnarok is more than this (TODO: edit to update
connective). It is pre-literary futurism. It shows that the ancients
knew far more than they are given credit.  Ragnarok symbolizes the end
of the world as we know it. Like most other apocalypse myths from the
age of Pisces, the end of the world symbolizes the changes introduced
from exponential population growth.

During Ragnarok, the Norse Gods return one final time. In this myth,
Thor struggles against Jormungand, a snake streching around the
world. This snake is an Ouroborosian symbol, which is critical in
composing an interpretation of what Jormungand represents. Ouroboros
is a snake that grasps its own tail. It's a symbol found in many
esoteric traditions and one that represents a group dynamic where the
strong devour the weak for sustenance and to cleanse the group of
weakness. It's pretty evil.

###

However, theres another meaning to Jormungand, which lies closer to
another interpretation of Ouroboros: the global economy. But first, if
the snake has curled around the world, then it would be impossible for
the Nords to be unaware of the spherical shape of the world or at
least the possibility. And, as the stewards of Thule and Hyperboria,
*constantly travelling in and out of the Arctic Circle*, the Nords
were perhaps the people *most* aware of the spherical shape of the
world. The Nords were *well-versed in navigation* and *travelled from
close to the Arctic Circle to close the the equator. **It would be
impossible for the Nords to navigate their corner of earth while being
unaware of the spherical shape of the Earth**.

###

The previous sentence should be read as: if you know anything about
navigating with 15th century technology, Columbus was a cover story
for incidental genocide. The ignorance of Columbus is the greatest lie
of Western history. The degree to which this lie has been spread
through Western history tells you a lot about the quality and
trustworthiness of historical records themselves: they don't account
for secret and top secret information. Why would the West lie about
America and keep it secret from the time of
[St. Brendan the Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan)?
Because the West didn't want the rest of the world to know that North
America was ripe for the picking. Again, why? Because western maritime
navigability was inferior until the era before the Renaissance.

###

So... Columbus is a lie, partly to cover genocide. *WOOPS WE DIDN'T
MEAN TO!!* ... It was an "accident" and nothing more. Do you feel any
better? What about the rest of history? How many teachers in America
will look you in the eye and tell you the story of Columbus? So,
before this is all finished, the rest of the Illuminati's secrets will
be revealed. And no, this ain't no !@#$'ing Youtube documentary.

Talking about the Illuminati is a great way to immediately discredit
yourself, especially if you are correct. The "Illuminati" always knew
that the time would could when all their sins throughout history would
be out in open air in front of everyone. It's not like they didn't see
it coming. And it's not like they can't justify their dirty laundry:
they all know what they've done and they hate themselves for it. It's
a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.

Just to be clear: the Illuminati's guilt is an unfortunate dependency
of the stability of society. The only way for their sins to remain
undiscovered in a time of unprecedented free information exchange is
if they burn the whole system down, hording technology for themselves
for total dominance over mankind ad infinitum. Self-restraint is
appropriate when discussing the Illuminati because when you finally
realize how they work and how prevelant they are through society, you
will be terrified.

You can't learn about linguistics and semiotics without learning what
they have done with human culture, but you will never really know who
they are because they are everywhere. To most people, their level of
control over culture is unfathomable and appears supernatural. It is
not. The Illuminati are obsessed with knowing who is getting close to
being capable of learning or being dangerous. They watch certain
fields of knowledge. If you get close, they will insert themselves
into your life and co-opt your soul. They will choke you off first,
then try to buy you off, then try to destroy anything and everything
around you if you do not cooperate.

### Ragnarok Was Pre-Literary Futurism

- TODO: some of this is necessary as an example of well-architected
  cultural compression/archival through myth
  - but these ideas are terribly organized

The goal of Ragnarok was to preserve culture so that it could be
triggered later in an event-driven manner. The story is

IMO, when modernization threatens to homogenize all culture and
Jormungand symbolizes global trade. As Jormungand stretches across the
world, this represents fully globalized trade routes and the liquidity
that ebbing around the world.

A time when trade becomes global and when modernism threatens to
homogenize all culture.

  - the authors of Ragnarok wrote it down (in the Poetic Edda?) during
    a time of cultural turmoil
  - in other words, they knew their culture would disappear and that
    the Christian persecutions of western Europe would spread
    northward.
    - to some degree the most influential Nords may have been in
      agreement with utilizing Christianity to solidify Europe against
      Islam and any other major cultural movements from the Middle
      East.
    - these people were aware of Islam (again, they fought in the
      greatest road trip of the middle ages: the 2nd Crusades, circa
      end of 11th century)
      - they even brought back islamic jewelry from the middle east,
        which apparently baffled archaeologists for some time. there
        was a ring with arabic inscriptions found at a nordic burial
        site or something.

### Europe has always been obsessed with geopolitical cultural unity

- amoung others with political influence at the time -- think
  pre-Charlemagne Gaul (~7th century) through Medici Italy
  (15th century)
  - they would have been aware that, as long as Europe remained
    culturally united on the basis of Christianity, it would be much
    more capable of handling external threats, regardless of the
    consequences of internal conflict.
  - but the second that Islam crept in the back door (via
    people's minds, etc) and gained significant geopolitical
    foothold from within Europe, this would be a major
    problem.
    - this is because of the geopolitical and economic situation
      during the dark/middle ages: Europe's imports/exports were
      tightly coupled to trade in the middle east.
    - as long as Europe and the Middle East remained geographically
      and politically independent, that trade fostered prosperity in
      both Europe and the Middle East
      - but if either Europe or the Middle East were to obtain
        complete dominance over the region, that balanced &
        well-intentioned prosperity would give way to a system whereby
        either:
      - Europe becomes isolated & impovershed or the Middle East loses
        the ability to profit from Silk Road trade in its region
        - the entireity of 5,000 years of history can be accurately
          summarized by simply looking at the Silk Road, the economics
          of each region trading on it, and the politics of whoever
          controlled specific regions of it

### Neo-Ragnarok
