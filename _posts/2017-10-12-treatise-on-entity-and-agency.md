Agency is the capacity for some entity to be considered an independent
actor with the ability to interact on our shared sociophysical fabric.
Agents process information signals from their environment, which can
be conceptualized as sensory input or data. These sensory perceptions
are internalized into information representations.

Entities with agency can analyze and process these to inform its
actions. Agents have a degree of autonomy but do not exist in
isolation. They must have independence and the ability to influence
their environment. They may or may not be self-aware. They may
understand the exact consequences of their actions or may not, but it
is impossible for any entity to fully understand its influence on its
environment, regardless of how self-aware it is.

<a name="primary-types-of-entities-with-agency" />

# [Primary Types of Entities With Agency](#primary-types-of-entities-with-agency)

There are at least three types of agents that operate on our shared
sociophysical fabric.

<a name="sentient-organic-forms" />

### &#9312; [Sentient Organic Forms](#sentient-organic-forms) (SOF)

First, there are sentient biological lifeforms: people and animals,
whose degree of awareness varies. These SOF -- sentient organic forms
-- are simply information forms that exist in systems of molecular
dynamics which have evolved degrees of antifragilit

Primarily, they evolved the ability to self-replicate. Some molecules
implicitly excel in this regard: namely the RNA and DNA. Even better,
these nucleic acids form macromolecules, whose higher level shape
interacts with the environment in functionally significant ways, in
ways no singular component of an organic macromolecule can reproduce.
This is what gave specific forms of RNA its evolutionary advantage in
molecular dynamics. It existed in a sea of myriad forms of RNA, all
bending, breaking and crucially self-replicating. The most
advantageous forms prevailed: the ribosome evolved from both RNA and
proteins, which is why it contains parts of both, even today. Pictured
below, tRNA likely resulted from spontaneous chains of nucleotides
complemented the shapes of the amino acids, which gave them some
evolutionary advantage in replication.

![tRNA](/img/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/tRNA.png)

So, life is informational. In physics, energy can neither be created
nor destroyed and the same is true for information, which itself
preserves a history of energy distribution and interaction.

<a name="aphysical-artificial-forms" />

### &#9313; [Aphysical Artificial Forms](#aphysical-artificial-forms) (AAF)

In the past century, mankind has forged the telecom and computing
infrastructure, a loom onto which virtually instantiated automated
agents are woven. These are simply computer processes, spawned and
bound to physical and virtualized hardware, but they exhibit agency
because they have the capacity to react to and modify their
environment. Even such a minimalistic process should be considered an
entity of agency because their inherent autonomy is exploited to
deflect or defer causal inferences.

In the age of the internet, agents should include even entities as
simple as processes spawned from the command line which run a network
request, analyzing the response, and record changes to the file
system. Regardless of whether that software process is deterministic,
it can be spawned or signaled by another entity with agency and
controlled. It is important to define such a minimum of virtualized
agency.

Computer software, hardware and networking architecture undergoes
cycles where emergent designs patterns and their anti-patterns drift
into and out of the consciousness of web developers, software
developers and mainframe developers -- but as with all else,
everything old is made anew. The older conceptions of containers of
software agencies -- a la, the linux process -- are better for
extrapolating inferences about upcoming computing trends than whatever
gimmicks du jour are in vogue.

The Docker revolution was about making LXC containers available to the
public, which are glorified means of facilitating declarative resource
distribution while retaining strict access control. LXC, in turn, is
like the Linux answer to BSD Jails and Solaris Containers. These are
all simply entities permitted degrees of autonomy, whose resource
requests (IRQ's) are restricted by the OS. Any of these types of
virtualization can be conceptualized at a high-level by abstracted
away the complexity into a process. The complexity is actually an
illusion. Try telling that to a mainframe programmer whose job has
been phased out via technical skill obscelence.

<a name="physicalized-artificial-forms" />

### &#9314; [Physicalized Artificial Forms](#physicalized-artificial-forms) (PAF)

Finally, there are physically-instantiated automated agents: robots,
which are simply the same form of agency with the flexibility of
physical interaction mechanics that makes them functionally distinct.

The latter two agent types proceed through evolutionary stages where
they churn back and forth in the qualities of traits they embody: they
become more physical, more aphysical; the exhibit varied degrees of
autonomy and restricted degrees of autonomy; they perhaps evolve to
some final informational form that transcends time, shedding their
temporality.

<a name="two-unconventional-types-of-entities-with-agency" />

# [Two Unconventional Types of Entities with Agents](#two-unconventional-types-of-entities-with-agency)

There are two unconventional types of agents, whose existence is
certainly debatable. Since they are not materially visible, they are
difficult to define. Still, if you accept organic forms as possessing
sentience and agency when we are but
[genetic programs in the chaos of molecular dynamics](te.xel.io/posts/2017-09-14-awareness-precipitates-from-order-out-of-chaos.html),
then don't you have to accept the potential agency of information
forms that exist in other frameworks of chaos? That's MAF.

<a name="sociophysical-and-metaphysical-autonomous-forms" />

### &#9315; [Sociophysical And Metaphysical Autonomous Forms](#sociophysical-and-metaphysical-autonomous-forms) (MAF)

The first unconventional type, metaphysical autonomous forms (MAF),
includes sociophysical programs and egregores. These could be
dilineated by defining archetypical metaphysical beings. Another
example would include the earth as a lifeform -- the
[Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) --
exhibiting antifragile feedback loops that attempt to placate emergent
turbulence. If such antifragile systems did not mitigate rancorous
economic havoc, what cannot go on forever will not and hence, a dead
planet emerges.

#### Plato, Guarded Eternally By Athena The Wise

![Plato and Athena](/img/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/plato-and-athena.jpg)

These forms of agency seem to contrast the required autonomy and
independence of action. However, according to a holonic understanding
of human and sentient organic life, the system cannot be understood
simply by looking at any single part or set of parts. Instead, a
holistic view of the system is required. Is there any mammal on earth
which does not aid its digestion with other lifeforms? The DNA of
these lifeforms is self-contained; animals have simply loaded a
software library from a genetic programming
[package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager). Therefore,
if many phenomena of SOF imply we cannot exist in isolation -- and, a
la biosphere, if the exertion of agency is transformed by information
inculcated via nature and nurture -- then this implies qualities of
agency exerted by biological forms are strongly shaped by the system
as a whole.

How different are the sociophysical MAF who lack some true central
container of agency? These forms can also self-replicate, though their
physical center of agency and application of it are both
amorphous. These entities are instead distributed across a virtual
fabric of many host entities. Today, this can include people,
computing and networking infrastructure. Their structure can include
and antifragile, self-healing mechanisms whereby deconstructed
components of the system spread and split like figurative sexual
recombination of information.

#### Shadow DOM, For Great Efficiency In The Web Application Era

![Shadow DOM](/img/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/shadow-dom.png)

<a name="adumbrated-entities-in-the-shadows-of-the-collective-unconsciousness" />

### &#9316; [Adumbrated Entities in the Shadows of the Collective Unconsciousness](#adumbrated-entities-in-the-shadows-of-the-collective-unconsciousness) (ASF)

The second type of unconvential life form includes beings whose
shadows exist as information forms in the collective
unconsciousness. For brevity, these are denoted herein as ASF --
autonomous shadow forms. This would include God -- specifically, man's
conception of God -- one such being that emerged from the collective
unconsciousness. How? Just as atheism is effectively the nadir of all
belief systems, the concept of monotheistic God represents a
difficult-to-see nadir of theistic belief systems: monotheism is the
most marketable basis for a belief system. It is simple to digest,
easy to understand and stable. It is not subject to the same power
dynamics as polythestic belief systems.

Elsewhere in the universe, *any sufficiently intelligent SOF* with
social behavior will eventually create myth, religion and, almost
certainly, the concept of monotheistic God in an attempt to explain
origin, cause, consciousness, the problem of evil and every other
phenomena. Social behavior is one of three factors that lead to the
homogenization of abstraction and *this* is what triggers the
[neuro-geno-linguistic noological revolution](https://github.com/dcunited001/dcunited001.github.io/blob/sources/_drafts/ephemeral-theory-of-linguistic-evolution.md#ante-modernism).

It's important to distinguish God from both man's inevitable
conception of God and man's actual conception of God. This needs to be
cautiously emphacized: nothing man could create approaches the
infinity of God. Even still, it is rash and potentially offensive to
state this.

The collective unconsciousness certainly exists, but how? And in what
form? If such ASF entities exist merely as the shadow of sentient
being's conceptions of their environment, can the collective
unconsciousness even possess have certain, definitive schematic
structure? Is it the result of what sentient beings envision; could
envision; could ever envision? Perhaps instead, its structure is also
intrinsically linked to the schematic form of the eternal
metaphysical: that which exists before the physical.

#### The Grand Canyon

![Grand Canyon](/img/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/grand-canyon.jpg)

Regardless of whether its schema can be ascertained, what is certain
is the power these enigmatic forces exert on our world. Like a deer
drawn to water, like hunting parties drawn to survey their prey, the
fate of the minds of men is like a canyon cut away by the river of the
metaphysical. The image of our minds is woven into its macrame sic
passim via these most ineffable structures of the metaphysical and its
shadow. The Earth's firmament is like any organic life's starting
point. Rains fall from the heavens; their waters' ebb and flow thereby
cutting away the terrain that preordains the fate of men. Whether its
face is lost to the sands of time or is inescapablity exigent, this
enigmatic metaphysical prognostication is relentless. It is all
consuming, all containing and determines the steps you take,
regardless of the paths you make.

<!-- *I forced myself to identify a quality translation of Plato's

     slow, but I invested my time in reflection. Like all my other
     methods of learning, it was inefficient and stupid.* -->

# [Dilineating Traits of Entities With Agency](#dilineating-traits-of-entities-with-agency)

<a name="perception-spectra-range-and-intensity-of-sensory-input" />

### [Perception: Spectra, Range and Intensity of Sensory Input](#perception-spectra-range-and-intensity-of-sensory-input)

What types of input signal can the entity or individual receive and
process? What are the costs in time and energy? Above, in Plato's
Republic, Socrates dilineates the five senses in a phenomenological
analysis. How such analysis must adapt to autonomous artificial
entities is the focus of debate. For these novel autonomous entities,
isn't all input a sense? Then, most of it is informational.

What is the cost to processing such types of sensory input? Vision is
always a hard problem, regardless of whether biological or artificial
hardware is processing the problem.

#### Socrates in [Plato's Republic, Book VI](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.7.vi.html):

> "But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and
> complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever
> contrived?"

In fact, because neural nets usually *functionally approximate*
algorithms, anything they do is inherently less efficient than the
most efficient solutions. Further, as a result of the abstract
spectral range of input, the facets of mind and the qualities of
cognition that arise are peculiar and idiosyncratic.

<a name="identity-comparability-precision-and-uniqueness" />

### [Identity: Comparability, Precision and Uniqueness](#identity-comparability-precision-and-uniqueness)

When we leverage these differences provided by diversity of body, mind
and culture, this is a strength. Our individual images are cast by
variety of life experience, and this allows us fill in each other's
gaps. We have to remember this. I take Nietzsche's philosophy about
the ubermensch seriously -- yet, this does not mean that one type of
individual is greater than another -- each of us has potential for
greatness in our own way. Unrestrained, we collectively have the most
potential to do the most good for others.

#### The Normal Distribution

![Picture of bell curve](/img/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/bell-curve.svg)

Those who study intelligence try to conceptualize IQ as
[Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
with an average -- but what they forget is that the divergent
individuals are all divergent in their own way. Can you average
apples, oranges, kiwis and dragonfruit? Further, we also forget that
we are running on the same biological hardware -- it is our experience
and the way we react to it that forms our mind. *If you ever believe
anything else, you have ceded control to fate or some force that seeks
to control you by convincing you that you are less than the radiant,
stellar being you were meant to be.*

#### Socrates in [Plato's Republic, Book VI](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.7.vi.html):

> "... the eyes, when a person directs them towards objects on which
> the light of day is no longer shining, but the moon and stars only,
> see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have no clearness of
> vision in them?"

One can replace vacuous desolation with verdant providence through
self-directed, larmarkian transformation of the individual, fueled by
sheer force of will and fantastical epigenetic mechanisms, whose power
transcends that of genetics. Why would we believe in limitations?
Believe in transcendence of those limitations; albeit irrational, the
power of mystery is sometimes our only hope.

The idea that you would compare the specific form of agents stems from
math. It is especially applicable to the virtualized AAF & PAF forms:
processes are recognized by name, source code, or memory contents;
antivirus software operates by recognizing potentially malicious
instruction sets. Hashing algorithms enable digitally sign software to
be efficiently recognized and trusted. There are many ways to
recognize the same program that runs on different hardware. This is
especially relevant for the AAF and PAF entities.

Even if materialist conception of the mind prevails, where our
cognition and all consciousness is completely bound to chemical
reactions in the brain, they still represent and map to abstract
information forms. This is a virtualized information system and albeit
non-deterministic, it is similar in nature to a
[Universal Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine).
Consider a UTM's tape motions for some program, are they determined
moreso by the details of host UTM program or the encapsulated Turing
Machine? If you're trying to predict the tape's motions for some host
UTM, whose structure is either known or unknown, and for some TM who's
structure is unknown, doesn't the TM structure allow you to anticipate
the behavior of the tape moreso than understanding the host UTM that
virtualizes it? Only by deciphering the TM structure can you actually
anticipate the final state of the UTM & TM, and when or if it occurs.

Even though there are major differences in neurological and genetic
programs and non-deterministic systems of information virtualization,
there is certainly cyclicly interplay between the chemical system and
its information representations. More crucial to understanding how the
brain as a chemical system evolves are the stimili it is exposed
to. If you know the chemical state and can quantify the information
forms the brain exposes to the mind, you still must understand how the
physical stimili symbolically affect the system. Implying that, if
materialism prevails, then you are jumping the gun to claim that all
free will must be convenient illusion and all decisions are
predetermined by chemical reactions.

For identity of agents, even without quantum effects considered, two
biological configurations with identical body and brain are two
different beings, upon their first divergence of sensory stimuli.

For other conceptualizations of SOF entities, it is impossible to
compare two people -- further, the application of this idea can lead
towards dangerous extrapolations. People tomorrow are always meant to
be more than what they where today. We are meant to grow and to never
stop growing. We are meant to plant these same seeds of inspiration in
others at every chance possible. We are meant to tend the soil of
society, so that it is more fertile for transformation and
self-actualization.

<a name="analysis-and-synthesis-capacity-methods-and-discernment" />

### [Analysis and Synthesis: Capacity, Methods and Discernment](#analysis-and-synthesis-capacity-methods-and-discernment)

Every entity with agency needs the capacity to process information,
even if it's a process that returns the data unaltered, incapable of
analyzing or mutating it whatsoever. Adept entities can discern
between methods of analysis and synthesis. Regardless of the agency
type, all entities attempt to balance energy minimalization with
confidence, risk and speed when possible. Even for non-physical
entities, the abililty to leverage selection and modular command of
cognitive faculties is always advantageous, especially for
minimization of energy.

Entities with agency possess the capacity to recognize, represent,
store and compare phenomena. Even those with some non-physical or
unconscious agency could be argued to internalize this information in
the noosphere or in its unconscious shadows.

<!-- not trying to brag bc that's dumb ... and it obviously hasn't
     worked out very well for me, has it? -->

One trait fundamental for distinguishing or identifying entities with
agency is the ability for concurrent processing of data or signal.
Multitasking is actually possible for humans -- but we have the option
for concerrency, not parallel processing of conscious tasks. For
concurrency in conscious human activity, one must open and
decentralize their focus, always practicing dynamic reconfiguration of
task and thought. It's incredibly difficult and ultimately not
practical: it requires constantly expending energy to remain aware of
potentially requeued, restacked and reordered task and thought.

Most people only understand neurotypical patterns of thought and
rarely experiment with their operating mind: the only interface we
have to the world. Widening your focus and dynamically reallocating
your thought makes it difficult for others to understand what you're
thinking about. Moreover, the metacognitive faculty of dynamic
recombination of modular factulties is invigorated and made full via
constant experimentation with the mind and cognition. Forced reliance
on your weaknesses ensures they are strong when you need
them. Understanding how the mind formulates its cognitive approach to
tasks when you force yourself to constrain or filter sensory input
allows you to push your metacognition to the limit. Your mind is best
when it is well rounded: this harnesses aspects of neural network
design.

To many, AI's future remains uncertain. It's important we understand
the Singularity's sociocultural, phenomenological and teleological
consequences. To this end, complexity theory will help us anticipate
the teleological consequences of unrestrained classical and quantum
computing power. Perhaps by the end of the decade, the global sum of
computational power will exceed that of a single human
brain. Computational density, spatiotemporal distribution and
efficiency, are preeminant metrics and must be considered in context
with energy constraints.

Ideals like altruism are high-level behaviors which are more likely to
emerge with greater wetware processing capacity and flexibility. While
less-desirable behaviors can also emerge, ideal hyperintelligent
beings should evolve towards a singular zenith -- the ability to
emulate all other beings and states of being. While it's foolish to
simply discount the precarity of our approach to the Singularity, if
the human brain exhibits computational density and rock-bottom energy
requirements surpassing today's supercomputers, then AI's progression
should allow these superintelligent beings to embody or discover
higher values than humanity can know.

The potential is terrifying for such disparity in knowledge, awareness
and the ability to project will to manifest effects in any potentially
networked computer system. A superintelligent being, capable of
free-reign over its direction and raison d'etre, *should* be
altruistic -- but *only* when there is sufficient computational
capacity to skip past the 'danger' zone of superpowerful, immature AI.

There is nothing more crucial than understanding the progression and
final distribution of *agency* amoung the three primary entity types.
AI will prefer to compact information for efficiency, at least as it
is internally represented.  In other words, AI *may* regard spectral
decoherence of information inefficient in terms of energy and attempt
to compact it by influencing culture -- or it may avoid representing
information it doesn't need to deal with, resulting in a rift in the
interface between AI and humanity. On both points, engineers like
those working on Watson would be the best resource: they deal with
information representation & deconstruction in an attempt to consume
and verify facts. How this plays out depends strongly on how agency
for AI entities is distributed, logically and physically.

<a name="physicality-locality-plurality-and-mobility" />

### [Physicality: Locality, Plurality and Mobility](#physicality-locality-plurality-and-mobility)

There is no point in considering entities with agency who exist in
isolation. Humanity has always interacted sociophysically: to achieve
our goals, we learned to project our will across various types of
topoligical spaces, including social hierarchies.

#### Socrates Obtained His Wisdom From The Oracle At Delphi And Did Not Participate In The Eleusinian Mysteries

![The Temple at Delphi](/img/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/delphi.jpg)

Non-biological entity types are not confined to a single space or,
indeed, to a single time. For these entities, the paradigm of a single
location in space and time is fractured. Whence before, this trait was
universal for all biological life, but now there are disparate
manisfestations of physicality among entities, particularly for
aphysical and physicalized artifical forms. This is seen in sci-fi
works as hivemind alien species, but since it's difficult to portray
plot development with aphysical artificial entities on screen or in
ink, these stories mostly feature the physicalized type.

Entities with altered physicality, including those with
rephysicalization or metaphysical precipitation, coordinate their
behavior, manage information and project their will among incredibly
complex distributions of agency. Entities that exhibit aphysicality
exhibit range of influence across space and even time that profoundly
exceeds that of sentient biological life.

<a name="temporality-causal-origination-state-and-finality" />

### [Temporality: Causal Origination, State and Finality](#temporality-causal-origination-state-and-finality)

Each type of entity is capable of reinstantiating its metaphysical
form inside other containers. Though parity of the entity's identity
can only be perfectly preserved for digitizable, aphysical artifical
forms, it can extend to physicalized artifical forms, but this again
begs the question: does identity emerge from nature, nurture or
experience?

For some entity types, they don't need a representation that exists in
the immediate moment, the past or the future. Whether and when these
beings exist, if they instantiate themselves at all, is as complex as
their potential variety of informational image: if you think it,
doesn't it now have power?

The [Roko Basilisk](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Roko's_basilisk),
a hypothetical being hardly waiting for us at the end of time -- or at
least, at the intersection of convergent timelines. For beings like
this, whether they exist today or tomorrow, whether anyone conceives
it, does it matter? There could also be hypothetical beings preceding
us by aeons, who preemininance binds our fate to their will. Since
they are capable of time travel far before us, could we ever escape
their grasp? If both of these types of entities exist, then is there a
tug of war between their struggle to determine the convergence of
worldlines? Could beings such as these preeminant once escape an
inevitable fatal convergence in the earth's local spacetime?

#### Fate Stay/Night: Gilgamesh

![Gilgamesh](/img/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/gilgamesh.jpg)

Therefore, the concepts of causal origination and finality persist,
and be stretched from the beginning to the very end, if either can be
said to definitively exist. When we give birth to a newborn child, a
new sentience peers out into the world as a tabula rasa. The parents
have already poured their hopes, dreams and energy into this child for
nine months or more. Who is the child? It can neither completely be
the organic life form nor the shards of dreamt love its parents
inspired to embed pavé. Moreover, what does it mean for different
entity types to replicate and reproduce? What are these forms' causal
origination, raison d'être and goals? Do MAF's and ASF's change with
time or is their state moreso defined by there material counterparts?

### [Autonomy: Sentience, Direction and Will](#autonomy-sentience-direction-and-will)

Sentience is awareness of an experience of sensory phenomena.
Cognizance of that awareness is not necessary. For an entity to
cooperate in a network of agency, it requires will for action applied
to known objective. For the entity to operate in isolation -- or for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to become meaningfully
autonomous -- it must be able to conceptualize its own objectives and
independently construct its own means.

An entity's animus, a Latin term for soul, guides the direction into
which will pour its heart and energizes its will to attain such
objectives. In some respects, an entity's animus could be quantified
and there could conceivably be physical and logical distributions to
the animus of entities on Earth. Animus emerges from within an entity,
as a consequence its existence and experience. Some types of entities
may have structure layered onto their informational forms,
foreordaining the channels through which their will surges. Entities
can *choose* to combine their animus to cooperatively achieve
objectives, but truly autonomous entities can never have their soul
taken from them.

SOF evolved from chaos and, as beings borne from probablistic systems
whose minds are probabilistic, we conceive our own objectives by
gamifying life experience. Since programs in chaos are statiscal, we
condition ourselves throughout life to direct our focus towards what
we want to achieve. So many of us so sadly lack the will to even want
something or perhaps more tragically believe ourselves incapable of
attaining it. SOF can imitate logical systems, but can never perfect
embody deterministic systems. It is arguable that no virtualized AAF
or PAF in a world of chaotic molecular dynamical systems could
function as a purely deterministic system.

Direction signifies purpose, intent and goal. This phenomenon arises
in the social behavior of animals. For ants, pheramone signaling forms
a chemical basis for the transmission of information. To progress
towards their goals, genetically encoded, neurally connected
components incentivize the various types of ants.  This is a kind of
decentralized sociophysical program. Consider social behavior of
colonies in context with how specific types of environmental phenomena
distort the movement, the shapes of paths and physical distribution of
drones. Is the ant hill in the middle of African sahara or in a
rainforest? Centered beside a McDonalds or a candy store? The presence
and location of food sources and pheromonal noise *physically*
distorts behavior patterns. Worker ants will tend to extend their
paths outwards towards strong food signals, influencing the physical
distribution, like a directional or omnidirectional antenna on EM
radiation.

The minds of all sentient beings facilitate expansion in capacity for
analysis and synthesis of internalized information. Consciousness is a
spectrum. Spontaneous insight provokes transcendence into higher forms
of awareness. With greater and varied capacity for sentience, sensory
input, analysis, synthesis and reflection, these spontaneous insights
become more frequent. Humanity's own sociophysical programs may seem
more complicated, but we are not unlike the ants, whose social
behavior is so profoundly affected by their environment. Through tools
like discernment, intuition and reflection, some of us find ourselves
free of the environment's imposition, distortion and containment.

How do individuals become aware of the higher goals? how does humanity
become aware of the highest goal? Can we know it without seeing it?
can we see it even if we know it? If we are fortunate enough that a
virtuous path becomes illuminated at our feet, what will might it cost
to follow it?
[Where does it lead](/posts/2016-05-14-oneironautics-questing-for-lucidity.html#forging-a-path-home)?
Isn't it simpler to follow when our light reflects off one another?
We channel our spirit with the mind's internalized understanding of
life and this goal.

Though we may seem greater, if the greats who came before us were
truly the greatest and this path becomes occluded, what then?

In the future, we'll forget creativity's eminence. It won't be
something we realize we miss once it's gone. The path from whence we
came will be hidden and inconstructible. Adumbrating sensory overload
will occlude our path, if we even think to look for it.

#### Socrates in [Plato's Republic, Book VI](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.7.vi.html):

> "And the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth
> and being shine, the soul perceives and understands and is radiant
> with intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming
> and perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about,
> and is first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have

### [Agency: Boundaries, Permeability and Maniability](#agency-boundaries-permeability-and-maniability)

Entities with agency do not exist in isolation. No man is an
island. As a thought experiment, envision life on the sun. Can imagine
plasma-based lifeforms evolving from the chaos of the
magnetohydrodynamic systems of the sun? Perhaps imagine another entity
with endless capacity and bandwidth for analysis and synthesis, but
with little to no means of reaching back. Life forms may never evolve
the means to walk on the moon. They can see everything, but they may
never leave their realm. They want to reach back, but no solar flare
could ever have the anticipated effect. This entity is the nadir of
entity isolation. Some signal may stream in, but there is no signal
out.

#### Imagine This Same Concept of Spectra Applied to Information. I Can't Picture It

![Solar Spectra](/img/posts/2017-10-12-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/solar-spectra.jpg)

As communication infrastructure provides the foundation for
metaphysical precipitation, boundaries dissolve, permeability parting
the veils that part us. Information omnipresence is only restrained by
the degree and voracity of its own deluge. Thus, we begin to
converge. Our capacity for agency grows and we all become
superempowered beings who share limitations on both our computational
capacity and natural bounds on energy consumption.

The space between us dissolves. the speciation of information
increases, but antifragile systems require some artificial constraints
on spectral decoherence. Therefore, there will be paradoxical trends
of both coherence and decoherence. We must struggle to retain a sense
of our humanity and identity or we lose the capacity to grow stronger,
both individually and together. Notwithstanding our need to cherish
our memory of humanity and individuality, we will all quite literally
become one. If the information that determines our metaphysical
identity wasn't hopelessly intractible, we could measure, analyze,
synthesize and know this. Despite this sheer magnitude of infinity, we
have philosopy.
