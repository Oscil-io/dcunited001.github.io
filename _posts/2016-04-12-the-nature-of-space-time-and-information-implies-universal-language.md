Knowledge and information are woven onto a universal loom, transcending
time and space.  Knowledge travels faster than light, without traveling at all.
What is the foundation of the structure of this metaphysical space, this universal
loom that enables us to weave higher order concepts into language and ideas.  Does this
foundation form the basis for a kind of universal language?  Is there some most
universal language which every sufficiently advanced culture is fated to develop?
Can such a language be used to transcend the temporal limitations imposed by space?

That is, each sufficiently adv. race would invariably produce the same communication forms
and protocols.  If this is possible and if the conditions of transcending Fermi's Paradox
promote or require its development, then each culture in the galaxy or universe capable
of serious interstellar participation would develop this.  At least, until that culture
developed technology which transcended the limits of the speed of light.  There may be
a period of 10,000 to millions of years before a civilization truly transcends space and
it may not work out to be as convenient as warp drive. The means of surpassing the speed
of light and imposition of the vastness of space may be incredibly expensive in terms
of energy, which begets galactic ethics issues.  Who's energy is that to harvest anyway?

Since the timescale of communication relay is so large -- upwards of 200,000 years, round
trip to ping the farthest reachs of the Milky Way from Earth! -- something of a universal
language may be incredibly important.  What would the basis of such a language be? Math!
The language would be based on mathematic, algebraic & combinatorial primitives from 
category theory, algebraic geometry, etc., combined in some "universal" way to produce 
grammer and encoded semantics.

Furthermore, the exact time in which a species in the galaxy is obtaining tech for 
outer space exploration is the same timeframe in which a species will develop the tools
for inner space exploration (i.e. computers, cyberspace).  So I'd like to show that it is
at least a reasonable hypothesis that this combination of factors may converge to produce
the phenomena of a universal language.  The technological need, the economic incentives
and the comprehension of interstellar benefits should converge at approximately the same 
time in the development of a civilization breaking through the shell of their planet.

### What Language Would Aliens Speak?

Here I'm referring to
two different things: a global universal language and a language of the universe.  I've
thought about the benefits and drawbacks of engineering a global language before and such a
concept is fairly straightforward to explain. However, a singular "language of the universe" 
is new to me.  I've never heard anyone talk about a concept like this, although I'm certain 
that someone could find a dozen sci-fi novels that mention something like this.

What I'm conceiving is both the possibility of and the inevitable necessity for a language that 
is used across the universe.  It would be something that is independently discovered by almost 
every civilization, whereby transmitting the knowledge to use the language is not necessary. 
That semantics and morphemes/phonemes can be abstracted is not new.  I'm not really talking
about a communication protocol for conveying semantics (meaning) and data simultaneously.  

> That's not new.  We did that with data we sent out on Voyager, Carl Sagan's cosmic frisbee 
> ... because before it ventures too far outside the Oort Cloud, we'll probably fetch it, get it?  

It is fairly trivial to map from one language to another and to encode the means for doing so 
along with the content is not too complicated.  

What's my reasoning behind this idea of universal language? First, I'll briefly cover 
the benefits.  And then I'll 
explain how it could be possible.  It definitely is possible, though what would qualify is 
debateable.  First off, **math** is a universal language.  So that, in itself, qualifies,
though math itself isn't really what I'm talking about.  Neither is a communication
protocol for simultaneous transmission of semantics and content.  

What I want to show is that it *may be possible* for something between those two concepts 
to exist. That is, there may be a universal language, independently discoverable by any
sufficiently advanced civilization that is more apt for conveying meaning than math but
doesn't require a communication protocol to be established ad-hoc or ahead-of-time. 

### From Genomic Sequencing to a Universal Language

At the moment, I'm working on a genetic sequencing algorithm using GPU's and bitcrunching.
I'm not sure whether it'll will surpass existing sequencing algorithms, but what i've got so far
contains some blazingly fast components.  If I can manage to map these components into other 
constraints of typical sequencing algorithms (E.G. a binary trie) then I may be able to 
produce something on par with existing algorithms.  Possibly something between 1 and 3 orders
of magnitude faster on desktop/server environments and unconstrained in specialized computing 
environments.  Basically, it would be as scaleably fast as memory and GPU would allow it 
to be.  Implemented with FPGA's or ASIC's?  Even better.

#### Look at how fast that line dropped!

![Cost of Genome](/img/posts/2016-04-10-the-nature-of-space-time-and-information-implies-universal-language/genome-cost.jpg)

What if it weren't just cheap and fast to sequence human genome data, but to datamine it as
well.  Multiple sequence alignment would be trivially fast.
That's what I imagine may be possible with this algorithm. The design I'm planning could also
be matched up against an intractable problem. Who knows.

### An Engineered Global Language

However, working on this is got me thinking about an idea I had several years ago (around 2012) 
for a global language.  The connection is that the complexity of many bitcrunching algorithms is
dramatically reduced with a smaller character set.  A universal language is an idea Google 
would probably love, but one that would take decades of cultural change and social engineering 
to implement.

Why would Google love a universal language? Facebook? Twitter? Practically every software
business ever?  (Keep in mind that these are the benefits.  There are drawbacks as well)

#### (1) Dramatically reduced cost/time/complexity to index data to provide search.

Every useful app out there indexes their customer's data to provide search functionality.  For
the biggest apps -- again, think Facebook, Google, Twitter -- this presents wonderfully 
challenging engineering challenges, usually solved via stream processing ala Storm or Kafka.

This can be incredibly challenging.  And many key insights in data are not shared across
language barriers, as the software to process such insights is expensive to develop/deploy.
Machine learning to correlate semantics across languages is still fairly new. But, given
a universal language, that additional step isn't really necessary.

#### (2) Reduced complexity in business processes; decreased support costs

Dealing with multiple languages (though not very hard) can be expensive.  Any time you
significantly update your business processes, repackage a new product offering, build
a new marketing campaign or want to tap into a far-off market, you need to translate. 
Reduced translation cost isn't a critical piece of my argument.  English already 
functions as a kind of universal language.  There are reasons for that, including the 
simple latin alphabet.

#### (3) Instantaneous global market reach

Launch a new product? VR/AR? Web Service? Instant 100% global market penetration, given a 
few key assumptions of course.  Do you like money?  No?  OK, that's fair, your probably
voting for .... ok, nevermind.  Not really funny, I know.
Anyways, I'm guessing that you know someone who likes money
a lot.  I don't really, other than it's a means to an end for bringing change to the world.

Anyways, that guy that really likes money and built a product just to get lots of it?
That guy is reeeaaaalllly going to like 100% market penetration.  He's also going to like
that no matter where in the world a user joins, that user can interact with 100% of the
other users on that product.  Do you understand the added value to a network that this 
brings?  That guy that likes money does.  When 100% of nodes on a social network *could*
interact meaningfully with 100% of other nodes, that maximizes potential for 
interconnection.  However, sometimes it's useful from an analytics perspective to have
segments & pockets of more & less isolated nodes.

### Here's the kicker

#### (4) Dramatically reduced energy consumption

Energy consumption is the critically undeniable factor that will drive this change.

Software doesn't really use a huge amount of energy, in comparison with agriculture, 
transportation or home conveniences.  But it will be important enough, along
with other factors, to ensure that the development of a universal language is inevitable.
As more devices are added to the internet of things and as technology begins to pervade
everything, then the software to manage the ever-increasing graph of nodes will need
to become more complex as well.  

> Moar energies!

If every software problem is made
needlessly more complex by the introduction of language, forcing some text-related 
operations to consume between 10 and 100 times the energy they should, don't you think
that's an important reason to implement a change in the way people communicate?
I'm not saying that people will completely cease using their native languages, nor
should they.  Drawbacks to total implementation are explained shortly.

Barring the development of a dyson sphere absorbing nearly all of the radiation from the sun
or at least a globally deployed solar energy apparatus, then we're fucked.  We're 
going to need every last drop of energy we can get.  Every form of energy production 
(transduction) causes changes in the environment.  Every single one: solar (yes), wind 
(yes it does), biofuel (why not skip the middle man?).  Even fusion.  Especially fusion.  
Hydrogen is a limited resource.

> Quick idea: Look for alien life by trying to find abberations in element abundance from
> fusion.  Especially hydrogen/helium ratios.  It's probably not novel though.

### The Tower of Babel Crumbles

There are many drawbacks to be considered as well.  But, like I said, this is something
that is probably inevitable, though it may be a century before we see it completely
overtake the world.  

The main drawback that I see is reduced diversity.  It's a good thing that there are so many 
languages and so much diversity in the world.  Diversity in language, customs, beliefs,
subcultures, sexuality, etc.  It's all great because it allows us to explore life and ideas
in different ways.  None of us can assume that we have the right answer to how to live life.
If we remove the diversity, we remove our ability to explore life in search of a better answer.

Implementation of a universal language would require worldwide cooperation and global policy
changes implemented gradually, with some areas leading and others trailing.  Just like any
other global policy.  And in the pursuit of pushing a universal language on the world -- along
with many other globalization initiatives -- there develops this kind of inferred ideological
superiority.  Southpark would probably call this "smug" and it's a sense that one is better
than another because they've chosen to be ahead of the curve.  It stinks, it's arrogant, and
it's corrosive. 

> Again, none of us can assume that we have the right answer for how to life life.

Another drawback concerns the implementation costs, especially if we don't get it right.
Many times, in the real world --

-- Clearly, I have digressed.  Ahem.  Many times, in the real world, you want to simply
get from point A to point B, but there is no simple path in between the two.  And when
implementing a global shift to an engineered language, could there be such a path?  At 
least, there will be the all but certain developments of dialects that diverge, along 
with a lot of resistance to the idea.  Eughh, Newspeak ... that was the sound of me 
discovering exactly how how orwellian this entire article sounds.

And alas, the tower of babel crumbles always.  The very existance of a singular form of 
communication begets the conditions which create opportunity for competition. That is,
people naturally want to form localized dialects and develop idioms. They want to
develop their own colorful means of expressing themselves, revelating their emotions
and recounting their surroundings.  A singular form of communication means that anyone
within earshot could immediately understand. 

And what about when you discover that, by the time you've globally implemented your 
language, the design was flawed from the outset. Or that a newer design is better. 
Eeuughhh, Newspeak v3.7.  That sounds even worse.  My point is, how would we know what
the best design of such a language would be? 

Is there such a maximally "best" language?  What if there was?  What if it was
universally discoverable? That every sufficiently adv. civ. would arrive to the
exact same place. 

![But Why?](/img/posts/2016-04-10-the-nature-of-space-time-and-information-implies-universal-language/butwhy.gif)

## In time. All in due time.

### No, Seriously, It's Because E=MC^2

The speed of light is a serious buzz kill.  What do you mean we were born too late in an
ever-expanding universe to ever explore multiple galaxies?  Quite a common fate, actually,
considering there's a lower incidence of cataclysmic cosmic collisions in a universe
which has had a bit of time to expand.  But that's beside the point.  If there were a 
universal language, there'd be no need for the extra round trip(s) it'd take to establish
a communication protocol.

### 15 Minutes to Mars, Folks

The speed of light also implies that we aren't able to easily communicate with other beings.
It takes 15 minutes to talk to Mars! To Mars!! Ok, sometimes 5, but more often than not, 
it's more than 10 minutes -- both ways!!

Yeh, how you likin' relativity now? So, barring instantaneous communication methods -- ala
the Ansible from Ender's Game (it's real, folks, I promise) -- which bring along their 
own communication impediments, then we're S.O.L.  If you want to play phone tag with 
aliens, then maybe your grandkids will hear back.  Is that a bad joke?  I still haven't
seen Interstellar.  I heard it was good.  I want to see it.  Thing is, I made $3000 last
year.

Which brings me to my next point.  Maybe if someone could pay me to do something every
now and then, I'd stop dropping revolutionary technology on the internet.  I'd probably
be so busy, I'd never think about it. Here's a good one.  Remember the Ansible, from 
Ender's Game?  I promised, didn't I?  You have until I publish this article. After that,
time's up, Mr. Bond.

### Heady Crystals!! 

There should be some [very difficult] way of separating pairs of entangled particles, 
so that they never degrade.  Once you've got your particles, your going to want to break
them up and put them in crystals.  Got it?  Good.  Now develop a communication protocol
that enables you to affect the state of one particle, while simultaneously reading it
on the other end.  Now keep one crystal and send the other on a voyage through the galaxy
you should have a low-bandwidth means of communicating at beyond the speed of light.

Here's the tricky part: your mechanism can't read the state of a particle without affecting
it -- and the state of it's particle.  Kind of a Catch-22.  Maybe.  However, with a clever 
design and the right protocol, something like this should be possible.  But probably
low bandwith.  Still no lolcats on Mars, folks.  It's a tragedy.  

> Imagine, if you would: an interstellar world, where we explore the cosmos for thousands 
> of years, scouring the stars for life.  And we find it!  But, the aliens can't watch
> our latest lolcat videos.  OMGWTF?!  

Maybe this isn't possible, I don't know. Last time, I checked, it seemed like it might 
be theoritically impossible, but mostly an engineering challenge.  First, how do you 
construct such a mechanism to predictably interface with entangled quantum state. Do you
manipulate entangled ions embedded in doped crystals? Using lasers I'm sure. If it's cool,
it's got a laser.  Or maybe you design a kind of mobius crystal which entraps photons on
neverending dualistic path, with a hint of 
[Gömböc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6mb%C3%B6c). Kind of like an infinity scarf, 
but cooler.  Because it's a fucking mobius crystal.  I just made that shit up.  Just now. 

Second, how do you read the state without destroying the data transmitted from the other end.  
I imagine these challenges could be overcome.  Proper timing is the key! One can assume at 
each cycle that a particle would either be changed or not changed at each cycle.  So, 
assuming that each entangled pair is only to be used for one-way communication, either
from A -> B or from B -> A, then you should be able to alternate between particle states
that signify a one or a zero.  Basically, you're reading not the quantum state, but a
quantum state *change*.

Furthermore, with a bit more imagination, there may be another way to do this, which would
require cyclicly entangled particles.  I know, I know.  "It's not theoretically possible."
Neither was the cyclic shape of glucose molecules a few centuries ago. But with cyclicly
entangled particles, it'd be a bit easier to read state without overwriting.  Just 
imagining how to imbue cyclic entanglement on particles is tough.  I wonder if there 
are more complicated quantum entanglement mappings.  If so, how would each be useful?

And third, how does one protect against degradation of the entangled particles.  It'd
be a real bummer if you sent one of these heady crystals 100 lightyears away and it 
ran out of juice like an overused lithium battery.  And that brings me to the galactic
economics of Ansible crystals ... just kidding.  What about the economics of 
earth-technology with faster-than-light (FTL) communication?  How does software change,
if this is possible? 

> Have you ever heard anyone ask about how FTL and it's practical implementations 
> changes the economics of software and hardware?  I haven't. 

Language, I was writing about language. Not half-brained physics and hypothetical economics.  
Gee, imagine if I had the chance to actually study this stuff.  Then, I could be 
**creative *and* correct**.  But nope.  I guess I've been disconnected, folks.  They 
pulled the fucking plug on this guy.  Womp womp.  No plug for me.

Oh, one more quick idea.  What if it was possible to use pre-existing entanglement for
faster-than-light communication?  In say, stars which collided with the same cloud of
ionized gas for example.  It's probably not possible, but who knows.  Interesting to
think about.  Or ooo what if entanglement is really caused by micro-wormholes and space
is just an illusion obscuring a manifold where all points are equidistant.  Probably
not, but now I'm just making shit up.

![Silence When Gleep Glop Doth Speakth!!](/img/posts/2016-04-10-the-nature-of-space-time-and-information-implies-universal-language/gleep-glop.jpg)

#### "Silence When Gleep Glop Doth Speakth!!" ...

### Thus Spoke Gleep Glop

So, I've established or it should be easy to see that:

#### (1) A Global Language is necessary and beneficial for efficient algorithms & energy consumption.

Energy consumption will be critical to any civilizations who find themselves on a planet that 
they can escape -- some civilizations aren't blessed with enough adjacent supernovae for that!
Womp womp.  Guess you guys are just fucked then, huh.  No uranium?  GLHF.  I wouldn't pray to 
your god, I know that much.  Didn't give you any uranium?  What an asshole.  Damned a whole 
world of life right out the gate with a lack of resources to escape from the hellish curse 
of overpopulation.  Who would do that?  Not my God.

Terrestrial civilizations who find themselves with enough rare earth minerals for computers
and other assorted shiny things from San Fransisco will find the economics of software
irresistable.  Yes, the MeeToo's have a bizarro San Francisco.  This furthers the basis 
for establishing a global language, which provides a transition to the universal language.

#### (2) A Universal Language helps transcend the limitations imposed by relativity.

It's so aliens can talk to other aliens without having to wait for millenia.  It's like
Verizon, but for the Galaxy!  The Galaxy!!  The aliens just vomit out all possible 
communications in one spurt, to wherever their machine learning astronomy algorithms
detect the possibility of life.

Wellll... that is, unless instantaneous communication is possible. But, if the ansible 
is real, it requires transporting a physical object to whereever you want to communicate.
That's pretty expensive.  I aced galactic economics, can you tell?  And I'd hate to be 
on-call when the ansible thing breaks. 

> What do you mean I have to warp to R2-Sirius-1? Jesus, haven't you seen Interstellar?!

### Mechanics of a Written Universal Language

So, if a universal language does exist what would it look like?  Keep in mind these are
hardly fully developed ideas.  If there is such a universal language, it would take decades 
to identify, at least.

Well, since digital algorithms
enable the development of technology, especially the computers that further the development
of math via automated theorum proving, let's start there.  These same digital-based algorithms,
especially those indexing algorithms et al. that are accelerated by bitcrunching, perform best 
when encoding with  a base-2 count of symbols.  This may change with some quantum computing 
technologies, but that's a bit of a tangent.

But I don't think that a single universal written language would cut it.  I imagine a pair of
universal "writing" systems or encoding schemes that are similar in relation and function to
the Latin and Kanji scripts, but both would be isomorphic.  That's a fancy math word for
"interchangeable without loss of information." But Latin has 26 characters, so let's hypothesize
our simple universal written language has 16 different characters or graphemes, essentially. 
What's the advantage to 16 characters? More efficient edit distance algorithms.

What would the glyphs look like for each grapheme?  Well, if you have looked at enough scripts
from various languages, you'll notice that, you can group the characters
by functional attributes.  So, you'll notice that for some like the latin script and mostly
those western scripts derived from phoenician, there are a few letters
that have rotational symmetry: they look the same when rotated.  There are many that are not 
rotationally invariant. There are many letters that exhibit classic horizontal or vertical 
symmetry, but again, more do not.  A lower case t has both horizontal and vertical symmetry.

Why not have all letters exhibit some or all forms of symmetry? There is a functional purpose
to this.  It makes it difficult to read from the side or upside down when all letters exhibit
the same kind of symmetry.  You'll also notice that there are many letters which can be 
distorted to exhibit symmetries & various functional properties.  Interesting, eh?

My point is that, perhaps there is some mathematic intuition for enumerating and ordering 
these 16 or 32 graphemes to arrive at a written language that would be certain common sense
for ascended alien civilizations.  Perhaps the number of chars is inconsequential or extensible.
Perhaps the stroke number is correlated to the base-2 power (E.G. 4 stroke numbers would all be 
between base-3 and base-4).

### Semantics of a Universal Language

This kind of writing system would need to map tightly to the system of semantic modeling.  So
how does one model knowledge and meaning in such a universal way?  If the written symbols for
0 and 1 were to map to some "concepts," what would those be and why?  If you think about it, we
tend to perceive zero as nothingness and one as existance.  But what would it mean to read the 
following "words" in this universal language: 01, 10, 110 or 000? And how would the meanings of
those words change if we added the symbols 2 and 3? What would those symbols semantically bind
to?

This is a major challenge.  How does one convey menaing universally?  Are there some objects in
math that are so foundational that all meaning can be modeled on top of them?  Mathematic objects
are typically considered pretty soulless, without much capacity to carry implicit meaning not
externally attached.  How would one determine what "things" should be enumerated as concepts 
that can be used as first principles from which to combinate and define everything else?

As for the writing system, there should also be a form of writing similar to kanji, which has
its own algorithmic benefits.  Again, it's easier to index content written in kanji, but in
a slightly different way.  You can't misspell kanji, so it's harder to deviate from the norm.
Therefore, if you want to refer to the right concept, you have to use the right symbol, with
a few exceptions.  This makes content written in kanji easier to monitor for key terms.  And
overall easier to index, semantically. 

But this is not two universal written languages, this is a paired written language.  That is,
similar to how combinations of the simpler symbols should map to enumerated semantic concepts, 
each kanji-like character should map to a word composed of the simler symbols.  But the pairings
here should be composed such that the graph representing the semantic modeling system is as *pure*
and *simple* as possible.  There should be some "purest" such graph, where every concept can
be expressed as a simple conjugation of existing concepts, but the complexity of the graph is
minimalized.  

As we work more with machine learning, we will likely gravitate towards a graph
such as this.  There is already much work being done, where the semantics modeled by english
is contrasted by the semantics modeled by another language.  It's interesting to see the
spacing and correlation between semantic symbols used in one language versus another.  

### Grammar of a Universal Language

The grammar is another major challenge and one that I haven't spent much time thinking about.
Is there one superier word order? SOV? SVO? OVS? IMO, they're all basically equivalent.  I
need to learn more about context-free grammars before I can say for sure.  I do know that
inflexion or tone of voice can cue a listener into parsing a sentence with an alternative
grammar structure, but doing so is quite complicated and very confusing for both parties.

Are there similar symmetries that exist in grammar systems generated by different word orders?
Would some of these symmetries and their presence/absence cue us into a axiomatic word order
or grammar system? Again, I need to learn a lot more, but it seems that there is at least
the possibility of a universal system of grammer.

### Quantum Computing Shifts the Foundation for Language

> Just go with it, for the sake of extending the above concept of a universal
> language to that of 

It definitely does.  The question is how.  Language as it's understand now and text 
as it's encoded and rendered needs digital representation.  However, from my limited
understanding of quantum computing, information only seems to be attached to discrete
outputs towards the output of a circuit.  Otherwise, the quantum circuits seem to be
intermeshing probabilistic functions.  Again, that is my 10,000ft view based on a
limited understanding of quantum algorithms, gates and circuits.

How would this shift the foundations underpinning a universal language?  Well, if one
can process information without needing discrete units of information, that is very
interesting indeed.  Could one entirely communicate from within such a fluid system
without needing to assign meaning to anything?  I think so.  Retreating to philosophy,
and in particular the regress problem in epistemology, where one must provide a firm 
kernel of knowledge from which to draw all other inferences, it is always possible
to define a concept wholly in terms of it's relationships with all other concepts and 
it's relationships with the combinations of all other concepts.  To me, this is similarly 
fluid.  And therefore, the fluid information in a quantum system never needs to be
rigidly defined at all, until one needs to output digital data from the system.  

But for a language completely based on the nature of information in a quantum system,
where the exchanges and correspondances never need to leave the fluidity of a quantum
system, one never needs to map and encode the quantum information to a digital 
representation.  Therefore, with a Quantum Universal Language, there would be no
need for a phonographics or logographic writing system at all.  One would exchange
information solely through quantum entanglement.  There would likely be a need for
a schema of systems of mapping entangled information, along with the functions used
to manipulate that information.

If you didn't understand the above paragraphs, it's probably because I didn't explain
very well.  Basically:

So, tell me again why I should settle for working on wordpress designs 
(no graphic design experience) when I have clearly demonstrated
the creativity and talent that far outweights my flaws.  
IMO, such work would be setting me up for failure because 
it doesn't harness my strengths.  And why should my only option at the moment
be a temp agency?  Really?  Because I'm pretty sure that's worse than bestbuy.
