really need the article to appeal to the emotions of people who are
likely to disagree with me (on a reactive, knee-jerk basis)
- so i need to structure my content just right, otherwise those people
  will just stop reading or put up a mental block

wtf else can i say instead of "it's important" .. "it's crucial"
... eugh. need more expressive language...

Illegal immigration is a serious long-term issue. Not to be alarmist,
but it's a bit of a powder keg. The further we let it go on, the worse
it gets. Regardless of who's side you're on, you need to hear me out.
The truth is, there aren't "sides" on this issue; it is painful for
everyone involved!

### Illegal Immigration Hurts, Whether You Are:

#### &#x2605; From A Family with Four Hundred Year Old Roots in America

#### &#x2605; The Child of Immigrant Parents Who Struggled to Get here

#### &#x2605; Part of a Family Who Illegally Crossed into America Chasing Opportunity

In 5,000 words or less, I'm going to provide you with the realest
summary of why it's a painful issue for everyone involved. You'll be
able to empathize with what illegal immigrants are going through in
this country. I'm going to try to describe what that's like, but I
don't actually know any illegal immigrants, so you'll have to forgive
me for that. And as much as you can try to put yourself in someone
else's shoes, you'll never truly know how that feels until you're
there.

#### Illegal Immigration Indicates a Failure of Border Security

Furthermore, I'll elaborate on how illegal immigration contributes to
other problems the country is facing. It's an indication of a failure
of border security. I'll discuss the challenges facing a resolution of
illegal immigration. These include challenges that are cultural,
financial, strategic or political. For example, publicly announcing
the policy details will change behavior. If we say "Free amnesty!
Citizenship for anyone for three months," what do you think that will
do? People might rush the border.

#### We can't solve this problem until we prevent people from entering the country illegally

Amnesty doesn't exactly solve the problem, by the way. People can
still come here illegally, so what does that do anyways? The debate on
this issue is ridiculous. This is why we need a wall. I hate the
fucking wall, but we need it. The wall is mostly a symbol, by the
way. I don't care what the !@#$ it is, so long as it means that the
number of people crossing the border slows to a trickle.

# [Illegal Immigration is Painful for Everyone](#illegal-immigration-is-painful-for-everyone)

Illegal immigration is an issue where everyone is affected, regardless
of how it personally affects you. It's an issue where everyone should
want to pursue policy changes for their own benefit. Instead, the
debate in this country frames the discussion in terms of race and
ethnicity. This is counterproductive because there are domestic
policy changes would would be beneficial for everyone, even the people
here illegally! And my motivation for writing this is partly derived
from my concern for the problems they face.

In an oversimplification, I'm going to divide families and people
living in America into four classes of citizenship. There are those
who have been citizens since the Baby Boomer generation or
before. Next, there are American families who have been citizens since
or after Generation X. These are more recent immigrants. Third, there
are immigrants working or studying in the country on a visa. I would
include those staying on an expired visa in this class. Finally, there
are illegal immigrants, who entered the country illegally.

Again, it's an oversimplification, but our domestic policies towards
illegal immigration affects each class differently.

## Citizens Since or Before the Baby Boomer Generation


- why draw this distinction? aren't we all equally US Citizens? Well,
  yes, in the eyes of the law.

    - +3 generation americans (roots in america since baby-boomer
      generation)
      - i need to emphacize that i'm not saying that these people are
        more american or that others are less american.
      - making this distinction b/w recent immigrants and long time
        citizens is important because their lives are a bit different
        - people who have been here for a long time have deep roots
          - large support networks when things go wrong. they probably
            know a few dozen family members, possibly in their own
            city

## Citizens Since or After Generation X


      - people who just became citizens might not have such
        extensive roots. when things go wrong, it might be harder
        for them to reach out.
      - or, if they are feeling the effects ethnic discrimination,
        when they're citizens and have been, how do you think that's
        going to make these people feel?
        - if effects from such treatment are serious, that further
          isolates families who would probably otherwise be very
          patriotic!
        - remember, these are people who worked hard to find
          a way to get here. they came to america for a reason, even
          though it was tough.

## Immigrants on Visa (title)

    - legal immigrants working on a visa/etc
      - these may be the least integrated people. i've been in a
        similar position, where i was living in a place and i didn't
        know anyone. and i went through serious problems. it was tough
        being alone and i know that no one wanted me to succeed.
        - and there were other times I was in a new place and I met
          some really amazing people. and they knew i had just moved a
          dozen or more hours away from home, where i didn't know
          anyone.
        - and instead of waiting for me to make the first move, they
          worked hard to make me feel comfortable. they made sure i
          was included and wanted to get to know me. i'll never forget
          what that feels like and i've been there several times too.
      - so, which experience would you prefer? if we could make one
        or the other experience happen more often in this country,
        which should it be?
    - this should include people who are here because they overstayed
      their visa or whatever.

## Illegal Immigrants

    - illegal immigrants
      - they are perhaps the worst off in this whole situation.
      - the policies at the state and federal level seek to punish
        employers for hiring illegal immigrants. this makes sense, but
        it has the unintended consequence of making things tough for
        people who just wanted a better life. and they were willing to
        risk themselves and their families to seek out the American
        Dream.
      - so it's tough out there for people who are here illegally.

  - btw, illegal immigrants are criminals, by definition
      - but this statement doesn't actually make any judgements about
        their character
      - by definition someone labelled as an "illegal immigrant" must
        have committed the crime of entering the country illegally
    - most of these people of good character and only came here for one
      of the following reasons:
      - fleeing bad circumstances in latin america or south america
      - to pursue the american dream for themselves or their children

# Why is it Challenging?

Why is it such a hard problem to tackle? Honestly, America has way
bigger problems *at the moment*. Yet, the more time passes, the harder
this becomes to resolve. The solutions will be more expensive and
tensions will be higher, stagnating policy change.

- (2) why is it so hard to solve?
  - basically no one wants to do what it takes to fix the problem
  - it doesn't seem like it's that big of a problem
    - it's very subtle and the longer it goes on, the larger the
      problem could be
  - there just aren't any good answers
  - many of the "solutions" don't address the underlying problem:
    - there is no real border security.
    - that means that people keep crossing the border illegally
  - even when we run out of ... ?? hmm??? what was i going to write?
  - the southern border with mexico is huge!
  - amnesty is a legal nightmare
      - it's unfair to those who went through the real process
      - completely lacks controls
      - proclamation of an amnesty program is tantamount to
        advertising free citizenship for anyone who can make it in in
        time
      - and there is no way to implement amnesty in enough time to
        avoid a massive influx of illegal immigration
    - massive deportation may work, but is equally riddled with
      problems.
      - obviously, there is an opportunity for racism. it would
        definitely


## Future Consequences of a Poor Policy

With each year that passes, the consequences of inaction become
increasingly severe, including long-lasting cultural problems!

> **E.G.** You put up a forcefield and stop people from entering the
> country. You then grant everyone amnesty. Ok, problem solved, right?
> **WRONG!!** Now you have a dozen million people, potentially bitter,
> who lack the same level of education. They don't have resumes and
> they don't have very much money either.

So, have you actually thought out how these policies will play out?
OK, so then, aside from national security, what is the single, worst
aspect of illegal immigration? It is the cultural isolation. The de
facto consequences here might as well be segregation. And we
absolutely can not have a segment of our population, long deprived of
education and employment opportunities, who is isolated along mostly
ethnic boundaries!

## Longterm Ethnic Tension is Agony

I cannot emphasize this enough. That kind of crap ferments
longstanding ethnic tension. The kind of problems that cannot simply
be resolved. And yet, our inaction is going to further contribute to
this? Tearing down the real segregation was bad enough. Five decades
later and we're still dealing with long-term cultural problems from
that. And ... we want another source of problems like that? Hell no!

That's one reason I care enough to risk sounding like a insensitive
shithead. Tolerance? Discrimination? How do we improve these? How can
someone improve a social issue they can't talk about? Yes, we should
be more tolerant! Absolutely! But we also have to be tolerant of
people who are intolerant. That doesn't mean we should like it, no!

#### What Safe Space?

(title)

If you completely cut someone off who's been labelled as racist, what
does that do? Has anyone in this country actually watched American
History X? How does the character Lamont breakthrough to the neonazi
character? Does he do it by ignoring that character? Avoiding him?
Isolating him? No! Just the opposite.

#### Respond to Intolerance with Tolerance

If we want to resolve ethnic tensions in America, we need
communication and we can't immediately respond to a differing
viewpoint by escalating tension. We have to respond to intolerance
itself with tolerance!

> Just to clarify, the following is not a critique on Black Lives
> Matter protestors, but instead is advice for any social movement.

#### Speak Through Tremendous Action

Watch how people react to those who disagree with them. I admire
people like Gandhi and Dr. King because they dealt with a lot of
outright injustice and they did it with grace! They knew their actions
spoke more powerfully than any words they could ever utter. They knew
they were surrounded by people who wanted change and people who were
vitriously opposed to it.

#### Truth as a Strategy

But, how did they respond? They allowed their actions to speak for
themselves and they allowed their opponents actions to speak for their
opponents and they believed that people would see things as they
were. That is it! Their strategy was truth! Truth and nothing more!

#### Truth and Loving Our Enemy

Except perhaps loving their enemy enough to grant him or her
forgiveness for their ignorance. And they suffered for this. They
suffered through the ignorance and intolerance, but maintained the
grace to forgive their enemies, right through the midst of it all.
It's not easy to maintain your inner peace in the middle of some grave
injustice.

There are too many people on all sides with insensitive and/or flat
out wrong viewpoints. Some of my own viewpoints are insensitive.  I'm
sorry if that's the case. I absolutely do not condone or intend to
encourage any kind of racist or intolerant bullshit. We need to come
together in this country.

## the pros don't outweigh the cons

The illegal immigration debate in America is messy. The PC police
prevent people from...

- title should imply that there aren't enough perceived benefits to
  justify the implementation of policy
  - stifled discussion doesn't allow us to have the conversation that
    would allow the public to understand the things they need to know
    for the issue to accumulate the momentum it needs for action
    - jesus this is like the worst sentence ever.
    - i need that in like 3 words

However, if being "tolerant" means tiptoeing around immigration and if
it's racist to say that there are people in this country who came here
illegally, how the !@#$ are we going to resolve these problems? And if
you supposedly stand opposed to intolerance and racism, I hate to tell
you, but your inaction here is going to make those problems worse!

    - that doesn't present enough incentives to be resolved
      - which is precisely why it's so dangerous: current trends in
        policy, while promising (i need more info, just assuming there
        has been some progress here) are not nearly enough
      - there just aren't enough benefits, politically, to really
        tackle this issue

    - and by acting like it's not a big deal really puts us at risk
        of lackluster progress
        - or acting like we have taken appropriate action to solve the
          problem, instead of pushing the envelope with our discussion
      - basically, if it continues for another decade or so, we risk
        to having to deal with 6% of the population, instead of 3%

# Why is it a problem?

(summarize, then lead into list of problems)

- (1) provide a definitive, balanced statement of illegal immigration
  - why is it a problem? why should you care?
    - establish that this problem is felt differently for different
      groups of people.
    - if you care about problems stemming from ethnic tensions,
      then you would want to resolve this earlier than later
      - because every year, the problem gets worse
      - and the larger the disparity there is between legal and
        illegal populations, the larger the ethnic tension there will
        be. so again, if you care about fallout from ethnic tension,
        then you'll want to do something about it sooner than later.
      - there are 11 million people in the country illegally now
        - if this number is 20 million instead, then that approaches
          0.5% to 1.0% of the population!

### National Security

  - far and beyond, the biggest problem is national security
      - you just can't, especially not in the 21st century. not in
        america. that's just a giant red flag. we're worried about al
        qaeda, but 11 million people just walked on in? man, that's 11
        million chances for some terrible organization to have already
        snuck someone in.



# Problems Related to Illegal Immigration

#### (1) Jobs

The jobs that are being taken are really the least of our concerns.

#### (2) Income Taxes

    - (2) they don't pay income taxes.
      - it's not like they are dancing their way to the bank though

#### (3) Lack of Employment Rights

    - (3) they don't have employment rights.
      - this leads to tension, risk and abuse in (illegal) employment
        agreements, where they have no options for recompense

    - (4) domestic policies meant to stem the demand for cheap labor from
      illegal immigrants
      - these actually stoke the flames because now you have a slice
        of the population who is essentially backed into a corner
        - and is being starved out
      - they risk serious consequences of backlash from legal and
        illegal immigrants of specific ethnicities (not just limited
        to latin american ancestry)
    - (5) illegal immigrants seeking work (to feed their families) are
      committing crimes by working.  employers hiring illegal
      immigrants are committing crimes by employing them.
      - there are no social programs in place for this major chunk of
        our population: ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE with no social security
        in place (in the truest sense of the term)
        - that's three percent of our population with no options for
          stability and nowhere to go, if it gets "really fucking cold
          out."
      - people supporting illegal immigrants may also be committing
        crimes if they are knowingly doing so
    - (6) their children can't receive education (depending on
      circumstance)
      - this leads to large amounts of idle, uneducated youth
        - it's bad. and when the issue is resolved, these children
          will suffer lasting consequences, as they won't easily
          conform to others of the same age in the education system
        - major source of long term consequences.
        - a certain minority who, if granted amnesty, *may* feel
          ashamed to admit to their past, for fear of judgement and
          for fear of being labeled as someone who is less capable in
          the workplace
          - because of a lack of education
          - or because a perceived lack of education
    - (7) if strict policies on stemming demand for illegal immigrant
      employment are working, then things are going to get real hard
      for illegal immigrants, including those who would otherwise be
      "model uncitizens"
      - this leads to about 3% of the population suffering serious
        hardship, with little options for money to resolve those
        problems.
      - that will lead people to partake in organized crime
    - (8) these people will become culturally isolated from the rest
      of america, having to live in the shadows, basically
      - major, major source of misunderstanding and conflict
      - i've never actually met someone that i know to be an illegal
        immigrant. never spoken to someone like that.
    - (9) there is no assurance that these immigrants have valid
      identification from another country
      - where do we send them back?
        - if they have no identification. they will probably lie and
        say their from tijuana or cuidad juarez.
      - there is major potential for abuse of our own systems here
        - someone may manipulate the system into getting a free plane
          ticket to basically anywhere they want
        - that's probably not actually such a serious threat though.
    - (10) the burden of cost to monitor and deport is placed on taxpayers
      - who can't be sure that there is a coherent strategy for
        actual resolution
      - this forms a bureaucracy, who's budget from year-to-year
        actually requires maintainence of the problem ... to some
        extent, anyways.
        - because of congressional and executive oversight, it also
        requires establishing reports demonstrating reasonable
        progress
      - but this is a major problem because the incentives behind each
        of the players suffer from major, major overhang and stifled
        discussion.
        - overhang as in the incentives are like a really wobbly jenga
          tower.
    - (11) implementation of policy risks fracturing families
      - when the discussion to construct a coherent policy never
        really occured.  or at least not to the extent that i would
        like to believe is necessary.
        - and i cover how a viable strategy requires secrecy, but what
          i'm saying if no one knows the goals we are pushing towards
          with resolving illegal immigration, how can they know how to
          react?
    - (12) and there's the major security risk when people connected
      to terrorism try to slip in.
    - (13) and if amnesty is announced, we can be sure that these
      people will try to slip in.

# What are the Answers?

summary
- some of these won't appeal to conservatives because ... the
  government has to finance it. my response to this is: look at the
  longterm consequences of prolonging inaction or trying to implement an
  ineffective policy.
  - those are going to be incredibly expensive
  - it's frustrating, i know. but if there's a better answer, i'd love
    to hear it.
- also describe the problems caused by a disorganized strategy
- goals for an ideal policy?
  - stops more people from crossing the border!
  - applies amnesty to ~20-50% of existing illegal immigrants over 4 years
    - just pulling those numbers from thin air
    - but whatever it is, it should be hard. it should act as an
      implicit filter, so that the people who have qualities that
      contribute to society stay
      - it should be risky. like "i dont know if i can do that, but if i
        work hard, then maybe"
      - it should be challenging, like military service would be
        challenging
    - it should be fair
      - obviously, something like national guard service wouldn't work
        for everyone (also ... are these people we want to train and
        give guns?)
    - it should be robust:
      - in terms of preventing unintended problems
      - or circumvention of measures
  - mitigates some of longterm problems that could result
      - e.g. problems where citizens receive amnesty, but are shut out
        of services afterwards ... something we don't want
    - it absolutely must account for the disparity in education &
      employability. mandatory.
  - should be something that is appealing for people
    - but also fair to those who have been here. or came here legally


## A Disorganized Strategy for Immigration Means:

    - increased tensions for illegal and legal immigrants here
    - any concerted strategy for solving the problem requires some
      element of secrecy to be effectively implemented to prevent any
      unintended response
      - this necessitates circumventing the democratic process in
        congress
        - if you can't openly discuss something or suggest tactics
          because of it, then it's hard to put it into action in a
          democratic system
      - lack of discussion means that if the strategy changes from
        year to year and term to term, no one is going to know
        - which basically means there can be no coordinated, coherent
          strategy.
        - if you can't coordinate how the strategy changes from term
          to term (because of the secrecy) then how can you ensure
          that certain long-term tactics are properly executed
          - and certain long-term objectives are met

### Economic Policy

not really sure this will be very effective.
  - the solution starts by addressing economic/political issues in
    neighboring states (mexico)
    - we need work with mexico to establish mutually beneficial
      policies which create opportunities there
      - Microsoft manufactured the original xbox in guadalajara, for
        example.
    - transporting products from mexico should be cheaper.  right now,
      the transportation channels available to push products out of
      mexico and into america are suboptimal, AFAIK. i don't actually
      have much knowledge on the specifics, but i'm making inferences
      from a few key pieces of info
      - from what i know, i'm tending towards thinking that mexico has
        an infrastructure problem that prevents product from being
        efficiently exported
        - but i haven't researched this at all
    - whatever policy we undertake here needs to factor in
      strengthening our relationship with mexico.
    - mexican authorities need to be involved in stemming the flow
      - we need to present them with a choice, essentially
        - positive reinforcement for demonstrated traction towards
          solving this problem.
          - our numbers get better stateside, we encourage policies
            which help the situation
          - examples include cooperation on shared infrastructure
            projects or encouragement of manufacturing opportunities
            - however, if it's hard enough to create jobs in america,
              what business do we have promising to create jobs
              elsewhere, that's dumb
        - ... i don't really want to say "negative reinforcement" here
          - but we need to find means of motivating action here

### Structure the Incentives

  - need to motivate the legal and illegal immigrant populations to
    action
    - consequences for illegal immigrants to cooperate can't all be
      negative.
    - seriously, what incentive would an illegal immigrant have for
      putting themselves at risk to cooperate with the system?
    - i don't really know what our options are here... but i'd love to
      explore them and hear what ideas people have

### Attention and Compromise from Both Parties

  - and finally, solving this problem requires attention and
    compromise from both parties
    - the longer we wait, the worse it gets and the more negativity
      it generates.
    - we need some form of amnesty, the implementation of such a
      policy has it's own problems (stated above)
      - mostly, it's difficult to determine what is fair and what is
        just,
        - when requirements and process for this must remain secret.
        - and the discussion of it
