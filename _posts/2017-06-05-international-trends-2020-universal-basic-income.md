excerpt: "
Economic growth ultimately stems from the net contributions of
individuals. It's built from the ground up. We know that we are going
to have dozens of millions of unemployed between ages 20 and 60 by the
2030's. The point is to invest that human potential and manpower to
get the greatest return possible in anticipation of greater future
threats to human existance. More challenging than the operational
aspects is convincing Americans that this is not only necessary, but
should be enthusiastically embraced when technology seems to remove
most constraints. To do this we need a cultural transformation to
produce a society built on values and character with a strong sense of
identity and duty."

# [UBI Is Not Inevitable](#ubi-is-not-inevitable)

UBI is attractive because it appears to meet certain inevitable needs.
Automation will eventually create sky-high unemployment rates, thereby
triggering social unrest. However, the second and third order effects
of UBI's implementation are catastrophic, so it is incredibly unwise
to assume UBI to be an inevitable economic development. It is not the
need for UBI that is exigent, but the need to handle unavoidably high
rates of unemployment.

> But, I'm not trying to win a popularity contest here.

<a name="why-does-silicon-valley-care-so-much" />

### [Why Does Silicon Valley Care So Much?](#why-does-silicon-valley-care-so-much)

Why do you hear so much from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs about UBI?
Because they recognize the effects their products will unavoidably
have on labor markets and are wise enough to position themselves in
anticipation. As more products are virtualized and more nodes in the
economy are singularized into Silicon Valley's products, where do the
jobs go and what happens as currency flows into the hands of fewer and
fewer? So if UBI dispenses tons of artificial liquidity into the
economy, who do you think will benefit most as products are
virtualized?

Silicon Valley's desire to posture themselves to handle unemployment
is not selfishly motivated. They know it's real and genuinely want
handle this, but the people affected will look for people in power who
profited from business and policy.

<a name="complexity-theory-partially-determines-the-progression-of-unemployment" />

### [Complexity Theory Partially Determines the Progression of Unemployment](#complexity-theory-partially-determines-the-progression-of-unemployment)

Computational complexity of specific problems determines
the degree to which automation affects the economy, as well as this
trend's timing, pacing and completeness. Additionally, the quantum
computing's availability and applicability of causes a second major
wave in the trend of automation.

<a name="the-employer-of-last-resort" />

### [The Employer of Last Resort](#the-employer-of-last-resort)

The correct answer is an option for universal service. That is, the
government becomes the employer of last resort. This solution avoids
product-classification, artificial regulation of markets, the
complexity of a possible dual currency system and all the resulting
economic distortion. However, this solution does not avoid the need
for the government to finance this labor. National service also
requires that we establish logistics and operations mobilize between
20 and 100 million Americans. This must be done five to ten years
ahead of time.

<a name="what-we-build-ends-up-building-us" />

### [What We Build Ends Up Building Us](#what-we-build-ends-up-building-us)

The main advantage to National Service over UBI is that what we build
ends up building us. We need to rebuild infrastructure anyways.

<a name="the-pragmatic-implementation-of-ubi" />

# [The Pragmatic Implementation of UBI](#the-pragmatic-implementation-of-ubi)

UBI can be packaged in various forms, including tax credits and other
systems of wealth redistribution. The pragmatic implementation of UBI
is disappointing and even when expenditures of UBI cash aren't
regulated, it still results in economic distortion and disruption of
incentivation structures. In the long-term it is economically
unsustainable, but the problems it addresses are unavoidable.

UBI where expenses are controlled ends up being a transition into a
command economy. Several of the following criticisms below only apply
to UBI when its usage is regulated, but can still be extended to be a
criticism of tightly regulated economies in general.

<a name="product-classifications-and-restriction-of-ubi-expenditures" />

### [Product Classifications and Restriction of UBI Expenditures](#product-classifications-and-restriction-of-ubi-expenditures)

UBI just will not work without mechanisms in place to ensure that
people spend UBI on actual living expenses. It requires infrastructure
for monitoring purchases and reprimanding abuses of UBI income.
Without restricting UBI expenditures, there will be individuals and
groups who will siphon away the government liquidity injected into
society. Those groups include your friendly neighborhood drug dealer
as well as corporations like Starbucks selling lattes for $5.

<a name="#regulated-ubi-is-a-pseudo-currency" />

### [Regulated UBI is a Pseudo Currency](#regulated-ubi-is-a-pseudo-currency)

The system of product classifications essentially creates an economic
system with two currencies. Instead of a simple dollar *for all debts,
public and private*, the dollar becomes the currency of the rich and
employed, who can buy whatever they want. For the rest of us, an
actual UBI policy meant to mitigate unintended consequences instead
produces another unintended consequence: a pseudo-currency. The UBI
dollar is not for all debts, public and private. It is for all debts
that are valid living expenses. This essentially turns the government
into your mom, who might give you money as long as it is spent on
something she knows you really, really need.

<a name="#product-classification-determines-marketability" />

### [Product Classification Determines Marketability](#product-classification-determines-marketability)

Think about the implications of this in context with the UBI's raison
d'etre. Our country would only ever consider UBI because we need to
mitigate the effects of unemployment rates ranging from 15-50%.
Without some policy in place to handle the second and third order
effects of automation, unemployment rates such as these are realistic
for the 2030's. If UBI is the policy utilized to ameliorate this, then
for 15-50% of the population without full-time employment, their
income is almost completely in UBI pseudo-dollars.  The set of
products a UBI-dependent person can purchase is almost totally limited
to government-approved products.

<a name="regulated-ubi-is-a-big-government-nightmare" />

### [Regulated UBI is a Big Government Nightmare](#regulated-ubi-is-a-big-government-nightmare)

If the government restricts the purchasing power of a major segment of
population, this means that only UBI-approved products are viable in
the marketplace. To increase the marketability of products in a UBI
system, then lobbying to have it approved can make or break your
business model. This inserts bureaucracy into every facet of life. In
a very simple way, gives the government an unimaginable amount of
power and sets up the government to be used as a tool to achieve
economic ends. So, what happens?

<a name="the-lobbyists-win" />

### [The Lobbyists Win](#the-lobbyists-win)

What results? A massive incentive to lobby for the reclassification of
products and to enact major changes in UBI policy implementation. In a
UBI system, what's worth lobbying for? Increased marketability. Yet,
restricting the purchasing power of UBI via product classification is
the only way the government can fairly dispense cash to the
chronically unemployed without having the liquidity spent on Starbucks
lattes and other vices. If the corporate lobbyists win and everything
is classified as a UBI product, it doesn't work. And on the flip side,
a dual-currency system where nothing is marketable unless lobbied to
regulators Washington places power in the hands of regulators and
causes economic turbulence.

<a name="regulation-and-the-vulnerability-of-democracy-to-subversion" />

### [Regulation and the Vulnerability of Democracy to Subversion](#regulation-and-the-vulnerability-of-democracy-to-subversion)

Regulatory frameworks can be manipulated via suggestion or outright
subversion, amplifying inefficiencies in tightly regulated markets.
This leads to a less competitive domestic economy, compared to other
players in the global economy. Manipulating regulatory rules and the
institutions that create them is a weapon in economic warfare. This
weapon becomes more powerful as the degree of amplification that
second and third order effects via regulatory rules have on markets.
Additionally, the number of regulatory rules needed in a UBI system
grows as the system evolves.

Worst of all, even if groups or corporations don't leverage regulation
as a tool for economic manipulation, the government is unable to
perform its responsibilities. This leads to inefficient markets,
fluctuating prices for both products and financial assets, and general
price increases for products across the economy.

<a name="studies-need-to-focus-on-systemic-effects-of-ubi" />

### [Studies Need to Focus on Systemic Effects of UBI](#studies-need-to-focus-on-systemic-effects-of-ubi)

Most studies will focus on first or second order effects of UBI, but
they will do so in isolation. Even when UBI is provided to entire
communities or villages, it is fundamentally different than when
provided to an entire region, state or nation. And in this way, the
UBI studies will primarily identify positive results. This will result
in cognitive bias, where myopic studies crowd out common sense and
dialogue about systemic response to UBI.

<a name="ubi-must-account-for-geoeconomic-variation" />

### [UBI Must Account for Geoeconomic Variation](#ubi-must-account-for-geoeconomic-variation)

The cost of living varies dramatically from place to place. As climate
change alters weather patterns, agricultural infrastructure will need
to be repositioned. The price and availability of water will, in
particular, have a dramatic affect on the cost of living and the cost
of food. Real estate prices will fluctuate and most of this
geoeconomic variation over time will be unpredictable. This means we
need to invest our resources wisely and be prepared to refinance new
infrastructure. Strong dynamics in geoeconomic variation will make it
difficult to fairly distribute UBI and to do so such that areas
hard-hit by geoeconomic variation will have received a fair sum of
money.

Wealth distribution is essentally theft. It is difficult to ethically
or morally justify redistribution of wealth, especially since we are
*incapable* of doing so fairly.

<a name="overregulation-decentivizes-and-stagnates-innovation" />

### [Overregulation Decentivizes and Stagnates Innovation](#overregulation-decentivizes-and-stagnates-innovation)

Disappointing NEET's and basement dwellers nationwide, the pragmatic
implementation of UBI creates economic turbulence and renders the
domestic economy vulnerable to global competition. The regulation
deincentivizes innovation and stagnates the process by which
innovative new products can become marketable.

<a name="business-is-about-making-assumptions" />

# [Business is About Making Assumptions](#business-is-about-making-assumptions)

Business is about developing assumptions in contrast to the prevailing
understanding that enables someone to posture their product or service
in anticipation of changing trends. This aspect of business is
fundamental. The shifting long-term objectives and confusing
implementation details of UBI policy, as they are commonly understood
by the public, lead to an inability to make lasting assumptions about
economic trends. In anticipation of shifting policy that invalidates
these assumptions, investors and entrepreneurs evaluating a business
model will mostly refrain from investing. There's no point in
financing a business whose model is invalidated by policy changes,
potential or inevitable.

<a name="inductive-modeling-and-risk-appetite" />

### [Inductive Modeling and Risk Appetite](#inductive-modeling-and-risk-appetite)

Generally, any detraction from the ability to make valid predictive
assumptions that hold true over time impairs the identification and
execution of economically viable opportunities. Cost and risk become
difficult to measure or are measured using a model invalidated by
future policy changes. If one can assume that there are no policy
changes, then investors have a much larger risk appetite, which leads
to higher growth amid stable policy conditions. Heavily regulated
environments with high policy turnover, high barrier to entry and an
inherently limited market do not promote innovation.

<a name="combinatorics-category-theory-induction-and-higher-order-logic" />

### [Combinatorics, Category Theory, Induction and Higher-Order Logic](#combinatorics-category-theory-induction-and-higher-order-logic)

These generalizations about business are related to
[induction puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_puzzles),
where the ability to make assumptions via inductive logic allows one
to carve away at the problem space. One uses induction to
combinatorially evaluate valid configurations of the system. If
induction is required, then the difficulty of the problem is
exponentially more complex. Potential policy changes essentially add
variables to be combinated with induction and evaluated for
optimization and/or maximization. That's why you should diversify your
asset portfolio.

<a name="regulation-and-artificial-economic-dynamics" />

# [Regulation and Artifical Economic Dynamics](#regulation-and-artificial-economic-dynamics)

Capitalism essentially harnesses the same math behind machine learning
to create evolutionary dynamics. These "reified maths" form the
invisible hand that confers advantage to the best marketed, best
formulated or best packaged products. Free market systems reduce
inefficiencies in an economy, delivering more value to citizens
domestically and making the economy more competitive globally.

A poor implementation of UBI will trigger a collapse of capitalism.
Capitalism isn't capitalism at all when an authority artificially and
severely restricts choice. This places enormous power in the hands of
regulators in Washington and the lobbyists who court them. The
regulators decide who wins and who loses in a market and they are
inept at doing so.

<a name="price-instability-cascades-through-a-products" />

### [Price Instability Cascades Through Product Dependency Trees](#price-instability-cascades-through-product-dependency-trees)

The scale of market inefficiency increases by triggering a cascading
increase in prices across all types of products, since any product or
service has a list of component products in its dependency tree. So,
price increases are higher for the consumer because those products are
higher up the food chain, so to speak.

This dynamic creates a feedback loop, which is just one of many
between the mechanisms for amount/distribution of UBI provided and the
amplification of UBI-driven effects in the economy like price
stability and market efficiency. The effects are more strongly
pronounced when UBI transactions are regulated.

<a name="positive-feedback-loops-in-price-inflation-and-currency-inflation" />

### [Positive Feedback Loops in Price Inflation and Currency Inflation](#positive-feedback-loops-in-price-inflation-and-currency-inflation)

The price inflation above is related to the relative value and demand
of goods. It may occur alongside currency inflation, which is all but
certain because the tax volume cannot be established through
*competitive and profitable corporate enterprise*, which means
government expenditures must be financed through credit via central
banks. From a systems theory perspective, the price inflation and
currency inflation effects do not add, they multiply. And, given the
strong need to finance with credit, the dependency on central banking
then strongly influences international currency markets and foreign
currency reserves. The question is not whether expenditures and credit
of this magnitiude it will influence currency markets and reserves,
but how.

<a name="oh-you-cited-a-potential-gdp-increase-gdp-is-good" />

### [Oh You Cited A Potential GDP Increase & GDP is Good](#oh-you-cited-a-potential-gdp-increase-gdp-is-good)

Economics without mathematics modeled on graph theory is dangerously
oversimplified. Linear and non-linear systems modeled on top of graphs
can be understood at a high level through analysis of feedback loops
and systems theory. Economic manipulation and micromanagement
inevitably results in unintendend amplification to these feedback
loops, which results in general instability, poorly priced assets,
market inefficiency, misguided behavior patterns, misallocation of
wealth, and wholly artificial trends driven by small groups of
elitists with the right connections and influence. Generally speaking,
the combinations of positive and negative feedback loops in such a
system compose to amplify with magnitude of *products* of individual
effects and not *sums*. Such systems function healthiest and can be
most reliably predicted when left to function for themselves and when
artificial manipulation is restricted or at least transparent.

<a name="the-progression-of-automation-in-labor-markets" />

# [The Progression of Automation in Labor Markets](#the-progression-of-automation-in-labor-markets)

The perceived and actual ROI of employment roles depends on the degree
to which each role's tasks can be automated. For roles involving a
more complicated arrangement of tasks, the ability to completely
automate that role is inherently diminished. The structuring of roles
to task types changes as the labor markets evolve. Generally, if an
employment role involves a simpler set of task types, that role can be
automated away more quickly. If the set of task types is more complex,
there is a greater need for generalized AI. For each task type, the
complexity of the solutions nearly completely determines its potential
to be automated.

<a name="uber-and-gradual-automation-of-employment-roles" />

### [Uber and Gradual Automation of Employment Roles](#uber-and-gradual-automation-of-employment-roles)

Uber is a perfect example of how automation gradually overtakes
employment roles within a business or industry. Uber essentially
automated the taxi dispatcher and the task of navigation for drivers.

Once the problem of driving is tractibly solved, it would appear
economically advantageous to automate the driver. Uber may decide that
it wants to continue offering drivers or some such formulation of its
product, since a driver affects the customer experience.  Also, with
drivers, Uber has a platform composed of people invested in Uber's
success. These drivers also act as vectors for propagating dynamics
through social networks (i.e. marketing).

<a name="total-automation-cripples-the-human-network-effect" />

### [Total Automation Cripples the Human Network Effect](#total-automation-cripples-the-human-network-effect)

There are roles where automation appears to pay off on the surface, but
may not be. In the long term, automation may instead strongly detract
from certain aspects of your business and product, especially the
customer experience.  Total automation removes human social dimensions
from your product. Factors like these were ubiquitous before the 21st
century, so effects from their presence or absence in a product is not
well understood.

<a name="mental-labor-will-often-be-the-first-to-go" />

### [Mental Labor Will Often Be The First to Go](#mental-labor-will-often-be-the-first-to-go)

It's a common assumption, but mental labor is not safe. In fact, these
are some of the easiest and most effective roles to automate. For
roles involving mental labor, a trend will be to automate stages in
the role's decision making process, exposing vital data points in a
user interface. From there it's mostly thumbs up or thumbs down: the
employee in the mental labor role makes decisions as data is presented
to them. This essentially harnesses as
[dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction),
which is required for mitigating computational complexity in machine
learning.

<a name="clustering-dimensionality-reduction-and-groundhog-day" />

### [Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction and Groundhog Day](#clustering-dimensionality-reduction-and-groundhog-day)

With respect to dimensionality reduction, the curse of dimensionality
is not kind to humanity in the age of automation, where it before
allowed us to solve problems which would otherwise be intractible. For
almost any task type, if the complete analytical solution is
intractible, there's usually an efficient formulation involving
clustering and dimensionality reduction. This forms the basis of a
tractible analytical approximation to the original solution.

> Groundhog Day: on February 2nd, to predict the weather for the next
> six weeks, a computer can either completely process all the

Of course, there is no actual connection between the two. But without
needing to understanding the connection, a computer can identify
seemingly uncorrelated variables which can be use to construct an
approximate solution. The more data and the more proficient the
training, the more accurately its construction of approximated
solutions can be leveraged.

What that common assumption fails to grasp is the similarity of mental
labor to computation and the computational capacity of the human
brain, which still outpaces the sum of all supercomputers on Earth.
While user interface for the human brain is weak and requires years of
conditioning, someone in a mental labor is essentially performing many
of the same tasks that computers would. The human brain is
particularly good at identifying and correlating arbitrary data, which
provide data-processing shortcuts to some solution.

<a name="theres-always-money-in-the-banana-stand" />

### [There's Always Money In The Banana Stand](#theres-always-money-in-the-banana-stand)

A task type that forms a major dependency of AI-driven businesses is
in the data itself: data science, data processing infrastructure and
user interface. In this way, task types like these will be needed at
ever-increasing rates, but eventually, software, data-science and
infrastructure can all be automated. If someone lacks the equivalent
of a master's degree in either math or a field where math is strongly
applied, they are unlikely to be useful for data-science.

<a name="intergenerational-dynamics-of-technology-driven-unemployment" />

### [Intergenerational Dynamics of Technology Driven Unemployment](#intergenerational-dynamics-of-technology-driven-unemployment)

Over the next two decades, older members of the workforce will be hit
harder than younger members. This is because the demand for skills is
shifting and our education's capacity to imbue these skills is
accelerating. Double down on your IRA and keep an eye on your pension
fund.

<a name="a-sociocultural-paradox-of-technology-and-automation" />

### [A Sociocultural Paradox of Technology and Automation](#a-sociocultural-paradox-of-technology-and-automation)

All in all, the labor markets will favor those with highly varied
skill sets, which results in a paradox. Whereas automation leaves many
unemployed in an economy where high variety and proficiency of skills
determine employability, UBI as a policy detracts from the incentive
to work and to develop a highly varied set of skills. Why work if you
don't have to? Why learn or hone your skills in a difficult to
understand, ever-changing economy where the potential payout for each
acquired skill decreases year after year? What results is a cultural
feedback loop that magnifies the effect that automation has on the set
of behaviors humans reinforce. While automation and technology make us
more capable as a society, in the long term, it may result in broadly
disempowered individuals. Those with highly varied skill sets remain
employable and work to create tools which render their own skills
obselete.

What's left is a socioeconomic structure that neither provides
incentives to work nor rewards hard work proportionately, where the
citizens must maintain technology they don't understand built with
skills they mostly lack. They lack these skills because, while they
were in school, education didn't offer children a significant
perceived benefit, at least economically. In turn, these cultural
trends could render the domestic economy vulnerable to global
competition. Also, there are further interesting intergenerational
dynamics that could eventually emerge, where the oldest generation has
the widest variety of skills, which are mostly not propagated to
subsequent generations. Many of these assumptions depend on the
particular capabilities, practicality and limitations of neural
interfaces.

<a name="utopias-song" />

### [Utopia's Song](#utopias-song)

And this all occurs during the same period of time when generalized AI
may develop into a threat. When that time comes, shouldn't humanity be
as capable as possible? What we have to do is strive against this
paradox and resist being lulled into complacency by utopia.

<a name="the-employer-of-last-resort" />

# [The Employer of Last Resort](#the-employer-of-last-resort)

So we know that high unemployment rates are inevitable, given the
trajectory of technology and its impact on labor markets. We also know
that continued technological development is inevitable because any
alternative implies unsustainable population growth and/or a
transition of economic power to whoever develops the best
technology. So the question we need to ask is: how do we deal with
unemployment and other economic turbulence?

#### Policy Solutions Include:

#### &#x2605; Do nothing

#### &#x2605; Provide UBI (Ubiquitous Income)

#### &#x2605; National Service

Both of the latter generally involve growing the size of government
and increasing its range of influence on our lives. Still, doing
nothing is far worse. Both UBI and National Service are expensive
result in wide-reaching second and third order socioeconomic
effects. However, upon examining the potential higher order effects,
one finds that National Service is far preferable. Many of the
advantages of UBI, like opportunity for innovation and
experimentation, can be realized through much smaller grant programs.

<a name="national-service-catalyzes-sociocultural-transformation" />

### [National Service Catalyzes Sociocultural Transformation](#national-service-catalyzes-sociocultural-transformation)

Generally, we find that many of these domestic issues and their root
causes could be avoided or prevented outright, if only people were
more educated, responsible, insightful or temperate. How do you
catalyze your population to develop a robust set of knowledge and
skills? To imbibe a set of beliefs that naturally causes them to live
more responsibly? Given the right opportunities, the right incentives
and an accurate understanding of the world, people generally make the
best decisions for themselves and their families. Many of our domestic
problems are a result of ignorance, lack of foresight, myopic desire
and hopelessness.

The root causes of domestic issues in America are best addressed
through cultural transformation. Without such a transformation,
America is sure to succumb to domestic problems, like unrest, poverty,
economic turbulence and unemployment.

<a name="imprinting-universal-experiences" />

### [Imprinting Universal Experiences](#imprinting-universal-experiences)

National citizen service can be harnessed to imprint a near-universal
experience or widely-shared types of experiences. If these experiences
are common, they form the basis of pattern languages that help us
communicate and diagnose domestic issues. UBI does not provide this
opportunity for cultural transmission or the imprinting of types of
experiences. Unless one assumes the best case to represent the
majority (e.g. that people will react by altruistically using UBI as
an opportunity for personal development instead of hedonism or
netflix), then national service results in much preferable outcomes,
socioculturally. IMO, this altruistic best case would be rare.

<a name="national-service-drives-social-flux-and-tightens-the-social-graph" />

### [National Service Drives Social Flux and Tightens the Social Graph](#national-service-drives-social-flux-and-tightens-the-social-graph)

The development of connections in the social graph is driven through
interpersonal experiences. Many domestic issues in America are caused
by social isolation or at least could be ameliorated by methodically
reducing isolation in the social graph. These include poverty,
individual cases of mental heath, and the tendency for individuals to
become radicalized. All of these problems are worse in the context of
isolation.

In combination with data science, programs like national service can
be leveraged to methodically weave the social graph into one that is
stronger for all of us. When we have more connections, we have more
options. When there are more connections, information flows around the
social network. It converges faster and more completely. For example,
this can inform us of problems with friends or family or opportunities
for employment. This can weave together communities where individuals
otherwise might feel isolated. This stronger social net encourages
people to come together.

In the past, religion has been used to imprint experience types and to
encourage social flux, which induces transmission of information and
beliefs amoung its participants. Religious customs that are social,
like regular attendance of church, drive social flux that trigger
permeation of information through social networks. There are
evolutionary dynamics to religions and belief systems. There are real
benefits to their practices. The religions that managed to hold on to
believers were able to convey and provide value.

### [National Citizen Service for Young Adults](#national-citizen-service-for-young-adults)

Korea and Isreal are both countries which require mandatory military
service for young adults. Such mandatory service can be leveraged to
develop highly varied skill sets, making people more employable.

Mobilizing dozens of millions and integrating them all into a military
force is not an option. And a military force wouldn't exactly be
welcomed for international development of infrastructure. We'll need
to expand a force like Americorps or create new institutions. Human
capital to help build the foundations of underdeveloped economies,
which provides a framework for economic growth in the 21st century.

#### So it's 2036...

There's an oversaturated labor market where low demand and high
specificity in requirements for job roles renders several dozen
American adults unemployed. A higher proportion of the US government
budget is dedicated to expansive entitlement programs with less
leftover for the discretionary budget.

#### What do you do?

You fucking hope you played your cards right because it's going to be
tough no matter what you do. Large amounts of unemployed people
typically leads to unrest. It's better for people to be busy or at
least have their net human potential coordinated in some positive
way. Throughout history, we've been able to depend on economics and
self-interest to motivate people to work. Yet, at this point,
economics leads us to a place where that doesn't naturally happen.

#### We leverage our human capital to posture ourselves for maximal growth

Whatever we do to address the economic turbulence, we need to develop
a highly skilled labor force. If we're going to have to spend the
money, it should render our citizenry capable. So, to posture for
growth, we can rebuild infrastructure in America and build out
economic opportunities through cooperation with underdeveloped
economies.

### [The Upcoming Soft-Power Showdown With China](#the-upcoming-soft-power-showdown-with-china)

Furthermore, there is an upcoming soft-power showdown with China.  Two
decades of monopolar Western hegemony has yielded a naive generation
of Americans. We need to focus significant effort on building ties and
options for soft power and economic growth. China is mobilizing
quickly on projects in Pakistan and Africa. In order for China to
sustain GDP growth, they must expand. America, being multicultural,
has innately greater capacity to build bridges with the rest of
the world. In the long-term, these relationships are much more likely
to be seen as authentic and reciprocal.

### [Cost And Benefits of National Service](#cost-and-benefits-of-national-service)

The operational and logistical overhead in utilizing the government as
an employer of last resort sadly makes UBI seem more worthwhile. With
UBI, you simply deposit money in bank accounts and maybe mail some
checks. There's no real operational overhead or complex
logistics.

With national service, there is still significant disruption to the
domestic economy. How do you train and mobilize this many people while
minimizing disruption to private enterprises which can't easily
finance the labor?

Yet, if one is compelled to make a decision between UBI and an
employer of last resort, the capacity to seize on the latter to hit
fifty birds with one stone is undeniably more advantageous. It also
reduces the risk of large swaths of population being either idle or
feeling like their work and self-investment is rewarded
disproportionately. The 21st century is one of the great filters of
Fermi's paradox and we want to piss away all our money? If we go for
UBI, we will see revolution and transformation into something
requiring national service anyways.

### [More Intergenerational and Geoeconomic Dynamics](#more-intergenerational-and-geoeconomic-dynamics)

There are again intergenerational and geoeconomic dynamics of the
progression of unemployment via automation. These must be major
considerations when architecting the operational and logistical
aspects of a national service program. It's important to understand
that America isn't the only country facing this socioeconomic
transformation. The whole world must undergo this transition, but,
like modernization and industrialization, it will not unfold
simultaneously.

<a name="economic-sustainability" />

# [Economic Sustainability](#economic-sustainability)

When the government is paying the living expenses of 15-50% of the
population, it's hard to imagine this being economically
sustainable. Financing this requires that the government expend either
taxes or credit. If there is correlation between tax volume and
employment, which is certainly the case before the 21st century, then
the government expenditures to mitigate unemployment will be
unsustainable, if not at first, then eventually.

From an entrepreneur's perspective, the purpose of automation is
increase profit margins by reducing costs and improving efficiency.
Yet, a long-term result of automation is unemployment that
necessitates higher government expenditures, increasing the tax burden
on corporations.

Taxing automation is one sensible policy option to placate economic
turbulence, but this paradoxically makes these businesses less able to
compete with those from nations that don't tax automation. How did
globalization affect domenstic manufacturing and why? Corporations
moved overseas because they harnessed the cheapest source of labor
available. That's economics at work and similar dynamics will be in
play if automation is taxed.

### [I Hope All That Money Is Well Invested](#i-hope-all-that-money-is-well-invested)

If the policy response results in increased economic opportunity,
while enabling American enterprises to remain competitive, then it
will sustainable in the short-term. If it's not sustainable in the
long-term, then hopefully we got something good with all that
money. Ultimately, that will be what we are left with.

For example, if we utilize National Service to rebuild America's
infrastructure, then we have infrastructure. If we utilize National
Service to invest in underdeveloped economies, then American business
can leverage those global markets as a framework for further
growth. And, in case of robot apocalypse, our population has a
highly-developed skill set as a result. But, if we write $30,000
annual checks so that 15-50% of our citizens can watch two-thirds of
the Netflix catalog, then we're left with a population who
communicates poorly using sitcom references, but isn't employable or
able to contribute to society.

# [We Are the Sum of Humanity's Realized Potential](#we-are-the-sum-of-humanitys-realized-potential)

Economic growth ultimately stems from the net contributions of
individuals. It's built from the ground up. We know that we are going
to have dozens of millions of unemployed between ages 20 and 60 by the
2030's. The point is to invest that human potential and manpower to
get the greatest return possible in anticipation of greater future
threats to human existance. More challenging than the operational
aspects is convincing Americans that this is not only necessary, but
should be enthusiastically embraced when technology seems to remove
most constraints. To do this we need a cultural transformation to
produce a society built on values and character with a strong sense of
identity and duty.

# Part Four:

#### Governance in Space and the Post-Westphalian Era

The fourth part in this series is my fave. It covers the transition to
space, the accompanying economic shifts and the evolution of
governence mechanisms. As we approach the apex of globalization, we
reach the end of the Westphalian era. We find that transnationalism
wedges itself in the frame of international law and is used to contort
precedent. Then, as we begin to colonize space, humanity again
rearchitects our outermost paradigms of governance, leading to a
transition away from the brief post-Westphalian period.
