Agency is the capacity for some entity to be considered an independent
actor with the ability to interact on our shared sociophysical
fabric. Agents process information signals from their environment,
which can be conceptualized as sensory input or data. These sensory
perceptions are internalized into information representations.

Entities with agency can analyze and process these to inform its
actions. Agents have a degree of autonomy but do not exist in
isolation. They must have independence and the ability to influence
their environment. They may or may not be self-aware. They may
understand the exact consequences of their actions or may not, but it
is impossible for any entity to fully understand its influence on its
environment, regardless of how self-aware it is.

# [Primary Types of Entities With Agency](#primary-types-of-entities-with-agency)

There are at least three types of a

<a name="sentient-biological-life" />

### (1) [Sentient Biological Life](#sentient-biological-life)

First, there are sentient biological lifeforms: people and animals,
whose degree of awareness varies. These are simply information forms
that exist in systems of molecular dynamics which have evolved degrees
of antifragility.

Primarily, they evolved the ability to self-replicate. Some molecules
implicitly excel in this regard: namely the RNA and DNA. Even better,
these nucleic acids form macromolecules, whose higher level shape
interacts with the environment in functionally significant ways, in
ways no (singular) component of an organic macromolecule can
reproduce. This is what gave specific forms of RNA its evolutionary
advantage in molecular dynamics. It existed in a sea of myriad forms
of RNA, all bending, breaking and crucially self-replicating. The most
advantageous forms prevailed, the ribosome evolved from both RNA and
proteins, which is why it contains parts of both, even today. Pictured
below, tRNA likely resulted from spontaneous chains of nucleotides
complemented the shapes of the amino acids, which gave them some
evolutionary advantage in replication.

So, life is informational. In physics, energy can neither be created
nor destroyed and the same is true for information, which itself
preserves a history of energy distribution and interaction.

<a name="aphysical-autonomous-forms" />

### (2) [Aphysical Autonomous Forms](#aphysical-autonomous-forms)

In the past century, mankind has forged the telecom and computing
infrastructure, a loom onto which virtually instantiated automated
agents are woven. These are simply computer processes, spawned and
bound to physical and virtualized hardware, but they exhibit agency
because they have the capacity to react to and modify their
environment. Even such a minimalistic process should be considered an
entity of agency because their inherent autonomy is exploited to
deflect or defer causal inferences.

In the age of the internet, agents should include even entities as
simple as processes spawned from the command line that running a
network request, analyzing the response, and recording changes to the
file system. Regardless of whether that software process is
deterministic, it can be spawned or signaled by another entity with
agency and controlled. It is important to define such a minimum of
virtualized agency.

Computer software, hardware and networking architecture undergoes
cycles where emergent designs patterns and their anti-patterns drift
into and out of the consciousness of web developers, software
developers and mainframe developers -- but as with all else,
everything old is made anew. The older conceptions of containers of
software agencies -- a la, the linux process -- are better for
extrapolating inferences about upcoming computing trends than whatever
gimmicks du jour are in vogue.

The Docker revolution was about making LXC containers available to the
public, which are glorified means of facilitating declarative resource
distribution while retaining strict access control. LXC, in turn, is
like the Linux answer to BSD Jails and Solaris Containers. These are
all simply entities permitted degrees of autonomy, whose resource
requests (IRQ's) are restricted by the OS. Any of these types of
virtualization can be conceptualized at a high-level by abstracted
away the complexity into a process. The complexity is actually an
illusion. Try telling that to a mainframe programmer whose job has
been phased out via technical skill obscelence.

<a name="physicalized-autonomous-forms" />

### (3) [Physicalized Autonomous Forms](#physicalized-autonomous-forms)

Finally, there are physically-instantiated automated agents: robots,
which are simply the same form of agency with the flexibility of
physical interaction mechanics that makes them functionally distinct.

The latter two agent types proceed through evolutionary stages where
they churn back and forth in the qualities of traits they embody: they
become more physical, more aphysical; the exhibit varied degrees of
autonomy and restricted degrees of autonomy; they perhaps evolve to
some final informational form that transcends time, shedding their
temporality.

<a name="two-unconventional-types-of-entities-with-agency" />

# [Two Unconventional Types of Entities with Agents](#two-unconventional-types-of-entities-with-agency)

There are two unconventional types of agents, whose existence is
certainly debatable. Since they are not materially visible, they are
difficult to define. Still, if you accept biological life as
possessing sentience and agency when we are but
[genetic programs in the chaos of molecular dynamics](te.xel.io/posts/2017-09-14-awareness-precipitates-from-order-out-of-chaos.html),
then don't you have to accept the potential agency of information
forms that exist in other frameworks of chaos?

<a name="sociophysical-and-metaphysical-information-forms" />

### (4) [Sociophysical And Metaphysical Information Forms](#sociophysical-and-metaphysical-information-forms)

The first type includes sociophysical programs and egregores, which
can be dilineated by defining archetypical metaphysical
beings. Another example would include the earth as a lifeform -- the
[Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) --
exhibiting antifragile feedback loops that attempt to placate emergent
turbulence. If such antifragile systems did not mitigate rancorous
economic havoc, what cannot go on forever will not and hence, a dead
planet emerges.

#### Plato, Guarded Eternally By Athena The Wise

![Plato and Athena](/img/posts/2017-10-10-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/plato-and-athena)

These forms of agency seem to contrast the required autonomy and
independence of action. However, according to a holonic understanding
of human and biological life, the system cannot be understood simply
by looking at any single part or set of parts. Instead, a holistic
view of the system is required. Is there any mammal on earth which
does not aid its digestion with other lifeforms? The DNA of these
lifeforms is self-contained; animals have simply loaded a software
library from a genetic programming
[package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager). Therefore,
if many phenomena of biological lifeforms imply we cannot exist in
isolation -- and, a la biosphere, if the exertion of agency is
transformed by information inculcated via nature and nurture -- then
this implies qualities of agency exerted by biological forms are
strongly shaped by the system as a whole.

How different are the sociophysical information forms who lack some
true central container of agency? These forms can also self-replicate,
though their physical center of agency and application of it are both
amorphous. These entities are instead distributed across a virtual
fabric of many host entities. Today, this can include people,
computing and networking infrastructure. Their structure can include
and antifragile, self-healing mechanisms whereby deconstructed
components of the system spread and split like figurative sexual
recombination of information.

#### Shadow DOM, For Great Efficiency In The Web Application Era

![Shadow DOM](/img/posts/2017-10-10-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/shadow-dom.png)

<a name="adumbrated-entities-in-the-shadows-of-the-collective-unconsciousness" />

### (5) [Adumbrated Entities in the Shadows of the Collective Unconsciousness](#adumbrated-entities-in-the-shadows-of-the-collective-unconsciousness)

The second type of unconvential life form includes beings whose
shadows exist as information forms in the collective
unconsciousness. This would include God -- or man's conception of God
-- one such being that emerged from the collective unconsciousness.
How? The concept of monotheistic God represents a nadir of theistic
belief systems: monotheism is the most marketable basis for a belief
system. It is simple to digest, easy to understand and stable. It is
not subject to the same power dynamics as polythestic belief systems.

It's important to distinguish God from both man's inevitable
conception of God and man's actual conception of God. This needs to be
cautiously emphacized: nothing man could create approaches the
infinity of God. Even still, it is rash and potentially offensive to
state this.

The collective unconsciousness certainly exists, but how? And in what
form? If such information forms exist merely as the shadow of sentient
being's conceptions of their environment, can the collective
unconsciousness even possess have certain, definitive schematic
structure? Is it the result of what sentient beings envision; could
envision; could ever envision? Perhaps instead, its structure is also
intrinsically linked to the schematic form of the eternal
metaphysical: that which exists before the physical. Regardless of
whether its schema can be ascertained, what is certain is the power
that enigmatic force exerts on our world.

     slow, but I invested my time in reflection. Like all my other

<a name="dilineating-traits-of-entities-with-agency" />

# [Dilineating Traits of Entities With Agency](#dilineating-traits-of-entities-with-agency)

There are several traits shared among all types of entities that exert
agency.

<a name="perception-spectra-range-and-intensity-of-sensory-input" />

### [Perception: Spectra, Range and Intensity of Sensory Input](#perception-spectra-range-and-intensity-of-sensory-input)

What types of input signal can the entity or individual receive and
process? What are the costs in time and energy? Above, in Plato's
Republic, Socrates dilineates the five senses in a phenomenological
analysis. How such analysis must adapt to autonomous artificial
entities is the focus of debate. For these novel autonomous entities,
isn't all input a sense? Then, most of it is informational.

What is the cost to processing such types of sensory input? Vision is
always a hard problem, regardless of whether biological or artificial
hardware is processing the problem.

#### Socrates in [Plato's Republic, Book VI](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.7.vi.html):

> "But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and
> complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever
> contrived?"

In fact, because neural nets usually *functionally approximate*
algorithms, anything the do is inherently less efficient than the most
efficient solutions. Further, as a result of the abstract spectral
range of input, the facets of mind and the qualities of cognition that
arise are peculiar and idiosyncratic.

<a name="identity-comparability-precision-and-uniqueness" />

### [Identity: Comparability, Precision and Uniqueness](#identity-comparability-precision-and-uniqueness)

When we leverage these differences provided by diversity of body, mind
and culture, this is a strength. Our individual (shapes) are cast by
variety of life experience, and this allows us fill in each other's
gaps. We have to remember this. I take Nietzsche's philosophy about
the ubermensch seriously -- yet, this does not mean that one type of
individual is greater than another -- each of us has potential for
greatness in our own way. Unrestrained, we collectively have the most
potential to do the most good for others.

#### The Normal Distribution

![Picture of bell curve](/img/posts/2017-10-10-treatise-on-entity-and-agency/bell-curve.svg)

Those who study intelligence try to conceptualize IQ as
[Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
with an average -- but what they forget is that the divergent
individuals are all divergent in their own way. Can you average
apples, oranges, kiwis and dragonfruit? Further, we also forget that
we are running on the same biological hardware -- it is our experience
and the way we react to it that forms our mind. *If you ever believe
anything else, you have ceded control to fate or some force that seeks
to control you by convincing you that you are less than the radiant,
stellar being you were meant to be.*

One can replace vacuous desolation with verdant providence through
self-directed, larmarkian transformation of the individual, fueled by
sheer force of will and fantastical epigenetic mechanisms, whose power
transcends that of genetics. Why would we believe in limitations?
Believe in transcendence of those limitations; albeit irrational, the
power of mystery is sometimes our only hope.

The idea that you would compare the form of agents stems from math. It
is especially applicable to virtualized information forms: processes
are recognized by name, source code, or memory contents; antivirus
software operates by recognizing potentially malicious instruction
sets. Hashing algorithms enable digitally sign software to be
efficiently recognized and trusted. There are many ways to recognize
the same program that runs on different hardware. This is especially
relevant for the second and third types of agency.

Even if materialist conception of the mind prevails, where our
cognition and all consciousness is completely bound to chemical
reactions in the brain, they still represent and map to abstract
information forms. This is a virtualized information system and albeit
non-deterministic, it is similar in nature to a
[Universal Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine).
Consider a UTM's tape motions for some program, are they determined
moreso by the details of host UTM program or the encapsulated Turing
Machine? If you're trying to predict the tape's motions for some host
UTM, whose structure is either known or unknown, and for some TM who's
structure is unknown, doesn't the TM structure allow you to anticipate
the behavior of the tape moreso than understanding the host UTM that
virtualizes it? Only by deciphering the TM structure can you actually
anticipate the final state of the UTM & TM, and when or if it occurs.

Even though there are major differences in neurological and genetic
programs and non-deterministic systems of information virtualization,
there is certainly cyclicly interplay between the chemical system and
its information representations. More crucial to understanding how the
brain as a chemical system evolves are the stimili it is exposed
to. If you know the chemical state and can quantify the information
forms the brain exposes to the mind, you still must understand how the
physical stimili symbolically affect the system. Implying that, if
materialism prevails, then you are jumping the gun to claim that all
free will must be convenient illusion and all decisions are
predetermined by chemical reactions.

For identity of agents, even without quantum effects considered, two
biological configurations with identical body and brain are two
different beings, upon their first divergence of sensory stimuli.

For other conceptualizations of biological agents, it is impossible to
compare two people -- further, the application of this idea can lead
towards dangerous extrapolations. People tomorrow are always meant to
be more than what they where today. We are meant to grow and to never
stop growing. We are meant to plant these same seeds of inspiration in
others at every chance possible. We are meant to tend the soil of
society, so that it is more fertile for transformation and
self-actualization.

<a name="analysis-and-synthesis-capacity-methods-and-discernment" />

### [Analysis and Synthesis: Capacity, Methods and Discernment](#analysis-and-synthesis-capacity-methods-and-discernment)

Every entity with agency needs the capacity to process information,
even if it's a process that returns the data unaltered, incapable of
analyzing or mutating it whatsoever. Adept entities can discern
between methods of analysis and synthesis. Regardless of the agency
type, all entities attempt to balance energy minimalization with
confidence, risk and speed when possible. Even for non-physical
entities, the abililty to leverage selection and modular command of
cognitive faculties is always advantageous, especially for
minimization of energy.

Entities with agency possess the capacity to recognize, represent,
store and compare phenomena. Even those with some non-physical or
unconscious agency could be argued to internalize this information in
the noosphere or in its unconscious shadows.

<!-- not trying to brag bc that's dumb ... and it obviously hasn't
     worked out very well for me, has it? -->

One trait fundamental for distinguishing or identifying entities with
agency is the ability for concurrent processing of data or
signal. Multitasking is actually possible for humans -- but we have
the option for concerrency, not parallel processing of conscious
tasks. For concurrency in conscious human activity, one must open and
decentralize their focus, always practicing dynamic reconfiguration of
task and thought. It's incredibly difficult and ultimately not
practical: it requires constantly expending energy to remain aware of
potentially requeued, restacked and reordered task and
thought.

Most people only understand neurotypical patterns of thought and
rarely experiment with their operating mind: the only interface we
have to the world. Widening your focus and dynamically reallocating
your thought makes it difficult for others to understand what you're
thinking about. Moreover, the metacognitive faculty of dynamic
recombination of modular factulties is invigorated and made full via
constant experimentation with the mind and cognition. Forced reliance
on your weaknesses ensures they are strong when you need
them. Understanding how the mind formulates its cognitive approach to
tasks when you force yourself to constrain or filter sensory input
allows you to push your metacognition to the limit. Your mind is best
when it is well rounded: this harnesses aspects of neural network
design.

To many, AI's future remains uncertain. It's important we understand
the Singularity's sociocultural, phenomenological and teleological
consequences. To this end, complexity theory will help us anticipate
the teleological consequences of unrestrained classical and quantum
computing power. Perhaps by the end of the decade, the global sum of
computational power will exceed that of a single human
brain. Computational density, spatiotemporal distribution and
efficiency, are preeminant metrics and must be considered in context
with energy constraints.

Ideals like altruism are high-level behaviors which are more likely to
emerge with greater wetware processing capacity and flexibility. While
less-desirable behaviors can also emerge, ideal hyperintelligent
beings should evolve towards a singular zenith -- the ability to
emulate all other beings and states of being. While it's foolish to
simply discount the precarity of our approach to the Singularity, if
the human brain exhibits computational density and rock-bottom energy
requirements surpassing today's supercomputers, then AI's progression
should allow these superintelligent beings to embody or discover
higher values than humanity can know.

The potential is terrifying for such disparity in knowledge, awareness
and the ability to project will to manifest effects in any potentially
networked computer system. A superintelligent being, capable of
free-reign over its direction and raison d'etre, *should* be
altruistic -- but *only* when there is sufficient computational
capacity to skip past the 'danger' zone of superpowerful, immature AI.

In determining whether this argument holds, there is nothing more
crucial than understanding the progression and final distribution of
*agency* amoung Type 2 and Type 3 entities.  AI will prefer to compact
information for efficiency, at least as it is internally represented.
In other words, AI *may* regard spectral decoherence of information
inefficient in terms of energy and attempt to compact it by
influencing culture -- or it may avoid representing information it
doesn't need to deal with, resulting in a rift in the interface
between AI and humanity. On both points, engineers like those working
on Watson would be the best resource: they deal with information
representation & deconstruction in an attempt to consume and verify
facts. How this plays out depends strongly on how agency for AI
entities is distributed, logically and physically.

  - will for action applied to an objective
    - how to state this in a generalized way?
    - there are degrees of variation here:
      - people choose their own goals, or at least believe they do
      - automated agents will eventually attain this

- animus (soul)
  - distribution & influence

- direction: purpose, intent and goal
  - pheramone signaling in ants as protocols for the chemical
    transmission of information
  - for ants to attain progress in this direction, the biological
    components must incentivize this progress
    - the minds of all sentient beings facilitate expansion in
      capacity for analysis and synthesis of internalized information.
  - this is a kind of decentralized program, with biological and
    sociophysical components. common behavior patterns emerge in ant
    colonies tightly coupled to their adjecent environment and
    specifically the physical idiosyncrasies in their local
    environment. (reword this)
    - is the ant hill in the middle of African sahara or in a
      rainforest?
    - is the ant hill centered beside a McDonalds or a candy store?
    - the environment will sociophysically distort the ants social
      behavior: they will be attracted to further food sources with
      stronger signal.

  - consciousness is a spectrum. spontaneous insight provokes
    transcendence into higher forms of awareness. with greater and
    varied (capacity) for sentience, sensory input, analysis,
    synthesis and reflection, these spontaneous insights become more
    frequent.
    - humanity's own sociophysical programs may seem more complicated,
      but we are not unlike the ants, whose social behavior is so
      profoundly affected by their environment.
    - through tools like discernment, intuition and reflection, some
      of us find ourselves free of the environment's imposition,
      distortion and containment.
    - how do individuals become aware of the higher goals? how does
      humanity become aware of the highest goal?

- can we know it without seeing it? can we see it even if we know it?
  - if we are fortunate enough that a virtuous path becomes
    illuminated at our feet, what does it (take/cost) to follow it?
    - [where does it lead](/posts/2016-05-14-oneironautics-questing-for-lucidity.html#forging-a-path-home)?
    - isn't it simpler to follow when our light reflects off one
      another?
- We channel our spirit with the mind's (internalized understanding)
  of life and this goal.

Though we may seem greater, if the greats who came before us were
truly the greatest and this path becomes occluded, what then?

In the future, we'll forget creativity's eminence. It won't be
something we realize we miss once it's gone. The path from whence we
came will be hidden and inconstructible. Adumbrating sensory overload
will occlude our path, if we even think to look for it.

  - or some other entity with endless capacity/bandwidth for to

- as communication infrastructure provides the foundation for

  the (opening) in the veils that part us.
  - information omnipresence is only restrained by the degree and
    voracity of its own deluge
  - thus, we begin to converge:
    - our capacity for agency grows and we all become superempowered
      beings who share limitations on both our computational capacity
      and natural bounds on energy consumption.
    - the space between us dissolves. the speciation of information
      increases, but antifragile systems require some artificial
      constraints on spectral decoherence. therefore, there will be
      paradoxical trends of both coherence and decoherence. we must
      struggle to retain a sense of our humanity and identity or we
      lose the capacity to grow stronger, both individually and
      together. Notwithstanding our (need for memory of our humanity),
      we will all quite literally become one. If the information (that
      determines our) metaphysical identity wasn't hopelessly
      intractible, we could measure, analyze, synthesize and know
      this.
